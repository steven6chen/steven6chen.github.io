Physiologic cysts, such as a follicular cyst or corpus luteal cyst, or pathologic cysts may rupture (endometriomas, cystic components of benign or malignant neoplasms). In the normal menstrual cycle, the physiologic rupture of small follicular cysts that occurs with every ovulatory cycle is not typically clinically significant. This cyclic event is generally asymptomatic or associated with mild mid-cycle pain (also referred to as mittelschmerz).</p><p>Ovarian cyst rupture results in release of cyst fluid or blood that may irritate the peritoneal cavity. Dermoid cysts contain sebaceous fluid, hair, fat, bone, or cartilage, and rupture of these cysts results in severe peritoneal irritation. Surgical management is usually required for rupture of a dermoid cyst.</p><p>Most women with a ruptured ovarian cyst may be managed with observation, analgesics, and rest, but some women require surgery. Decisions regarding management are based upon patient characteristics, including the severity of symptoms, presence or ongoing bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/hemodynamic</span> instability, and the presumptive histologic diagnosis.</p><p>Diagnosis and management of women with a ruptured ovarian cyst are reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of adnexal masses that are not ruptured is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603355275\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of ruptured ovarian cysts is uncertain.</p><p>Hospital admission rates with a diagnosis of a benign ovarian cyst provide some information for calculating an incidence. However, these rates are an overestimate, because they also include admission for other complications of ovarian cysts (eg, hemorrhage, torsion). Some data suggest that 4 percent of women will be admitted to the hospital for an ovarian cyst by age 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In England and Wales, over a two-year period in the 1980s, the admission rate for an ovarian cyst was 67 women admitted per 100,000 women in the national populations; the rate was slightly higher in the United States at 131 per 100,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Ruptured ovarian cyst is most likely to occur in women of reproductive age, but may occur in postmenopausal women. In a series of 70 women with a ruptured corpus luteum, the average age was 27 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for rupture of follicular or corpus luteal cysts are associated with the likelihood of ovulation, which is increased with ovulation induction and decreased with the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives. However, estrogen-progestin contraceptives do not always prevent ovulation. In a review of the literature, the overall incidence of ovulation in estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive (OC) users was found to be 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Newer OCs with lower estrogen amounts were less likely to suppress ovulation compared with higher-dose OCs. Progestin-only pills were much less likely to suppress ovulation, at 42 percent.</p><p>Vaginal intercourse appears to be a risk factor for ovarian cyst rupture, although in some reports, postcoital hematoperitoneum without vaginal injury has been attributed to a ruptured cyst without visualization of a cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603355310\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no known methods to prevent rupture of an existing ovarian cyst, with the exception of surgical drainage or removal of the cyst. For women with an existing ovarian cyst, symptoms or suspicion of malignancy are indication for surgery for an adnexal mass, but prevention of cyst rupture is <strong>not</strong> a surgical indication.</p><p>Hormonal treatments that suppress ovulation may prevent the development of new cysts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-an-adnexal-mass#H2894375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of an adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Recurrent physiologic cysts'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture of an ovarian cyst may be asymptomatic or associated with a sudden onset of unilateral lower abdominal pain. The classic presentation is sudden onset of severe focal lower quadrant pain, often following sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Due to the severity of the pain, patients usually present to emergency departments or other urgent care settings.</p><p>The right ovary is most commonly affected, possibly because the rectosigmoid colon protects the left ovary from the effects of abdominal trauma. In a series of 244 cases of ovarian cysts, 63 percent were right-sided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603354976\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic or abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain associated with a ruptured ovarian cyst is typically unilateral lower quadrant pain. The character of the pain is typically sharp and focal. The intensity may be moderate or severe, and may increase shortly after the onset. The onset is sudden and often begins during strenuous physical activity, such as exercise or sexual intercourse. In cases of more massive hemorrhage, shoulder pain or upper abdominal pain is a feature due to subphrenic blood extravasation. In addition, patients may have increased pain with sitting, possible due to psoas irritation.</p><p>The pain associated with a ruptured ovarian cyst is thought to be due to an irritant effect, if there is blood from the rupture site. This may seep into the ovary, which can cause pain from stretching of the ovarian cortex, or it may flow into the abdomen, which has an irritant effect on the peritoneum. The visceral peritoneum may be more sensitive in some women compared with others. Just as ovulation pain is not always perceived in all women, some women may not perceive small amounts of hemoperitoneum.</p><p>Serous or mucinous fluid contained within the cyst may be released upon cyst rupture. These fluids are not very irritating; the patient may remain asymptomatic despite accumulation of a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid. On the other hand, spillage of sebaceous material upon rupture of a dermoid cyst causes a marked granulomatous reaction and chemical peritonitis, which is usually quite painful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Teratomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603354982\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the evaluation is to arrive at a diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst and exclude ruptured ectopic pregnancy, which has a similar clinical presentation, or other etiologies. For women with a ruptured ovarian cyst, bleeding often occurs and hemodynamic status is assessed as a key determinant of whether surgery is indicated or the patient can be managed with observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616880976\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and characteristics of the pelvic or abdominal pain are elicited, if present.

Any signs of hemodynamic instability require that evaluation for bleeding and potential surgery be expedited. It should be noted that healthy young patients may lose a significant amount of blood before a change in blood pressure or pulse are seen. Paradoxically, some women with acute hemoperitoneum and hypotension may not show tachycardia or may display bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Significant hemorrhage leading to shock is uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal examination &ndash; One side of the lower abdomen is often tender to palpation. As noted above, the right lower quadrant is most commonly affected. Rupture of a simple cyst usually results in only mild to moderate tenderness on deep palpation. At the other end of the spectrum, release of sebaceous material or blood into the abdomen may cause overt peritonitis with rigidity of the abdominal wall and rebound tenderness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intraabdominal hemorrhage may be associated with Cullen's sign (ie, periumbilical ecchymoses) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88950\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88950 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic examination &ndash; If the cyst has not completely collapsed, an adnexal mass may be palpable on bimanual examination. Cervical motion tenderness may also be present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603355123\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We order the following laboratory studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum or urine pregnancy testing (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) &ndash; If the hCG is positive, then the patient must be evaluated for ectopic pregnancy with a pelvic ultrasound. Ruptured ovarian cysts do occur in pregnant women, but ectopic pregnancy is more likely to be life-threatening than cyst rupture, and should be excluded first. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential &ndash; A low hematocrit may be caused by hemorrhage or baseline anemia, although the initial hematocrit may be normal or mildly decreased with acute blood loss. Severe thrombocytopenia can worsen bleeding associated with cyst rupture. The white blood cell count is typically normal or only mildly elevated with cyst rupture; therefore, leukocytosis or left shift should raise suspicion of an infectious or necrotic process as the etiology of the symptoms rather than cyst rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood type and crossmatch is indicated in patients with peritoneal signs or hemodynamic instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine, cervical, or blood tests for sexually transmitted infections should be obtained from patients with concomitant fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peritoneal symptoms to exclude pelvic or urinary tract infection.</p><p/><p>Of note, we do not test serum CA 125 routinely in patients with a suspected ruptured ovarian cyst. This test is sent only if there is a suspicion of ovarian cancer and the result is not likely to be available quickly enough to impact immediate management. It is important to note that CA 125 may be elevated with hemoperitoneum or irritation of the peritoneum by cyst contents, as well as a number of other benign conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81621 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Sonographic findings of an adnexal mass and fluid in the pelvis suggest a ruptured ovarian cyst, but are not diagnostic, because fluid may be present in the pelvis without a ruptured cyst. Small amounts of anechoic fluid in the pelvis are seen in women of reproductive age. If the fluid has debris within it, then it is suspicious for blood (for example, from a ruptured cyst or an ectopic pregnancy) or infection.</p><p>Rupture of cyst contents typically yields only a small pool of peritoneal fluid, but large amounts of fluid may be present if rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage.</p><p>Preoperative sonography may show features suggestive of malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109384 \">table 3</a>) or a specific pathology (eg, dermoid cyst). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do not find computed tomography to be useful in the evaluation of a ruptured ovarian cyst. In addition, historically, culdocentesis was performed, but this is not used in current practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst is made clinically based upon a symptom pattern that is consistent with this condition. Sonographic findings contribute to the diagnosis. A finding of a combination of an ovarian cyst and blood or a large amount of serous fluid in the pelvis makes the diagnosis highly likely. An ovarian cyst may or may not be visualized, since it may collapse after cyst rupture. However, the absence of a cyst makes the diagnosis less likely, and additional emphasis should be put on excluding other etiologies.</p><p>In patients who are managed surgically, the diagnosis is confirmed upon visualization of an ovarian cyst that is leaking fluid or blood or has evidence of capsular disruption. However, surgical confirmation is not required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst includes other conditions associated with pelvic or abdominal pain, hemoperitoneum, or a peritoneal fluid collection. The highest priority is to exclude ectopic pregnancy, which presents similarly with a sudden onset of pelvic pain. Other urgent conditions that present similarly are adnexal torsion or appendicitis. The most common or urgent differential diagnoses are discussed here; the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and evaluation of acute pelvic pain is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic or abdominal pain</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ectopic pregnancy is the most important diagnosis to exclude, since it may be life-threatening. In women with acute pelvic pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test strongly suggests the presence of an ectopic pregnancy if an intrauterine pregnancy cannot be visualized sonographically. If an intrauterine pregnancy is visualized, then pelvic pain and intraperitoneal fluid could be due to a ruptured ovarian cyst (eg, corpus luteum cyst, theca lutein cyst) or heterotopic pregnancy. Bleeding is less common with a ruptured cyst, but does occur in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adnexal torsion is another condition that closely mimics the presentation of a ruptured cyst. This requires urgent surgery to avoid a negative impact on the function of the ovary or fallopian tube. Nausea and vomiting frequently accompany torsion, but are less common with cyst rupture. Imaging studies show an enlarged edematous ovary on the side of the patient's pain. Doppler examination may or may not show flow to the ovary due to the dual arterial blood supply. When a cyst is the cause of torsion, and the patient has pain with associated fluid, the distinction between a ruptured cyst and torsion may be difficult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Appendicitis is another urgent condition that presents with lower abdominal pain. The typical time course and character of the pain are somewhat different for appendicitis, for which the classic presentation is dull periumbilical pain followed by sharp pain that localizes to the right lower quadrant if rupture occurs. Appendicitis is also classically accompanied by nausea, anorexia, and a low-grade fever. Since the presence of an ovarian cyst is common, this may not be the source of the symptoms, and this finding alone should not exclude a diagnosis of appendicitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) &ndash; Lower abdominal pain is the cardinal presenting symptom in women with PID. The onset of pain is more gradual than that with ruptured ovarian cysts, it is likely to occur during or shortly after menses rather than midcycle, and it is typically bilateral rather than unilateral. Free intraperitoneal fluid (pus) may or may not be observed on imaging. Abnormal uterine bleeding occurs in one-third of patients with PID and about 50 percent have leukocytosis or fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tubo-ovarian abscess &ndash; These are a subset of PID. Rupture of a tubo-ovarian abscess is associated with a sudden onset of pain and requires urgent treatment to avoid sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) &ndash; OHSS is an iatrogenic complication of ovulation induction therapy and may be accompanied by or mistaken for cyst rupture. Severe OHSS is characterized by large ovarian cysts, ascites, and, in some patients, pleural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericardial effusion, electrolyte imbalance (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), hypovolemia, and hypovolemic shock. Marked hemoconcentration, increased blood viscosity, and thromboembolic phenomena including disseminated intravascular coagulation occur in the most severe cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other gynecologic issues associated with pelvic pain include endometriosis, leiomyomas, and endometritis, and mittelschmerz. Acute pain occurs infrequently with these conditions. Mittelschmerz is pain with ovulation, likely due to the release of blood upon follicular capsule rupture at ovulation, this then results in peritoneal irritation. This is the rupture of a small ovarian cyst, but the pain is typically mild and the amount of blood is minimal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3234103847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;, section on 'Luteal phase: Mid-cycle surge and ovulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometritis-unrelated-to-pregnancy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometritis unrelated to pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Acute endometritis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H3525968608\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Pelvic pressure or pain'</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nongynecologic etiologies of a pain pattern similar to a ruptured ovarian cyst include appendicitis, as noted above, and nephrolithiasis, interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and diverticulitis. Acute episodes of abdominal pain are a common manifestation of vasoocclusive events in women with sickle cell disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Acute painful episodes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoperitoneum</strong> &ndash; The most common gynecologic causes of hemoperitoneum are ruptured ovarian cyst and ectopic pregnancy. Hemoperitoneum may also be related to a hepatic, splenic, vascular, or coagulopathic etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In such cases, it is often due to blunt or penetrating traumatic injury to a visceral organ (especially the liver or spleen) or blood vessel, but may be spontaneous. Aneurysms (aorta, iliac, or splenic artery), pseudoaneurysms, and veins may rupture and cause hemoperitoneum. Intraabdominal bleeding can also be caused by a perforated gastric ulcer or spontaneous splenic rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peritoneal fluid</strong> &ndash; Myriad conditions are associated with visualization of small amounts of peritoneal fluid on ultrasound or other imaging studies. The most common causes of moderate to severe ascites are cirrhosis, cancer, congestive heart failure, and tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with ascites&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with ovarian cyst rupture have an uncomplicated case and are candidates for observation. Complicated cases may require inpatient management <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery.</p><p>Once the diagnosis of a ruptured cyst has been made, characteristics of a complicated cyst rupture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of hemodynamic instability &ndash; Hypotension, tachycardia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of ongoing or heavy blood loss &ndash; Women with a ruptured ovarian cyst often bleed a small or moderate amount and the bleeding is self-limited. Such cases are uncomplicated. In some patients, however, there is a large blood loss that then stops or heavy ongoing bleeding. In these patients, there will be sonographic evidence of a large amount of hemoperitoneum. If bloody-appearing fluid is seen extending beyond the upper margin of the uterus on ultrasound, then the upper abdomen should be evaluated by sonogram to exclude a large amount of hemoperitoneum. On abdominal examination, women with a large volume of intraperitoneal blood will have tenderness and possibly peritoneal signs. In more severe cases, the vital signs will show hemodynamic instability and the patient may report dizziness or lightheadedness. Anemia may be present on lab testing. However, as noted, in a healthy young woman, a large blood loss that occurs quickly may not immediately show a change in vital signs or anemia. (See <a href=\"#H603354982\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of an infectious process &ndash; Fever, leukocytosis, and peritoneal signs suggest that there is an intraperitoneal infectious process, and require further evaluation. A low-grade fever may be present in some women with a ruptured cyst, but a fever &ge;100.4 may be a sign of an additional infectious process. Peritoneal signs may be present due to the presence of a large hemoperitoneum or irritation from cyst contents, particularly with a dermoid cyst. However, it may also indicate intraperitoneal infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings suggestive of malignancy &ndash; Postmenopausal women with an ovarian mass frequently have benign ovarian tumors, but malignancy must be excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncomplicated cyst rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with an uncomplicated rupture of an ovarian cyst, we recommend observation rather than surgical intervention. There are no data comparing these two strategies in this patient population, but if there are no concerns about ongoing brisk bleeding or infection or malignancy, the risks of surgery are not warranted.</p><p>These patients can usually be managed as outpatients as long as they are hemodynamically stable without a significant drop in hematocrit. In our practice, we tend to counsel these patients with similar precautions given to patients with conservative management of an ectopic pregnancy. They should return for increased pain or lightheadedness. Oral analgesia is given as needed. Nonhemorrhagic cyst fluid is usually resorbed within 24 hours and symptoms typically resolve within a few days. Follicular and corpus luteum cysts account for most of these cases.</p><p>Many of these patients will still have a cyst remaining after cyst rupture, since the cyst wall may reapproximate. After observation is complete, these patients should be managed as appropriate. This includes continued surveillance until the cyst resolves and possible surgery at a later time if the cyst is symptomatic or if malignancy is suspected.

In our experience, bleeding will stop in the majority of cases. This may be due to tamponade from increased intraabdominal pressure caused by the volume of blood. Management of these patients is based upon clinical evaluation and balancing avoidance of surgery with the likelihood of ongoing bleeding. There are no high-quality data to guide the choice of management of these patients.</p><p>We rely on the patient's vital signs and hematocrit. If the patient has stable vital signs and a stable hematocrit, we suggest hospitalization and fluid replacement rather than immediate surgery. Close observation includes frequent vital signs, serial hematocrit testing, and repeated pelvic ultrasound to monitor for an increased volume of blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After bleeding has stopped, a large volume hemoperitoneum may take several weeks to resolve. For patients managed with observation, after discharge we have them follow up the following week in clinic, or sooner if they are having any symptoms of pain or lightheadedness.</p><p>If on serial evaluation, the hematocrit continues to decrease or the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, we recommend surgery rather than transfusion alone. The concern for transfusion is a briskly bleeding vessel will not tamponade and further blood loss may be ongoing. Thus, the patient may be exposed to blood products and still require surgery.</p><p>Regarding transfusion, we transfuse if a patient has a drop in hematocrit but has stabilized (as defined by serial similar hematocrits), but is orthostatic by blood pressure or heart rate criteria.</p><p>Surgery is performed to control hemorrhage if the patient's clinical condition is unstable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616882504\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical approach because it results in less morbidity than laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

For these reasons, we suggest emergency surgery if a ruptured dermoid cyst is suspected. Surgical intervention includes suction of spilled ovarian cyst contents, irrigation and suction to eliminate any residual sebaceous material, and cystectomy.

Cyst rupture may be asymptomatic or may be characterized by the sudden onset of unilateral, lower abdominal pain. The onset of pain is often during strenuous physical activities, such as exercise or sexual intercourse. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the evaluation is to arrive at a diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst and exclude ruptured ectopic pregnancy, which has a similar clinical presentation, or other etiologies. For women with a ruptured ovarian cyst, bleeding often occurs and hemodynamic status is assessed as a key determinant of whether surgery is indicated or the patient can be managed with observation. (See <a href=\"#H603354982\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst is made clinically based upon a symptom pattern that is consistent with this condition. Sonographic findings contribute to the diagnosis. A finding of a combination of an ovarian cyst and serous fluid or blood in the pelvis makes the diagnosis highly likely. In general, fluid or blood is present. An ovarian cyst may or may not be present, since it may not be visualized after cyst rupture. The absence of a cyst makes the diagnosis less likely, and additional emphasis should be put on excluding other etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential diagnosis includes other conditions associated with pelvic or abdominal pain, hemoperitoneum, or a peritoneal fluid collection. The highest priority is to exclude ectopic pregnancy, which presents similarly with a sudden onset of pelvic pain. Other urgent conditions that present similarly are adnexal torsion or appendicitis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyst rupture is uncomplicated in the absence of hemodynamic instability, large volume or ongoing blood loss, fever and leukocytosis, and suspicion of malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with uncomplicated cyst rupture, we recommend expectant management rather than surgical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Later surgical intervention may be indicated for diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cysts that are large or persistent, and those with findings suspicious for malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated cyst rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women with a ruptured ovarian cyst who are hemodynamically stable and have significant hemoperitoneum, we suggest hospitalization, close observation, and fluid replacement rather than immediate surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Close observation includes frequent vital signs, serial hematocrit testing, and repeated pelvic ultrasound to monitor bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Heavy or ongoing blood loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is required if ongoing hemorrhage needs to be controlled <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the patient's clinical condition is unstable. Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical approach because it results in less morbidity than laparotomy. In a premenopausal woman with a benign ovarian cyst (physiologic or nonphysiologic), preservation of ovarian tissue via cystectomy is generally preferable to complete oophorectomy. Consultation with a gynecologic oncologist is recommended if ovarian malignancy is suspected.
