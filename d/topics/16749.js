This disorder can lead to hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and hypercarbia (increased carbon dioxide levels) in the blood. Severe hypoxia results in anaerobic glycolysis and lactic acid production first in the peripheral tissues (muscle and heart) and then in the brain. Ischemia (lack of sufficient blood flow to all or part of an organ) is both a cause and a result of hypoxia. Hypoxia and acidosis can depress myocardial function, leading to hypotension and ischemia. Ischemia can impair oxygen delivery, causing further compromise, as well as disrupt delivery of substrate and removal of metabolic and respiratory by-products (eg, lactic acid, carbon dioxide).</p><p>The systemic complications of perinatal asphyxia are reviewed here. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), including pathogenesis, pathology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asphyxia can occur before, during, or after birth. Based on a review of multiple studies that have examined the temporal relationship between obstetric events and neonatal outcomes, predominantly hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term infants, the proportion of conditions that occurs in each time period can be estimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Antepartum events, such as maternal hypotension or trauma, account for 4 to 20 percent of cases. Intrapartum events, such as placental abruption or umbilical cord prolapse, are seen in 56 to 80 percent. Evidence of intrapartum disturbance (eg, meconium-stained amniotic fluid or severe fetal heart rate abnormalities) occurs in 10 to 35 percent, usually in association with an antenatal risk factor, such as diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In approximately 10 percent of cases, a postnatal insult occurs, usually caused by severe cardiopulmonary abnormalities or associated with prematurity.</p><p>However, the timing of injury often is difficult to establish for an individual infant, in part because antepartum and intrapartum events may not lead to signs that are detectable in the fetus. In addition, a fetus who has suffered an antepartum insult may be at increased risk of incurring further intrapartum injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of maternal, obstetric, and neonatal conditions predispose the fetus and newborn to asphyxia. These risk factors are associated with reduced blood flow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oxygenation to the tissues.

In diabetic women, vascular disease, manifested by nephropathy, may contribute to the development of fetal hypoxia and subsequent perinatal asphyxia. Infants with severe IUGR who are deprived of oxygen and nutrients may have a difficult cardiopulmonary transition with perinatal asphyxia, meconium aspiration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent pulmonary hypertension.

This test involves the sonographic assessment of four discrete biophysical variables (fetal movement, fetal tone, fetal breathing, amniotic fluid volume), and the results of nonstress testing. A compromised fetus typically exhibits loss of accelerations of the fetal heart rate (FHR), decreased body movement and breathing, hypotonia, and, less acutely, decreased amniotic fluid volume. If fetal asphyxia is detected, appropriate intervention may prevent adverse sequelae.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the most widely studied, as it has the most serious sequelae. In contrast to the persistence of neurologic injury, dysfunction of other organs can resolve before hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy#H491308911\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Information on the systemic effects of perinatal asphyxia can be extracted from data from the control groups of clinical trials studying the effects of hypothermia on the outcome of HIE. The scope of organ involvement in perinatal asphyxia varies among studies depending in part upon the definitions used for asphyxia, as demonstrated by the following trials in infants with gestational age (GA) &ge;36 weeks.</p><p>In the first trial, inclusion criteria were Apgar score of five or less, need for continued resuscitation, or severe acidosis (umbilical cord blood pH &lt;7 or a base deficit of &ge;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and evidence of moderate to severe HIE by neurologic assessment (eg, lethargy, stupor, coma, hypotonia, or abnormal reflexes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Issues related to HIE are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOCARDIAL DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asphyxia may cause myocardial ischemia, which usually is transient, but may rarely result in cardiogenic shock and death. This condition typically presents as impaired myocardial contractility, decreased cardiac output, and tricuspid insufficiency, although some infants have signs of respiratory distress, heart failure, or shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination in affected patients shows tachypnea, tachycardia, and hepatomegaly consistent with heart failure. Systemic blood pressure may be low and capillary refill delayed, reflecting reduced peripheral perfusion. However, normal blood pressure can be present in infants with poor cardiac output, a phenomenon related to elevated peripheral vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Many infants have a systolic murmur that is loudest at the lower left sternal border, typical of tricuspid insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest radiograph typically shows cardiomegaly. The appearance of pulmonary blood flow depends upon whether the left or right ventricle is predominantly affected. If left heart failure predominates, the lung fields usually are diffusely hazy, with pulmonary venous congestion. If the right side is more affected, pulmonary blood flow may be reduced by right-to-left atrial shunting, and pulmonary congestion may be absent.</p><p>The ECG may show signs of ischemia, with diffuse ST-T wave changes. The most common finding is ST depression in the midprecordium, with persistently inverted T-waves over the left precordium. ECG abnormalities still present at 72 hours of life may be associated with an increased risk of mortality.</p><p>The diagnosis of myocardial dysfunction may be confirmed by echocardiographic findings of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and decreased shortening fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Echocardiography, which should be obtained in all infants in whom myocardial dysfunction is suspected, is essential to exclude structural heart disease. It also distinguishes right-to-left atrial shunting caused by myocardial dysfunction from that due to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), which is important since management differs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Functional echocardiography and other advanced echocardiographic techniques (myocardial performance index or Tei index) appear to be more sensitive than routine echocardiography measurements in identifying cardiac impairment in asphyxiated newborns, but their relation to long term outcomes remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p>No laboratory test reliably detects cardiac damage in perinatal asphyxia. Levels of creatinine kinase and its MB fraction in cord blood or venous samples in the first 12 hours after birth do not distinguish infants with and without asphyxia and are not specific for cardiac damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Neonatal levels may be elevated in the first day of life due to gestation, weight, and type of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, elevation of cardiac troponin T and I levels is specific for cardiac dysfunction, occurs during the first 12 hours of age, and appears to correlate with the severity of asphyxia and neurodevelopment at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/7,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10-13</a>]. In one study, troponin T levels in asphyxiated infants were not only significantly higher than in control infants (0.17 versus 0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> but a troponin &ge;0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> predicted mortality (100 percent specific, 70 percent sensitive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management is supportive. Patients with respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation. Ventilator pressures should be as low as possible to minimize limitations to venous return and cardiac output. Metabolic abnormalities, such as hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and acidosis, should be corrected. Fluids are restricted, and diuresis is promoted. Inotropic agents usually are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Severely affected patients may require afterload reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal dysfunction often accompanies perinatal asphyxia. The presentation and course depend upon the severity and duration of the hypoxic-ischemic event. Severe asphyxia results in diffuse tubular dysfunction with impaired reabsorption of sodium and water and decreased glomerular filtration rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A milder insult may cause a transient loss of renal concentrating ability. Even in patients treated with hypothermia therapy, AKI occurs in about one-third of patients and is associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute renal failure, or acute kidney injury (AKI), can be difficult to diagnose following asphyxia for a variety of reasons, including the lack of a consensus definition. AKI should be suspected if the serum creatinine concentration is increased (&gt;1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 88 to 133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the urine output is reduced (&lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour). However, renal failure after perinatal asphyxia may be non-oliguric in up to 50 percent of neonates, and serum creatinine levels can be highly variable in the first days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In one report, renal function was evaluated in 66 asphyxiated infants with gestational age (GA) &ge;36 weeks and five minute Apgar scores &le;6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Acute renal failure, defined as serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> occurred in 20 of 33 infants who were considered to have severe asphyxia. Of these, renal failure was nonoliguric, oliguric, or anuric in 60, 25, and 15 percent, respectively. In another prospective case controlled study of 70 asphyxiated infants, 33 patients (47 percent) exhibited renal failure, of which 7 were oliguric and 26 were non-oliguric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Urine levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) have been investigated as markers of AKI following perinatal asphyxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-effects-of-perinatal-asphyxia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, it remains unclear whether urinary NGAL levels or other biomarkers are useful in the clinical management of AKI in neonates with perinatal asphyxia. As a result, use of this biomarker remains investigational.</p><p>The diagnosis, evaluation, and management of AKI are discussed separately.

Myocardial ischemia typically presents as impaired myocardial contractility, decreased cardiac output, and tricuspid insufficiency, and in severe cases, respiratory distress, heart failure, or shock. The diagnosis of myocardial dysfunction is confirmed by echocardiography. In affected neonates, the management is supportive with the use of mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure, correction of metabolic abnormalities, the use of inotropic agent and diuretics, and fluid restriction. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Myocardial dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute kidney injury (AKI) often accompanies perinatal asphyxia. The presentation and course of AKI depend upon the severity and duration of the hypoxic-ischemic event. Severe asphyxia results in diffuse tubular dysfunction with impaired reabsorption of sodium and water and decreased glomerular filtration rate. A milder insult may cause only a transient loss of renal concentrating ability. AKI should be suspected if the serum creatinine concentration increases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the urine output is reduced.
