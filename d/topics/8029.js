Combined heart and lung transplantation is limited to patients in whom it offers the only surgical option for their end-stage cardiac and pulmonary disease. The procedure of choice for pulmonary parenchymal and vascular diseases in the absence of left heart dysfunction is single or double lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: General guidelines for recipient selection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The first heart-lung transplantation was performed in 1981 in a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The indications for the procedure were subsequently expanded to include patients with severe parenchymal lung disease and congenital heart disease complicated by Eisenmenger syndrome.

The most common indication for heart-lung transplantation is complex congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger syndrome (systemic-to-pulmonary communication, pulmonary arterial disease causing severe pulmonary hypertension, and cyanosis). Heart-lung transplant is also indicated in patients with concomitant end-stage pulmonary disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension [IPAH] or cystic fibrosis) <strong>and</strong> either right ventricular failure with objective evidence of right ventricular fibrosis or infarction or refractory left ventricular failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The 2016 International Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry summarized the distribution of diagnoses leading to adult heart-lung transplantation from January 2004 to June 2015 (slides available at <a href=\"http://www.ishlt.org/registries/slides.asp?slides=heartlungregistry&amp;token=x3djU/gR9hjQlMCTrO0sVuK+SR0v2blvAp6zVM7beggKVWo4WlskTJV/fKqLGVmCAAfFS7t8NgCS9aW6GNsiaAxJOCiH1AxjICG9ErEq6Fk=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3525\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.ishlt.org/registries/slides.asp?slides=heartLungRegistry</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The three leading indications were congenital heart disease (35.5 percent), IPAH (27.3 percent), and cardiomyopathy (11.2 percent). </p><p>Where possible, isolated lung or heart transplantation is preferred to heart-lung transplantation because of several major disadvantages with the combined procedure. The need to procure a heart&ndash;lung block can lead to increased waiting time and increased mortality among patients awaiting combined heart-lung transplantation compared with those waiting for isolated heart or lung transplants. Other disadvantages include exposure of the recipient to risks of both graft coronary artery vasculopathy and chronic lung allograft dysfunction. In addition, heart-lung recipients may be disadvantaged by the obligate requirement for cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery and the physiological effects of a denervated heart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The preference for single and double lung transplantation has markedly reduced the need for the combined heart-lung procedure. In addition, the availability of new medical therapies for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger syndrome has also reduced the need for heart-lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.) The magnitude of this effect was shown in the 2015 ISHLT Registry report, which noted a 40 percent decrease in the number of centers that reported performing heart-lung transplants since 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The total number of adult procedures reported has stabilized since 2003, ranging from 58 to 95 per year, compared with an increasing number of single and double lung transplants (3973 in 2014) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 2014, only 58 heart-lung transplants were reported at 40 centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During the period from January 2002 to June 2015, overall, the number of procedures for congenital heart disease and IPAH largely plateaued; there were fewer procedures performed for cystic fibrosis and more procedures performed for acquired heart disease compared with earlier eras [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined heart-lung transplantation is the preferred procedure for patients with complex congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger syndrome (including those with single ventricle anatomy), unsuccessfully repaired or uncorrectable lesions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severely depressed left ventricular function. </p><p>For patients with acquired heart disease, a pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt;50 mmHg and either elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; defined as &gt;3 Wood units), or a transpulmonary pressure gradient &gt;15 mmHg on right heart catheterization is a relative contraindication to isolated cardiac transplantation due to the risk of right heart failure and early death in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These patients should be tested with vasodilator challenge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated medically with mechanical adjuncts as needed (eg, intra-aortic balloon pump <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular assist device [LVAD]) to achieve acceptable hemodynamics (with testing three to six months after LVAD initiation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients whose PVR can be reduced to &lt;4 Wood units (320 <span class=\"nowrap\">dynes-sec/cm<sup>5</sup>)</span> without a fall in systolic blood pressure &lt;85 mmHg are usually considered acceptable candidates for isolated heart transplantation. If PVR fails to improve despite these measures, pulmonary hypertension is deemed irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pulmonary hypertension with irreversible PVR &ge;4 Wood units is commonly considered a contraindication to isolated heart transplantation and in this setting, heart-lung transplantation may be considered as an alternative. However, some centers have successfully performed heart transplantation in patients with irreversible PVR &ge;4 Woods units on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;, section on 'Transplantation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support#H22787804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;, section on 'Bridge to transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with end stage lung disease and repairable cardiac diseases (eg, coronary artery disease, valvular disease) without intrinsic myocardial dysfunction, corrective cardiac surgery with concomitant lung transplantation is preferable to heart-lung transplantation. Thus, bilateral lung transplantation with repair of the congenital defect is the recommended procedure in patients with simple congenital heart disease. These lesions include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial or ventricular septal defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scimitar syndrome, which refers to the triad of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, hypoplasia or aplasia of a lobe of the right lung (most often), and the presence of thoracic aorta to pulmonary artery collaterals to the small lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary venous stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A functionally inadequate vascular bed as with multiple peripheral pulmonary arterial stenoses or pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.</p><p/><p>Orthotopic heart transplantation alone is a potential option for patients with congenital heart disease and a physiologic single lung (eg, unilateral pulmonary venous stenosis, or due to previous aortopulmonary shunt procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173931260\"><span class=\"h3\">Lung diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and preserved left ventricular function, there is no advantage to heart-lung transplantation compared with isolated bilateral lung transplantation, even in the presence of significant right ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Such patients should generally be treated with lung transplantation alone, unless there are unusual issues such as massive cardiac enlargement, which would not allow adequate intrathoracic space for lung implantation. However, some centers prefer heart-lung transplantation for patients with severe right ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Patients with pulmonary hypertension represent a heterogenous group not only in terms of mechanism leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension but also in regard to presence and degree of right <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular dysfunction. The choice between heart-lung transplantation and bilateral lung transplantation is based upon the clinical setting. As mentioned above, patients with complex congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger syndrome are best served by heart-lung transplantation while patients with pulmonary hypertension and repairable congenital cardiac defect should be treated with bilateral lung transplantation and surgical correction of the cardiac anomaly. </p><p>In contrast, great disparity exists among centers in regard to the lowest acceptable right and left ventricular ejection fraction for bilateral lung transplantation (particularly among patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension) and some centers prefer combined heart-lung transplantation if severe dysfunction exists. The cut-off values range from approximately 10 to 25 percent for right ventricular ejection fraction and 32 to 50 percent for left ventricular ejection fraction based on published reports; values below these thresholds may trigger consideration of heart-lung transplantation. <br/><br/>In addition, other factors such as patient age, the degree of tricuspid valve damage, dependence on inotropic support, and the presence of technical limitations (eg, pulmonary artery aneurysm) would influence the decision about the type of transplant surgery in individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Longer wait time for a suitable donor and potentially increased wait list mortality should always be considered when heart-lung transplantation is selected as the appropriate modality. </p><p>Heart-lung transplantation may be required in patients with end-stage parenchymal lung disease who have severely compromised left ventricular function (eg, sarcoidosis), or patients with unrelated concomitant severe lung disease and severe acquired heart disease not amenable to corrective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute and relative contraindications to combined heart-lung transplantation are similar to those for isolated heart or lung transplantation.

In the United States, both heart and lung matches are run simultaneously and if either the heart or lungs are allocated to a heart-lung transplant candidate, the patient will also be allocated the other organ provided there is no status 1A isolated heart candidate. The lung allocation scoring system has no equivalent to the status 1A listing by which cardiac recipients obtain the highest priority for allocation of donor hearts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;, section on 'Activity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults#H356089054\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'Waiting list and allocation'</a>.)</p><p>The lung allocation scoring system in the United States may not adequately reflect the severity of disease in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who are better served by the cardiac listing criteria. Thus, patients listed for combined heart-lung transplantation may be listed in some areas as a status 1A heart and obtain a heart and lung bloc via this mechanism. However, the criteria for 1A heart listing are not always applicable to patients with pulmonary hypertension or complex cyanotic congenital heart disease; as a result, an application for 1A status with exemption may be necessary.</p><p>In order to alleviate this problem, upon appeal, a modification of the lung allocation score can be made available for patients with pulmonary hypertension. Transplant candidates can receive an increase in their lung allocation score to the 90th percentile of all the allocation scores nationally at the time of request if they meet all of the following criteria: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deterioration on optimal therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right atrial pressure &gt;15 mmHg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac index &lt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup></span></p><p/><p>Additional impact on the lung allocation score can be obtained from total bilirubin (&gt;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and a &ge;50 percent increase of total bilirubin within six months (the latter exclusively for Group B patients, which includes candidates with pulmonary vascular disease). </p><p>Despite these difficulties, a study found that the incidence of transplantation increased and the wait-list mortality decreased in the post-lung allocation score era compared with the pre-lung allocation score period for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition, both heart-lung and lung transplantation were found to be predictive of survival in transplant candidates with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-lung-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173931786\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heart-lung transplantation procedure involves procurement of the heart-lung bloc from the donor (and transport to the transplant center where implantation will occur), explant of the heart and lungs of the recipient, and implant of the heart-lung bloc into the recipient.

There is no consensus regarding biopsy frequency.

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H357271857\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would&nbsp;like to thank Drs.
