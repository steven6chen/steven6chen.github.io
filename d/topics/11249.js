These models are developed using statistical methodologies that involve determining the effects of variables of interest (eg, demographic data, clinical data, and laboratory values) on specific outcomes such as death.</p><p>Several prognostic models are currently used in healthcare settings. Some focus on generalized health status such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation System (APACHE III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], while others are disease specific. Examples of the latter in the field of hepatology include models for predicting survival in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Two models that are used commonly in the care of patients with cirrhosis are the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the development, use, impact, refinements, and limitations of the MELD score, particularly with regard to its use in allocating organs for liver transplantation. Other issues related to the selection of patients for liver transplantation are discussed separately.

In patients with cirrhosis, an increasing MELD score is associated with increasing severity of hepatic dysfunction and increased three-month mortality risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77732 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Given its accuracy in predicting short-term survival among patients with cirrhosis, MELD was adopted by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in 2002 for prioritization of patients awaiting liver transplantation in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H938189995\" class=\"local\">'Adoption of MELD for organ allocation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;, section on 'Cirrhosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16431499\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of the MELD score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MELD was originally developed to predict three-month mortality following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement and was derived using data from a population of 231 patients with cirrhosis who underwent elective TIPS placement. The model was subsequently validated in an independent cohort of patients from the Netherlands undergoing TIPS placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The original model included serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, INR, and etiology of the liver disease (cholestatic or alcoholic versus other etiologies).</p><p>The etiology of liver disease was subsequently removed from the model because it posed difficulties such as how to categorize patients with multiple causes of liver disease. Modification of the MELD score by excluding etiology of liver disease did not significantly affect the model's accuracy in predicting three-month survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It has also been shown that the inclusion of portal hypertensive complications (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) in the MELD score does not substantially improve its predictive accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, this does not imply that these portal hypertensive complications are not associated with decreased survival, but rather that these complications are more likely to be associated with advanced liver disease as determined by the MELD score.</p><p>Since survival following TIPS is primarily determined by the severity of the underlying liver disease, and since MELD is an accurate predictor of survival after TIPS, it was hypothesized that the MELD score might be useful as a prognostic indicator in a broader range of patients with advanced liver disease who were not undergoing TIPS placement. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the MELD score was useful in predicting mortality in several groups of patients, including patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation, hospitalized patients with hepatic decompensation, ambulatory patients with non-cholestatic liver disease, patients with primary biliary cholangitis, and a historic cohort of unselected patients with cirrhosis seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester at a time when liver transplantation was not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16431598\"><span class=\"h2\">Calculating the MELD score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several online tools are available for calculating the MELD score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-model-of-endstage-liver-disease-meld-score-not-for-liver-transplantation-listing-purposes-not-appropriate-for-patients-under-age-12-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-model-of-endstage-liver-disease-meld-score-not-for-liver-transplantation-listing-purposes-not-appropriate-for-patients-under-age-12-years-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The MELD equation that has been used by for prioritizing allocation of deceased donor livers for transplantation is demonstrated below: </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MELD = 3.8*log<sub>e</sub>(serum bilirubin <span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL])</span> + 11.2*log<sub>e</sub>(INR) + 9.6*log<sub>e</sub>(serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL])</span> + 6.4</p></div></div><p/><p>With this model, scores can range from negative values to infinity. However, to avoid confusion, UNOS modified the MELD scoring system to eliminate negative values by setting to 1.0 any measured laboratory values that were less than 1.0. Thus, patients with the combination of an INR of &le;1, serum creatinine &le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and serum bilirubin &le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> will receive the minimum score of 6 MELD points. In addition, UNOS set an upper limit for the MELD score at 40 points. </p><p>In an effort to avoid an unfair advantage for patients with intrinsic renal disease, the maximum serum creatinine level was set to 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> which is also the value that is automatically assigned to patients who have received hemodialysis at least twice, or continuous venovenous hemodialysis for 24 hours, in the preceding week. There is currently no modification in the score for patients receiving anticoagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3970681814\"><span class=\"h3\">MELDNa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In January 2016, Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Policy 9.1 (MELD Score) was updated to include serum sodium as a factor in the calculation of the MELD score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/resources/allocation-calculators/meld-calculator/&amp;token=iRMJIIdlcCMEXBWgyUXhEj85JXUmTLBxW0uB0IuIJz7WR7PrHBxXi2mI3BwjTJvu4iYyowpPMNpkTBUTjvT81BphmAxTsPpJApITG494Mzc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1241\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The MELDNa score</a> can be calculated online. &#160;</p><p>Hyponatremia is a common problem in patients with advanced cirrhosis, and the severity of the hyponatremia is a marker of the severity of the cirrhosis. Serum sodium is a reflection of the vasodilatory state in cirrhosis and predicts waitlist mortality independent of the MELD score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There is a linear increase in mortality by 5 percent for each mmol decrease in serum sodium between 125 and 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Multiple studies have shown that the addition of serum sodium concentration improves the predictive accuracy of the MELD score in hyponatremic patients with low MELD scores who are awaiting liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-25</a>]. Addition of serum sodium to the MELD model elevates the transplant priority for about 12 percent of listed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Severe hyponatremia <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;125&nbsp;mmol/L)</span> may be a better predictor of mortality than MELDNa score amongst patients with refractory ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Predictor of adverse prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with low MELD score and hyponatremia benefit the most from the MELDNa based allocation system. For example, a patient with MELD score of 6 and serum sodium of 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> or less gets an additional 13 points as a result of severe hyponatremia. However, patients with serum Na 137 or higher or with a MELD score 39 or higher do not get any benefit from the change in allocation to the MELDNa score based policy. </p><p>If serum creatinine in the MELD equation is replaced by measured, not estimated, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum sodium is no longer independently predictive of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938186045\"><span class=\"h1\">APPLICATIONS OF THE MELD SCORE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary use of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is in prioritizing patients on the waitlist for deceased donor liver transplantation based on liver disease severity and short-term mortality risk. However, as described above, the MELD score also predicts mortality following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement and has been demonstrated to have predictive value for outcomes in patients with cirrhosis undergoing <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/model-end-stage-liver-disease/post-operative-mortality-risk-patients-cirrhosis&amp;token=vebGvRE0IQA2dd97aYSiQSpZetktJHn4SjZDkQ80vwbCeHC6iBeGq+TO0+wG4kJdQB/vyiKm8utl3242He+YjbURPs5AhpThInSycmtjPtrFpPZrXf1El9RPJgopmDQHsR5Lz4/NYMEKk8xfuRCCOg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1241\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">non-transplantation surgical procedures</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

MELD has also been adopted, or is under consideration for being adopted, by multiple countries and regions worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the United States, adoption of MELD, which serves as a marker of liver disease severity and mortality risk among patients awaiting liver transplantation, has been associated with decreased mortality among patients on the liver transplant waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H938189995\" class=\"local\">'Adoption of MELD for organ allocation'</a> below.)</p><p>It is important to note that under the current deceased donor liver allocation system, adult patients with acute liver failure (UNOS status 1A) are exempt from the MELD-based prioritization process. However, outside of the context of the UNOS allocation policy for status 1A patients, the MELD score may have some prognostic value in selected patients with acute liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1088773583\" class=\"local\">'MELD applications beyond organ allocation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18272574\"><span class=\"h3\">Organ allocation prior to MELD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1990s, as the number of patients listed for liver transplantation increased and the number of available deceased donor livers remained stable, the number of patients dying while awaiting transplantation rose linearly. The time spent on the waiting list became an important, albeit unintended, deciding factor in the deceased donor liver allocation process. However, it was demonstrated that time spent on the liver transplantation waiting list did not correlate with the risk of death while awaiting transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Due to increasing concerns regarding this disparity in liver allocation, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a mandate in 1998 that deceased donor livers for transplantation be prioritized in a more equitable manner, emphasizing the concept of transplanting the &quot;sickest first,&quot; and de-emphasizing the amount of time spent on the transplantation waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>In response to this mandate, UNOS initially adopted the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scoring system for its liver transplantation prioritization system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>). However, it soon became apparent that the CTP score was not sufficient to resolve the dominance of waiting time as a deciding factor. </p><p>The failure of the CTP score was due to several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The allocation system adopted by UNOS defined only three categories of disease severity in patients with cirrhosis (status 2A, 2B, and 3), with the minimal listing criterion for liver transplantation being a CTP score of at least 7. Patients with a CTP score of 7 to 9 were designated as status 3, while those with a CTP score of at least 10 were status 2B. Patients deemed to be at risk of dying within seven days were made status 2A. However, since there were only three categories, each category contained numerous patients and waiting time continued to be a major factor in the allocation process. Furthermore, determining whether a patient would die within seven days (ie, designated as status 2A) was not based on any validated criteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CTP score includes subjective parameters such as the degree of ascites and encephalopathy. The quantification of the degree of abnormality in these two findings may vary based on the observer and the method of detection used. In addition, the findings may be altered substantially by medical interventions (eg, the use of diuretics for ascites, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a> for encephalopathy). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CTP score is limited in its discriminatory capacity due to both a &quot;ceiling&quot; and a &quot;floor&quot; effect. A patient with a serum bilirubin level of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> for example, is assigned the same number of points as a patient with a bilirubin of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> even though the degree of elevation in serum bilirubin level is known to be an important prognostic indicator in patients with cirrhosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938189995\"><span class=\"h3\">Adoption of MELD for organ allocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the liver transplantation community's search for a more equitable allocation system, the MELD score emerged as a more objective model for prioritizing patients based on liver disease severity. The MELD score was adopted by UNOS in 2002 for use in deceased donor liver allocation for adults with cirrhosis. </p><p>The utility of the MELD score for predicting three-month mortality among patients awaiting liver transplantation was demonstrated in a study that included 3437 adult liver transplantation candidates who were listed between 1999 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of these, 412 died during the three-month follow-up period. Waiting list mortality was directly proportional to the MELD score at the time of listing, with mortality being 1.9 percent for patients with MELD scores less than 9, and 71 percent for patients with MELD scores &ge;40 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77732 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The use of MELD to predict whether undergoing liver transplantation would provide a survival benefit compared with continued medical management has been investigated in several studies. It has been demonstrated that survival benefit increases with increasing MELD score and that at lower MELD scores, recipient mortality risk during the first post-transplantation year is higher than for candidates who remain on the waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321076378\"><span class=\"h4\">Prioritization for liver transplantation based on MELD score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients awaiting liver transplantation are ranked according to their MELD score and stratified by blood type. Patients have their MELD scores updated and forwarded regularly to UNOS by the listing transplant center according to UNOS directives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. As a general rule, patients who are severely ill (higher MELD scores) will have their MELD scores updated more frequently than patients with less severe liver disease. Patients with a MELD score &ge;25, for example, have their scores updated every seven days. Patients may have their MELD score updated more often if they experience a decline in health status (manifested by a rise in their calculated MELD score). Due to the dynamic nature of cirrhosis, the MELD score may either increase or decrease while patients await liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;, section on 'Cirrhosis'</a>.)</p><p>Time spent on the liver transplantation waiting list at a given MELD score is used to break ties among patients with the same blood type. If a patient's MELD score increases (indicating worsening of liver disease severity), the waiting time clock is set to zero and restarted at the higher score. However, according to current UNOS policy, if a patient's MELD score goes down, the time accumulated at the higher MELD score is maintained and added to the time accumulated at the lower score.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16431878\"><span class=\"h4\">Standard MELD exceptions in liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some conditions associated with chronic liver disease that may result in impaired survival, but that are not directly accounted for in the MELD scoring system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Some of these conditions have been designated by the liver transplant community as &quot;standard MELD exceptions.&quot; Patients who meet specific disease-related criteria for standard MELD exceptions may be eligible for an upgrade in MELD points, with subsequent automatic upgrades every three months provided that the patients continue to meet the specific disease-related criteria. These standard MELD exceptions were developed in order to more accurately represent the patient's mortality risk while awaiting liver transplantation.

Whether patients receive exception points (or are candidates for transplant listing at all) depends on the extent of their HCC. Giving additional MELD points to patients with HCC initially led to a substantial increase in the proportion of listed patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Subsequently, the HCC exception point policy was modified to more accurately reflect the mortality risk due to HCC, and to not unduly favor patients with HCC relative to patients listed with their biologic MELD score.

The number of deaths decreased from 273 per 1000 patient-years at risk in 2005 to 173 per 1000 patient-years at risk in 2010. </p><p>There had been initial concern that adoption of the MELD scoring system might result in poorer post-liver transplant outcomes if livers were being allocated to patients who were &quot;too sick&quot; (those with high MELD scores). However, there was no significant change in early (three-month) patient or graft survival in Era 2 (post-MELD) in the United States compared with Era 1 (pre-MELD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

These data demonstrate that the MELD allocation system has been successful in de-emphasizing waiting time as a major factor in prioritizing patients for liver transplantation.

In the pre-MELD era, high-risk donor livers were typically used for patients in most urgent medical need of liver transplantation. However, it should also be noted that since the adoption of the MELD system for liver allocation, there has also been a national initiative to increase the use of high-risk donor livers in order to increase the number of available organs. As such, it is likely that the adoption of the MELD allocation system for prioritizing deceased donor livers for allocation is not the sole explanation for use of more DCD livers in patients with lower MELD scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women in the post-MELD era are more likely than men to die or become too ill for transplant, whereas in the pre-MELD era the likelihoods for men and women were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The precise reasons for this are not completely clear, but studies suggest that women may be somewhat disadvantaged in the MELD system due to their generally smaller body mass and, therefore, lower creatinine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. It is also likely that donor liver allocation to women is impacted by factors outside the purview of the MELD score, including matching of organ size to recipient body size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1088773583\"><span class=\"h2\">MELD applications beyond organ allocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MELD scoring system has prognostic value in a variety of other clinical settings and populations of patients with liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/5,14,29,30,33,34,59-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,29,30,33,34,59-65</a>], including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selecting patients for TIPS placement</strong> &mdash; The MELD score was developed initially to predict three-month survival among patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In a study that included 720 adult status 1A liver transplantation candidates, patients with acute liver failure (non-acetaminophen induced) had the poorest overall survival on the liver transplant waiting list. Increasing MELD score was highly correlated with decreased survival in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In one study, a higher MELD score was predictive of the development of acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy, but once acute liver failure developed, the MELD score was not a more accurate predictor of survival than either the King's College Criteria or the international normalized ratio (INR) alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, in a study of patients with acute liver failure due to hepatitis A virus infection, MELD was only moderately accurate in predicting mortality risk (c-statistic 0.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a study utilizing UNOS data, it was demonstrated that patients who were designated status 1A actually had a mortality rate that was similar to that in patients with cirrhosis who had biologic MELD scores ranging from 36 to 40. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that status 1A patients were actually at lower mortality risk compared with patients with cirrhosis with biologic MELD scores &gt;40.

Therefore, the relationship between MELD and survival in patients with acute liver failure is complex, and although some studies suggest that MELD may have some prognostic value in acute liver failure, there are likely other parameters that are important mortality predictors in this unique patient population.

Some of these conditions have been designated as &quot;standard MELD exceptions.&quot; Patients who meet specific disease-related criteria may be eligible for standard MELD exceptions and, as such, may receive an upgrade in MELD points. Standard MELD exceptions were developed by the liver transplantation community in an effort to more accurately represent certain groups of patients' mortality risk while awaiting liver transplantation.
