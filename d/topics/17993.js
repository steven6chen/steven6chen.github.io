Patients with malignancy are in a hypercoagulable state and are more likely to develop VTE during the course of their illness compared to those without malignancy. Thrombotic events are the second leading cause of death in cancer patients after death from cancer itself.</p><p>The treatment of VTE (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in patients with malignancy will be discussed here. The treatment of VTE in patients without malignancy, the pathogenesis and epidemiology, and prevention of VTE in patients with malignancy are discussed separately.

The goal of therapy is to prevent recurrence, extension, and embolism while minimizing the risk of bleeding. However, treatment of VTE in cancer is complicated due to higher than usual rates of recurrent VTE as well as a higher risk of bleeding with anticoagulation treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81646 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. </p><p>In general, the same options for initial (immediate) anticoagulation (low molecular weight [LMW] heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> [UFH]) and long-term anticoagulation (LMW heparin, vitamin K antagonists [VKAs], and direct oral anticoagulants [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>]) are similar for patients with cancer and without cancer. Provided renal function is normal (creatinine clearance &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> LMW heparin is preferred over UFH for initial therapy (up to 10 days); and LMW heparin is preferred over VKAs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) or direct oral anticoagulants for long-term anticoagulation (at minimum three months) beyond the initial period. (See <a href=\"#H32601414\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H32601482\" class=\"local\">'Long term therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>Evidence-based society guidelines have been issued in 2012 and 2016 by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and in 2013 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), for the management of acute VTE in patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. These and other guidelines are in general agreement with our recommendations as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulant therapy is warranted in all cancer patients with new or recurrent VTE. Untreated pulmonary embolism is associated with a mortality of 30 percent, usually due to recurrent embolism. If left untreated, symptomatic deep venous thrombosis carries a 50 percent risk of pulmonary embolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;, section on 'Proximal DVT'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults#H86226720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.) </p><p>It is unknown whether the same risk of death or recurrence applies to pulmonary embolism (PE) found incidentally on imaging during staging. One retrospective review of 59 patients with unsuspected PE discovered during routine staging for cancer, reported a high rate of symptoms consistent with PE (75 percent of cases) in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Despite the lack of data, we generally consider incidental PE as an indication for anticoagulation. This preference is based upon the higher than usual risk of recurrence as well as the high incidence of what appears to be symptomatic PE in cancer patients, when it is diagnosed incidentally. </p><p>The potential benefits of anticoagulation should always be weighed against the risks, especially in those with high risk of bleeding or with limited life expectancy. As for patients without cancer, the best anticoagulant is one that can most effectively prevent VTE recurrence while minimizing bleeding risk. (See <a href=\"#H32601414\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H32601482\" class=\"local\">'Long term therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H32601494\" class=\"local\">'Extended therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32601366\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulation for VTE should generally be avoided if there is active bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there are other contraindications to anticoagulant use (eg, recent surgery, pre-existing bleeding diathesis, platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL,</span> coagulopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. When anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated, one treatment option is the insertion of an inferior vena cava filter.

Compared to patients without malignancy, patients with malignancy have a higher incidence of major bleeding ranging from 6.5 to 18 percent that is not always explained by over anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for bleeding are similar to those in patients without cancer including older age (&gt;65 years), higher intensity anticoagulation and prior gastrointestinal bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F90440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90440 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Data are insufficient to support the routine use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> or newer oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors) for <strong>initial</strong> treatment of acute VTE in patients with cancer. UFH is preferred in those with renal dysfunction or those in whom a need to discontinue or reverse anticoagulation is anticipated. Factors that affect agent selection for initial anticoagulation in the general population, many of which may apply to patients with malignancy, are discussed separately.

The best evidence comes from a meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials in cancer patients receiving anticoagulation for VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Compared with UFH for the initial treatment of VTE, LMW heparin was associated with a small reduction in mortality at three months (relative risk [RR] 0.66; 95% CI 0.40-1.1) without an increased risk of bleeding. There was little change in the risk of recurrent VTE. The efficacy of LMW heparin in this population assumes normal renal function (creatinine clearance &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> and does not apply to patients with renal impairment. Another meta-analysis of 18 trials in ambulatory patients with cancer showed no effect of heparin on mortality at 12 months, although agents were not compared in this analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Best studied are the LMW heparin formulations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dalteparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dalteparin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinzaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinzaparin</a>.

Compared with enoxaparin, fondaparinux was associated with higher rates of recurrence (12.7 versus 5.5 percent) with no difference in bleeding. Thus, LMW heparin (enoxaparin, dalteparin, or tinzaparin) is preferred over both UFH and fondaparinux for the initial treatment of acute VTE in patients with cancer. </p><p>Trials have not directly compared the efficacy and safety of LMW heparin with newer oral agents for <strong>initial </strong>anticoagulation in cancer patients. Data to support the use of the direct oral anticoagulants as long-term therapies for VTE in patients with cancer are derived from large randomized studies that contained relatively small proportions of patients with cancer, the details of which are described elsewhere.
