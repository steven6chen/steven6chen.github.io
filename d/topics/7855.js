It can cause pain and swelling in the joints. At first, it tends to affect only one joint &ndash; most frequently the big toe. It happens in people who have too much uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a chemical that is produced when the body breaks down certain foods. Uric acid can form sharp needle-like crystals that build up in the joints and cause pain. Uric acid crystals can also form inside the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. These crystals can turn into &quot;kidney stones&quot; that can cause pain and problems with the flow of urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482925002\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of gout?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with gout get sudden &quot;flares&quot; or attacks of severe pain, most often the big toe, ankle, or knee. Often the joint also turns red and swells. Usually, only one joint is affected, but some people have pain in more than one joint. Gout flares tend to happen more often during the night.</p><p>The pain from gout can be extreme. The pain and swelling are worst at the beginning of a gout flare. The symptoms then get better within a few days to weeks. It is not clear how the body &quot;turns off&quot; a gout flare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482925009\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for gout?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To test you for gout, your doctor or nurse can take a sample of fluid from the joint that is in pain. If he or she finds typical gout crystals in the fluid, then you have gout. Even without checking fluid from a joint, the doctor or nurse might still strongly suspect gout if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have had pain and swelling in one joint, especially the joint at the base of the big toe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms completely go away between flares, at least when you first start having them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your blood tests show high levels of uric acid</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482925016\"><span class=\"h1\">How is gout treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few medicines that can reduce the pain and swelling caused by gout. When you find one that works for you, make sure to keep it on hand all the time. That way you can take it as soon you feel a flare starting. Gout medicines work best if you take them as soon as symptoms start.</p><p>The medicines used to treat gout flares include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>NSAIDs</strong> &ndash; This is a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">indomethacin</a> (brand name: Indocin). NSAIDs might not be safe for people with kidney or liver disease, or for people who have bleeding problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Colchicine</a> &ndash; This medicine helps with gout but it can also cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroids</strong> &ndash; Steroids can reduce swelling and pain. These steroids are not the kind that athletes take to build up muscle. Steroids can be taken as pills or as shots.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482925023\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there medicines to prevent gout flares?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are medicines that can reduce the chances of having future gout flares. Most people who have repeated or severe flares of gout need to take these medicines. In general, they all work by reducing the amount of uric acid in the blood. Examples of these medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">allopurinol</a> (brand names: Aloprim, Zyloprim), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">febuxostat</a> (brand name: Uloric), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">probenecid</a>. People with severe gout can also get a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegloticase-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pegloticase</a> (brand name: Krystexxa), which is given through a vein. This medicine can cause an allergic reaction in some people.</p><p>If you take one of the medicines to prevent gout, your doctor or nurse will want to make sure you use it safely. He or she might also want to check that your uric acid level gets low enough to dissolve the gout crystals. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Allopurinol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">febuxostat</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">probenecid</a> can actually increase gout flares when you first start taking them. To prevent these flares, your doctor or nurse might suggest that you take low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">colchicine</a> when you start the medicines. This will give the gout crystals time to dissolve, and that will put a stop to the flares over time. If you do have a gout flare, it's important to keep taking your daily medicines normally.</p><p>Your doctor will check your uric acid levels regularly. This is to make sure the medicines are working and you are taking the right dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482925030\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own to prevent gout flares?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are overweight, losing weight can help relieve gout.</p><p>It's not clear that following a specific diet plan will help with gout symptoms. But eating a balanced diet can help improve your overall health. It can also help you lose weight, if you are overweight.</p><p>In general, a healthy diet includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. You should also limit sugary drinks and alcohol, which can make gout flares worse.</p><p>Some people with gout also have other health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or obesity. If you have any of these issues, it's important to work with your doctor to manage them. This can help improve your overall health and might also help with your gout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482925037\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-pyrophosphate-deposition-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gout-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gout (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
