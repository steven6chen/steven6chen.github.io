The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72262 \">figure 1</a>). The pituitary gland has different cells in it that make different types of hormones. There are different types of pituitary adenomas, depending on which cells are involved.</p><p>Pituitary adenomas can cause problems in different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can make too much of a certain hormone.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can press on nearby tissues in the head, such as the nerves that go from the eye to the brain. This can cause vision problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They can press on other cells in the pituitary gland and keep those cells from making enough hormone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20131726\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a pituitary adenoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on the type of pituitary adenoma you have and how big it is.</p><p>Some pituitary adenomas, especially small ones, cause no symptoms. People find out they have it after their doctor does an imaging test of their brain for another reason. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>When pituitary adenomas cause symptoms, the symptoms can be from having abnormally high levels of hormones in the body. Depending on the hormone involved, this can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent or irregular monthly periods, and a milky discharge from the breasts (in women)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low sex drive or trouble getting an erection (in men)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;acromegaly&quot; &ndash; This is when some parts of the body (especially the hands, feet, and jaw) grow bigger than normal. This usually happens over a long time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;Cushing's syndrome&quot; &ndash; This condition can cause medical problems such as weight gain, high blood pressure, thin bones, and weak muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;hyperthyroidism&quot; &ndash; This can make people feel shaky, nervous, or tired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;gigantism&quot; (in children) &ndash; This condition causes children to grow very fast and taller than other children their age. Children with this condition sometimes have large heads.</p><p/><p>Symptoms can also happen if the pituitary adenoma grows big or presses on nearby tissues. These symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20131758\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests for a pituitary adenoma include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone tests &ndash; Your doctor will do blood and urine tests to measure the levels of different hormones in your body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test, called an MRI scan, of your brain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision tests &ndash; Your doctor might order tests to check your vision.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20131773\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a pituitary adenoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pituitary adenoma that is found by chance and causes no symptoms does not usually need treatment. But the doctor will monitor the growth over time by doing regular follow-up tests.</p><p>A large pituitary adenoma or a pituitary adenoma that causes symptoms usually needs treatment. Treatment depends on the type of pituitary adenoma you have, how big it is, and your symptoms.</p><p>The different treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Many pituitary adenomas are treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor makes a small cut in the back of the nose and then uses a special tool to take out the growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75464\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75464 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Medicines are used instead of surgery for some types of pituitary adenomas. The medicines can shrink the growths and lower the amount of hormones they make. But medicines do not work for all types of pituitary adenomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation &ndash; Radiation uses high doses of X-rays to destroy or shrink the growth. Doctors usually use radiation after surgery to keep a pituitary adenoma from growing back.</p><p/><p>After treatment, your doctor might do regular follow-up tests to monitor your pituitary adenoma and make sure it doesn't grow back. Some people also need long-term hormone treatment to correct the hormone levels in their body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20131811\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, you should talk with your doctor. Your doctor might want to treat your pituitary adenoma before you start trying to get pregnant. Plus, if you take medicines for your pituitary adenoma, your doctor will check that the medicines are safe to take during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20131826\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prolactinoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prolactinoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromegaly-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acromegaly (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cushings-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cushing's syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Growth hormone treatment in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cushings-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cushing's syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-prolactin-levels-and-prolactinomas-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High prolactin levels and prolactinomas (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromegaly-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acromegaly (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
