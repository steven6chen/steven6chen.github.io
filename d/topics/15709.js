The manifestations depend, in large part, upon the severity and chronicity of the phosphate depletion, with the plasma phosphate concentration usually being below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in symptomatic patients.</p><p>The major conditions associated with symptomatic hypophosphatemia are chronic alcoholism, intravenous hyperalimentation without phosphate supplementation, urinary phosphate-wasting syndromes (such as Fanconi syndrome or tumor-induced osteomalacia), and the chronic ingestion of antacids or other phosphate binders. Significant hypophosphatemia is also observed in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapies, yet the clinical relevance of this finding remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypophosphatemia in the alcoholic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Severe hypophosphatemia can also be seen during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and with prolonged hyperventilation; however, symptoms are unusual in these settings since the hypophosphatemia is acute and there is no preexisting chronic phosphate depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Phosphate depletion'</a>.)</p><p>Except for the effects on calcium and magnesium metabolism, the clinical manifestations of hypophosphatemia are primarily due to the consequences of <strong>intracellular phosphate depletion</strong>, which can affect many organ systems. The signs and symptoms of hypophosphatemia will be reviewed here. The diagnostic approach to and treatment of hypophosphatemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA ON MINERAL METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged hypophosphatemia produces a number of effects on both the kidney and bone. Distal tubular reabsorption of calcium and magnesium are inhibited, and striking hypercalciuria ensues. This response to phosphate depletion is dramatic, but the mechanism is unknown. A number of patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria have mild hypophosphatemia, and it has been suggested that impaired phosphate balance may be the primary abnormality, with enhanced calcium excretion representing a secondary effect.</p><p>The initial response of bone to hypophosphatemia is increased resorption; the associated release of bone calcium contributes to the hypercalciuria. This effect may be mediated, in part, by the phosphate depletion-induced rise in the synthesis of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>). More prolonged hypophosphatemia leads to rickets and osteomalacia due to decreased bone mineralization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16063123\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER EFFECTS OF PHOSPHATE DEPLETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the symptoms of hypophosphatemia are due to two consequences of intracellular phosphate depletion, which impact virtually all organ systems. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) levels fall, thereby increasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and reducing oxygen release at the tissue level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels fall with severe hypophosphatemia, and cell functions dependent upon energy-rich phosphate compounds begin to fail.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe hypophosphatemia can lead to a metabolic encephalopathy that results from ATP depletion. A broad spectrum of neurologic symptoms have been associated with prolonged phosphate depletion, ranging from mild irritability and paresthesias to more severe manifestations such as delirium, generalized seizures, and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. Severe phosphate depletion is also speculated to contribute to the development of central and extrapontine myelinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiopulmonary system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial contractility may be impaired with ATP depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and phosphate administration appears to improve cardiac function, especially in patients with severe hypophosphatemia, defined as a plasma phosphate below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, hypophosphatemia has been associated with a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and an increased requirement of vasoactive drug support following cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Pulmonary function is also impacted by prolonged hypophosphatemia. Diaphragmatic contractility can be substantially impaired in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and several studies suggest that hypophosphatemia is associated with prolonged ventilator dependency in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal and smooth muscle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypophosphatemia-induced manifestations of muscle dysfunction include a proximal myopathy (affecting skeletal muscle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], dysphagia, and ileus (affecting smooth muscle). In addition, acute hypophosphatemia superimposed upon preexisting severe phosphate depletion can lead to rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Although creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations are fairly common in hypophosphatemia, clinically significant rhabdomyolysis has been described almost exclusively in alcoholics and in patients receiving hyperalimentation without phosphate supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypophosphatemia in the alcoholic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The development of rhabdomyolysis with the associated release of phosphate from the damaged muscle cells has two clinical consequences: It may <strong>mask</strong> the underlying hypophosphatemia and may therefore protect against the development of other hypophosphatemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/signs-and-symptoms-of-hypophosphatemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].
