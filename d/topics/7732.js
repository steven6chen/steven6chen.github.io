Despite clinical differences between these types of mood episodes, for the purpose of treatment they are considered to be similar and thus treated with the same medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. For refractory mania, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1137967\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-line medications for geriatric mania and hypomania include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, based upon randomized trials in mixed-age adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>] and other studies in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/1,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-19</a>]. No published head-to-head trials have compared these drugs in the elderly. The specific choice is thus based upon other factors, including past response to medications, side effect profiles, comorbid general medical conditions, potential for drug-drug interactions, patient preference, and cost. As an example, lithium is frequently avoided in patients with renal disease, whereas first and second generation antipsychotics increase the risk of hyperglycemia in older diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Clinicians can generally expect that approximately 50 to 60 percent of patients will respond to a first-line treatment, based upon study results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/18,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; Lithium is usually started at 150 mg once or twice daily in elderly bipolar patients and increased every one to five days as tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The half-life of lithium increases to approximately 28 to 36 hours as patients get older; elderly patients thus generally require smaller doses to reach and maintain a steady serum level than do younger patients. Multiple treatment guidelines for older adults with bipolar disorder note that relatively low doses are frequently sufficient to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The target dose is determined by 12-hour serum trough levels that should be drawn five to seven days after each dose increase. Target doses greater than 900 to 1200 mg per day are rarely required, and some patients 80 years or older may have therapeutic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> levels with doses as low as 225 to 300 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A study of 56 geriatric bipolar patients who recovered from their mood episode with lithium found that the mean daily dose was 689 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Practice guidelines often recommend that clinicians dose lithium to achieve serum levels at the lower end of the therapeutic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; however, for partial responders, the dose should be increased to achieve higher levels within the therapeutic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Lithium serum concentrations and laboratory testing are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults and lithium: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The elderly are at greater risk for acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity than younger patients. Absorption of lithium is usually not changed by aging, but excretion is typically less in the elderly because the glomerular filtration rate is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, older patients generally have a low volume of lithium distribution caused by reductions in lean body mass and total body water. Lithium side effects observed in older bipolar patients include ataxia, tremor, cognitive impairment, gastrointestinal distress, weight gain, polyuria, polydipsia, peripheral edema, hypothyroidism, rash, and worsening of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional information about lithium toxicity and side effects is discussed separately.

Specific interactions of lithium with other medications may be determined by using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence of efficacy includes a review of four open-label studies (137 geriatric bipolar patients) that found mania improved in 66 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The dose is then increased every two to five days by increments equal to the starting dose, to reach the target dose of 5 to 15 mg per day.

In the subgroup of 59 older patients, symptoms improved significantly more with quetiapine (modal dose 550 mg per day) than placebo. This was consistent with the finding that quetiapine was superior to placebo in younger patients.

The dose is then increased to 25 mg twice daily for the next two weeks. Thereafter, the dose can be increased by 25 to 50 mg per day, one week at a time for each increase. This slow titration reduces the risk of serious and life-threatening skin rashes, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The target dose is usually 100 to 200 mg per day, taken in two divided doses. A study of 41 geriatric bipolar patients who recovered from their mood episode with lamotrigine found that the mean daily dose was 163 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> (mean daily dose 151 mg per day) includes a 12-week, open-label study in 57 geriatric patients with bipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-bipolar-disorder-acute-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

For geriatric patients, we suggest starting fluoxetine at 10 mg per day and increasing the dose by the same amount every four weeks, to a target dose of 20 mg per day. Possible side effects include sedation, insomnia, weight loss or weight gain, abnormal bleeding, bone loss, and fractures. Given its long half-life, fluoxetine should be used carefully in older adults.
