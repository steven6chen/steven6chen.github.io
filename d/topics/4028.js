SS may occur alone (primary form) or in association with a second well-defined rheumatic disease (secondary form). The most common disease associated with secondary SS is rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>In primary or secondary SS, decreased exocrine gland function leads to dry eye and dry mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, a wide variety of other disease manifestations can occur in SS. The clinical manifestations of SS are divided into the exocrine gland features and the extraglandular disease features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of exocrine gland disease in SS will be reviewed here. The extraglandular manifestations, the classification and diagnosis, and the treatment of both sicca and extraglandular manifestations are discussed separately.

The exocrine manifestations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry eye disease &ndash; The ocular symptoms of dry eyes are irritation, grittiness, and a foreign body sensation. Signs include diminished tear flow as measured by the Schirmer test, ocular surface staining with vital dyes, and increased tear osmolarity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivary hypofunction &ndash; The symptoms of oral dryness (termed &ldquo;xerostomia&rdquo;) in Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (SS) include difficulty swallowing dry food such as crackers without drinking liquids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51074\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51074 \">picture 1</a>). Signs of salivary hypofunction include lingual papillary atrophy and lobulation, dry lips, glassy appearance of the palatal oral mucosa, and absent sublingual salivary pooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Salivary hypofunction is associated with an increased rate of dental caries and periodontal complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53927\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53927 \">picture 2</a>) and often with a decrease in the sense of taste and a change in oral flora, including an increase in oral candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivary gland enlargement &ndash; The parotid, submandibular, and other salivary glands may be diffusely enlarged in SS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69831\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69831 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F112230\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112230 \">image 2</a>).

The pathogenesis of SS is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Briefly, the histologic features include extensive lymphocytic infiltration, accompanied by glandular and ductal atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79996\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79996 \">picture 3</a>). In the major salivary glands, lymphoepithelial lesions are common, defined by the presence of B cells infiltrating the ductal epithelium and associated ductal epithelial hyperplasia. Lymphoid follicles representing germinal center-like structures are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The histopathologic process in the major salivary glands is known as benign lymphoepithelial sialadenitis. In the minor salivary glands, multiple aggregates of periductal lymphocytes in areas of gland not affected by interstitial fibrosis, ductal dilatation, and acinar atrophy are characteristic. Lymphoepithelial lesions and germinal center-like structures are present in only a minority of these biopsies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4087078448\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective study of 80 patients with primary Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (SS) followed for a median of 7.5 years reported the following frequencies of clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of dry eye and dry mouth were present in all patients and the only disease manifestations in 31 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraglandular involvement occurred in 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma developed in 2.5 percent</p><p/><p>A series of different classification criteria have been used to define and characterize SS. Most information cited in this topic review regarding SS has relied upon the 2002 American European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, in 2016, a different set of criteria was jointly endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) that differ from the AECG criteria in several respects, including the exclusion of <span class=\"nowrap\">SSB/La</span> antibodies, salivary gland scintigraphy, and parotid sialography and the lack of a distinction between primary and secondary SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The 2016 criteria also facilitate SS classification for patients with an extraglandular manifestation (eg, renal tubular acidosis, peripheral neuropathy) but without symptoms of dry eye or mouth. Thus, differences in estimates of the frequency and severity of various clinical manifestations may be observed that depend upon the criteria used to identify the patients included in the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

The symptoms vary and are often worse in the evening. Affected patients may complain of a &ldquo;gritty&rdquo; or &ldquo;sandy&rdquo; feeling in their eyes rather than &ldquo;dryness.&rdquo; A paradoxical finding is that, despite profound ocular dryness, an inability to cry is not a common symptom.</p><p>Other symptoms include irritation, itching, photophobia, and the accumulation of thick, rope-like strands (mucus filaments) at the inner canthus. Mucus filaments are particularly present upon awakening.

This procedure is performed routinely on an outpatient basis. However, salivary gland biopsy is not necessary in all patients. Primary SS is often associated with autoantibodies directed against either the <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span> antigens. The combination of clinical features consistent with SS and the finding of <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> antibodies in high titer generally precludes the need for salivary gland biopsy.

SS occurs in primary and secondary forms. The major signs of exocrine gland involvement are dry eyes and dry mouth, caused by immune-mediated inflammation directed against the exocrine glands of the eye and mouth. Histologic features include extensive lymphocytic infiltration, with glandular and ductal atrophy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry eye, caused by a reduction in the aqueous component of tears, usually presents insidiously over a period of several years. Patients may complain of a &ldquo;gritty&rdquo; or &ldquo;sandy&rdquo; feeling in their eyes, especially at night, rather than &ldquo;dryness.&rdquo; Physical examination may include punctate conjunctival and corneal damage and evidence of reduced tear production. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dry eye'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry mouth symptoms result from chronic salivary hypofunction. Patients may also complain of dysphagia, adherence of food to buccal surfaces, problems with dentures, changes in taste, or an inability to eat dry food or to speak continuously for long periods. Chronic complications include dental caries and oral candidiasis. (See <a href=\"#H749855219\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and diagnostic features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2349901191\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2801192\" class=\"local\">'Oral candidiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivary gland enlargement may be either chronic or episodic, and glands are usually firm, diffuse, and nontender. It most often affects the parotid glands, but the submandibular glands may be similarly involved. A particularly hard or nodular gland may suggest a neoplasm. Lacrimal gland enlargement can also occur in SS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Salivary and lacrimal gland enlargement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal dryness with associated dyspareunia may be complicated by bacterial and candidal infections. Non-exocrine involvement may include interstitial cystitis, and menstrual abnormalities and endometriosis may occur. (See <a href=\"#H3651248\" class=\"local\">'Genitourinary manifestations in women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper airway involvement may cause recurrent nonallergic rhinitis and sinusitis and dry cough. (See <a href=\"#H3651256\" class=\"local\">'Upper airways'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1651249356\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Paul Creamer, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ramos-Casals M, Tzioufas AG, Font J.
