Although the prevalence and impact of respiratory depression due to opioids were at one time de-emphasized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], there is now a growing appreciation for the adverse effects of chronic opioid use, including increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Emerging data also suggest that there is an increased incidence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) with chronic opioid use, with possible negative consequences.</p><p>Given the relatively high prevalence of both obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic pain in the general population, clinicians are likely to encounter patients with pre-existing or undiagnosed OSA who are using opioids for chronic pain. Awareness of the sleep and respiratory effects of chronic opioid use is essential in the safe management of these patients.</p><p>The effects of chronic opioid use on sleep architecture and respiration during sleep, and the diagnosis and treatment of opioid-associated SDB are reviewed here. Acute opioid use and its impact on patients with OSA in the perioperative setting are discussed separately. The respiratory and other effects of acute opioid intoxication are also reviewed separately.

Acute opioid use causes more frequent shifts in sleep states, increased arousals from sleep, an increase in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 2 sleep, and reductions in total sleep time, amount of slow wave (stage N3) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With chronic opioid use, there is a tendency for the percent time spent in REM and slow wave sleep to normalize, but there is an increase in daytime sleepiness and reported fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Withdrawal from chronic opioid use may lead to insomnia, increased arousals from sleep, and rebound in REM and slow wave sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14082114\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The control of breathing during wakefulness is a complex interaction between central respiratory centers, central and peripheral chemoreceptors, and lung <span class=\"nowrap\">mechanical/stretch</span> receptors, with input from voluntary behaviors and environmental stimuli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During both wakefulness and REM sleep, control of breathing is primarily determined by the central respiratory centers and secondarily by metabolic controls of breathing, involving inputs from peripheral and central chemoreceptors that detect changes in carbon dioxide, oxygen levels, or pH. During NREM sleep, metabolic controls play an important role in respiration. </p><p>Variations in respiration occur during the course of normal sleep, many of which may be vulnerable to the effects of opioids.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During NREM sleep, breathing usually remains regular, with a small decrease in total minute ventilation related to a decrease in respiratory rate and a small increase in tidal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Respiratory drive in response to hypercapnia and activity in the accessory muscles of respiration are decreased, and activity in upper airway muscles is often reduced. This may increase upper airway resistance in normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], but is thought to play a more important role in those predisposed to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H175956463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Determinants of upper airway patency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During REM sleep, breathing is irregular, with breath-to-breath variations in tidal volume. There may be significant hypercapnia seen in some individuals during REM, and an increase in upper airway resistance with diminished upper airway dilator muscle tone may occur. Additionally, minute ventilation depends largely on the diaphragm alone, as the accessory muscles of respiration become partially atonic during REM sleep, whereas the diaphragm is spared.</p><p/><p>Acute and chronic administration of opioids may affect many of these processes during both wakefulness and sleep. Opioids decrease wake central respiratory drive, with a resultant decrease in tidal volume, respiratory rate, and minute ventilation. The central and peripheral responses to hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli are diminished during wakefulness. Acutely, opioid administration has also been associated with increased upper airway resistance and rigidity of accessory muscles of respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>During sleep, the combination of physiologic changes in respiration and chronic opioid use can lead to significant alterations and irregularity in breathing. The exact mechanism of central apneas associated with chronic opioid use is unknown but may be due in part to the respiratory instability that is caused by reduced hypercarbic ventilatory drive and increased hypoxemic ventilatory drive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>There are fewer data on the long-term impact of chronic opioid use on respiratory and ventilatory parameters during wakefulness, and more research is needed to determine whether any of the changes are persistent or clinically significant. Hypoxemia and hypercarbia during wakefulness have been observed in some chronic opioid users.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14082120\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is an umbrella term used to describe varying combinations of hypoventilation, obstructive apneas, central apneas, mixed apneas, and irregular breathing during sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Central sleep apnea (CSA) is the most common form of SDB in opioid users, although mixed patterns may occur and the quality of the data is limited. Most studies are small and consist of referral populations. In two studies that reported on the relative distribution of central versus obstructive apneas among chronic opioid users, CSA was four to six times more common than obstructive sleep apnea (60 versus 10 percent and 30 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>A systematic review on CSA and chronic opioid use identified eight studies comprising 560 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this review, the overall prevalence of SDB (defined as an apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &ge;5) ranged from 42 to 85 percent, with the highest estimate obtained in a cohort of patients specifically referred for evaluation of sleep apnea. The mean prevalence of CSA was 24 percent. In studies that reported the central sleep apnea index (CAI), the mean CAI ranged from 5 to 13 per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In a study of 50 patients on long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> maintenance therapy and matched controls, the mean AHI was significantly higher in patients on methadone (44 versus 30 per hour), and this was primarily due to an increase in central apneas (13 versus 2 per hour) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The severity of central apneas correlated in part with methadone levels in blood, awake arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) levels, concomitant antidepressant use, reduced ventilatory response to hypercapnia, increased ventilator response to hypoxemia, and widened awake alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1326603284\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in patients chronically using opioids are not well established but do not appear to overlap with classical risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (eg, advancing age, obesity, male gender).

Additionally, during sleep, 8 percent of patients exhibited hypoxemia not clearly related to apneas and hypopneas.</p><p>Irregular breathing patterns are particularly common during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In one study, ataxic breathing was present in 70 percent of 50 patients on chronic opioid therapy during NREM sleep, including 92 percent of patients taking a daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalent dose greater than 200 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Daytime symptoms of SDB are variable and often nonspecific. Patients may have no complaints or they may report daytime sleepiness and fatigue, which may also be attributed to underlying disease, opioid use, or other medications. Nighttime sleep disturbances may be reported by the patient or a bed partner, or not at all.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1326602870\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) among patients who use opioids is primarily a polysomnographic diagnosis, and disease severity is established based on a combination of polysomnogram (PSG) results and clinical symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1352630880\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection for polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of SDB in patients chronically using opioids requires a high index of suspicion and PSG, as there are few reliable symptoms during wakefulness, and central apneas or irregular breathing patterns during sleep may not be apparent to the patient or to a bed partner.</p><p>None of the available screening questionnaires for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been validated or shown to be useful in identifying SDB in patients who chronically use opioids, and no such instruments exist for detection of central sleep apnea (CSA) in the general population. Given this, patient selection for PSG is challenging. Adding to the uncertainty is the relative lack of outcome data in patients with opioid-associated SDB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H25136797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Screening questionnaires'</a>.)</p><p>Until more data are available to guide clinical decision making, we suggest using a combination of clinical symptoms of disturbed sleep (eg, excessive daytime sleepiness, reports of poor sleep quality, frequent arousals from sleep), known risk factors for CSA in patients who chronically use opioids (eg, high daily opioid dose), and high-risk comorbid conditions (eg, heart failure, respiratory disease) to select patients for PSG. In practice, there should be a low threshold to obtain PSG in any patient on chronic opioid therapy who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness or any symptom of disturbed sleep, particularly when the daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> dose equivalent is greater than 200 mg, as the pretest probability of SDB in this population is quite high. (See <a href=\"#H14082120\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1326603284\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>In-laboratory attended PSG is the test of choice in this setting. Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is not advised in cases of suspected opioid-related SDB, since the likelihood of central apneas is high and HSAT cannot reliably distinguish between obstructive and central apneas.

Therefore, lowering or eliminating the opioid dose should be considered first-line therapy, when possible. Consideration should be given to alternative non-opioid analgesics and other therapeutic pain control modalities.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1352630848\"><span class=\"h2\">Concomitant drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving opioids for chronic pain or those in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> maintenance programs may also use other prescription medications, including benzodiazepines and antidepressants, which can contribute to worsening hypoxemia and hypercarbia during sleep. In the setting of SDB, the doses of these medications should be reduced if possible when prescribed concomitantly with opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1326602926\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive airway pressure therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is scant direct evidence upon which to base treatment recommendations regarding PAP therapy for SDB in patients chronically using opioids. It is not entirely clear whether central apneas, in the absence of hypoxemia, have significant and long-term clinical effects in this patient population, and it is not known whether specific treatment of the central apneas will result in positive short- or long-term outcomes.</p><p>Treatment decisions must therefore be individualized based on disease severity, symptom severity, and patient willingness to accept PAP therapy. We typically suggest a trial of PAP therapy in patients with hypoxemia during sleep, those with moderate to severe SDB (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;15), and those with mild SDB (AHI 5 to 15) who also report poor sleep quality or nighttime sleep disturbances.</p><p>Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is an effective first-line therapy for OSA, its effectiveness in the setting of opioid-induced SDB is less encouraging. Several small studies have shown that CPAP therapy eliminates the obstructive events but has minimal effect on ataxic breathing and hypoxemia, and may even worsen the central apnea associated with chronic opioid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. Other PAP modalities such as rate-controlled bilevel PAP (BPAP) and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) may be more effective, but data are limited to small case series, and no trials have compared different modalities in patients with opioid-associated SDB. </p><p>A 2013 systematic review of various PAP modalities for treatment of opioid-associated CSA identified five studies totalling 127 patients and concluded that BPAP, with and without supplemental oxygen, eliminated central apneas in 62 percent of patients, and ASV was successful in 58 percent of participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. CPAP was mostly ineffective in eliminating central events. The presence of ataxic breathing predicted poor response to PAP in most studies. Subsequent to this review, two additional studies on ASV have been published. In one study, ASV was effective in eliminating central apneas and improving oxygenation in all 16 patients with opioid-associated SDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most patients continued to adhere to ASV therapy during a minimum of nine months follow-up. In another prospective study, CPAP improved but did not completely normalize overall AHI, central apneas, and hypopneas, whereas ASV was significantly more effective at reducing these parameters at three-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; neither study reported on patient symptoms or quality of life.</p><p>Of note, the SERVE-HF trial found that ASV increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with CSA and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (&le;45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Therefore, ASV should be avoided in the subset of patients with opioid-induced central apnea who have concomitant heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

The particular PAP mode prescribed is best determined during overnight attended (in-laboratory) polysomnography (PSG). Titration is typically started with CPAP and then switched to ASV or BPAP with a back-up rate to eliminate observed respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) and ensure adequate oxygenation. On occasion, a second night of PAP titration may be necessary.

In these patients, supplemental oxygen is typically administered along with PAP therapy in order to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;90 percent during sleep. Oxygen alone (without PAP therapy) is not adequate therapy for opioid-associated SDB.</p><p>The cause of persistent sleep-related hypoxemia in these patients is presumed to be hypoventilation due to the opioids themselves in most cases. Further evaluation may be indicated if there is clinical suspicion for underlying lung or cardiac disease or if hypoxemia is also present during wakefulness.</p><p>The risk of oxygen-induced hypercapnia in patients with opioid-induced SDB is unknown. Noninvasive carbon dioxide monitoring is not routinely performed during PSG in adults but may be used if there is clinical concern for hypoventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults#H86030375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;, section on 'Ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1352630962\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AND MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are started on positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy should be monitored by the prescribing clinician, typically a sleep physician, within the first few weeks of initiation of therapy and at minimum once more during the first year, then at least yearly thereafter. Adherence to therapy should be objectively documented at each visit.</p><p>Repeat polysomnography (PSG) should be considered if opioid medication dose is increased, if the patient reports new clinical symptoms or sleep disturbance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when PAP machine inquiry suggests residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;5 and suboptimal therapy.

However, a robust body of literature in the general population indicates that patients with SDB, in particular obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), are at increased risk for a range of adverse outcomes, including impaired daytime function, accidents, cardiovascular morbidity, metabolic dysregulation, and all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications and adverse outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>While more studies are needed, irregular or ataxic breathing has been shown to be a sensitive predictor of impending respiratory depression in adults and children, potentially explaining, at least in part, the increased mortality observed with chronic opioid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3195171088\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1326602816\" class=\"local\">'Effects of opioids on sleep and respiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes varying combinations of hypoventilation, obstructive and central apneas, mixed apneas, and irregular breathing patterns during sleep. The most common form of SDB associated with chronic opioid use is central sleep apnea (CSA), which is identified in approximately 25 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H14082120\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1326602863\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most consistently identified risk factors for SDB in patients who chronically use opioids are low to low-normal body mass index and daily dose of opioid, with a daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> dose equivalent &gt;200 mg associated with highest risk. (See <a href=\"#H1326603284\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of SDB requires a high index of suspicion and polysomnography (PSG), as there are few reliable symptoms during wakefulness, and central apneas during sleep may not be apparent to the patient or to a bed partner. PSG should be considered in any patient on chronic opioid therapy who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness or any symptom of disturbed sleep, particularly when the daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> dose equivalent is greater than 200 mg, as the pretest probability of SDB in this population is quite high. (See <a href=\"#H1326602870\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lowering or eliminating the opioid dose is the preferred first-line therapy, when possible. Concomitant drugs that may be contributing to SDB, such as benzodiazepines, should also be decreased or discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H1326602912\" class=\"local\">'Lowering the opioid dose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1352630848\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy has been used in the treatment of opioid-induced SDB with varying success, but there are no agreed upon criteria for use of PAP in this setting. We suggest a trial of PAP in patients who have hypoxemia during sleep, moderate to severe SDB (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;15), or mild SDB (AHI 5 to 15) with reports of poor sleep quality or nighttime sleep disturbances (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The decision to use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus rate controlled bilevel PAP (BPAP) or adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) should be individualized at the time of PAP titration. In-laboratory titration is recommended and close clinical follow-up is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H1326602926\" class=\"local\">'Positive airway pressure therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to PAP therapy, patients with significant hypoxemia during sleep (ie, persistent baseline oxygen saturation &lt;90 percent despite PAP therapy, desaturations not clearly associated with apneas and hypopneas) are generally treated with oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;90 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1352630873\" class=\"local\">'Supplemental oxygen'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-chronically-using-opioids/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">The use of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain.
