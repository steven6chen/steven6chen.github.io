The sequence data are far more informative if they can be correlated with functional information. This correlation is most readily accomplished through the use of model systems. Thus, it is best to consider the topics of genomics and model systems together.</p><p>This topic summarizes some of the most useful on-line sources of genomic information and analysis, and presents selected examples of the use of model systems to explore the relationship between genetic constitution and function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC CONCEPTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genome is the full complement of genetic information encoded on a complete, haploid set of chromosomes. The human DNA sequence, as defined by the genome project, represents a composite compiled by studying DNA obtained from many individuals. While these data include considerable information regarding sequence variation among individuals, inter-individual variation remains incompletely cataloged.</p><p>Efforts to define variation between individuals and to relate such variation to disease risk remain central tasks for human geneticists.</p><p>Much of this investigation is focused upon single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), sequence variations which occur roughly once in several hundred bases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The high density of SNPs and development of methods to efficiently screen for them allow use of SNPs to identify functional genes. Such genes contribute to a wide array of traits, including susceptibility to polygenic diseases and response to pharmaceutical agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Two complementary approaches are being pursued to accomplish the goal of relating gene composition to function, or genotype to phenotype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies seek to establish associations between genes and traits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional studies seek to elucidate the mechanisms by which sequence variation lead to phenotypic differences.</p><p/><p>Structural and functional conservation of the genome over the course of evolution makes genomics a fruitful approach to studying human physiology and pathology. Genes and their protein products are highly conserved. As an example, approximately 30 percent of human genes have an equivalent in yeast (ie, a homolog). The percentage of homologous genes increases as the evolutionary distance between humans and model organisms decreases. The genome sequence of man's closest relative, the chimpanzee, shares the highest degree of sequence conservation with the human genome, with only ~1.2 percent divergence in single nucleotide polymorphism.</p><p>Another type of evolutionary relationship is evident in the organization of the genome: groups of genes physically clustered together on one chromosome in one organism are more often clustered together in other divergent species (so-called syntenic conservation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENOME-BASED EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a gene mapping study that assesses evidence of association between genetic variants and heritable traits across the genome. The performance of GWAS is feasible because of the availability of dense SNP coverage across the human genome and genotyping platforms that allow one million genotypes to be assessed in a single experiment. Typical studies consist of genotyping hundreds of thousands of common SNPs, using DNA microarrays in large case-control populations, with the goal of identifying specific risk alleles that are more prevalent in cases than in controls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic association studies: Principles and applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GWAS investigations of at least 50 traits or diseases have been reported. While these studies have succeeded in identifying variants in linkage disequilibrium with clinical disorders, the contributions of the allele-specific effects have been only modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As an example, one study of stature identified three alleles affecting height, but the most powerful of these had an estimated effect size of less than half a centimeter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Several databases of GWAS investigations are available. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Online sources of genetic information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1319387918\"><span class=\"h2\">Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of gene expression within a tissue can be treated as a series of quantitative traits, analogous to stature. The expression of many genes can be measured simultaneously using microarrays. Either linkage mapping (expression quantitative trait loci mapping, eQTL mapping) or GWAS approaches can be used to map and identify sequence variants that account for differences in the levels of expression of specific genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Results from such studies can be used to prioritize variants (ie, SNPs) for possible functional impact on human disease. Variants that confer changes in gene expression are more likely to lead to phenotypic variation at the cellular or clinical level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342443302\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep sequencing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technical advances in DNA sequencing, assembly of sequencing reads, and statistical analysis of sequence data have dramatically reduced the cost of sequencing. This has enabled &quot;deep sequencing&quot; (also called &quot;next-generation sequencing&quot;) projects in which the whole exome (protein-encoding portion of the genome) or the whole genome is sequenced to seek biologically-significant sequence variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Deep sequencing studies have revealed the contribution of rare variants to disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In polygenic disorders, deep sequencing has the potential to account for the &quot;missing heritability&quot; that is encountered in GWAS designs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333009224\"><span class=\"h2\">RNA-seq</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in sequencing technology and statistical analysis have made it possible for many laboratories to sequence the mRNA of a sample, hence the name RNA-seq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This approach is now often preferred to gene expression arrays as a means of characterizing the transcriptome (set of expressed genes) of a sample. RNA-seq offers two important advantages over array-based methods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is better able to characterize alternative splicing as a regulatory mechanism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It provides absolute as well as relative quantification of gene expression</p><p/><p>Technical advances have also made it possible to undertake RNA-seq using single cells as samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoprecipitation techniques (ChIP on Chip, ChIP-Seq)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoprecipitation (IP), commonly used to identify protein-protein interactions, has more recently been used to identify protein-DNA interactions, including genome-wide binding patterns of transcription factors and other DNA-binding elements. Results from these studies can be used to map transcription factor binding sites to each of the genes whose expression they control and to define the functional noncoding regions of the genome sequence. Many such annotations are available through the <a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/&amp;token=ufMrPALdHsT7wurZejVHAmUjZNR9AdBHw41tISj6cis=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2903\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">UCSC Human Genome Browser</a>.</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is performed by immunoprecipitation (IP) of fragmented but unpurified DNA, using a transcription factor or other DNA binding protein as the target of the IP. Following the precipitation, the DNA is purified and assayed. Assays are performed genome-wide through the use of microarrays (&quot;gene chips,&quot; hence the term &quot;ChIP on Chip&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. ChIP-seq is a related methodology in which the immunoprecipitated DNA is sequenced instead of being hybridized to a microarray. This approach requires access to high-throughput sequencing and supporting bioinformatics resources. The resulting data constitute a map of the antigen DNA binding site. (See <a href=\"#H342443302\" class=\"local\">'Deep sequencing'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1432856769\"><span class=\"h2\">Epigenomics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An individual's genome is essentially constant across tissues, but the pattern of gene expression among tissues varies greatly. This observation points to the existence of regulatory mechanisms beyond DNA sequence variation. Transcriptional activity of a genomic region is determined in part by the methylation status of the DNA and how the DNA is packaged into chromatin, which in turn is dependent in part on the modification of histone proteins. These epigenetic modifications underlie tissue-specific differences in gene expression, X-chromosome inactivation, and imprinting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-epigenetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of epigenetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-glossary-of-terms#H832339165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics: Glossary of terms&quot;, section on 'X-inactivation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H1457606458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting)'</a>.)</p><p>DNA methylation can be measured on a genome-wide scale, and such experiments are routine in many laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a robust approach to identifying modified histones, enabling genome-wide assessment of specific histone modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunoprecipitation techniques (ChIP on Chip, ChIP-Seq)'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMPLES OF MODEL SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not comprehensive, a few examples of model systems are presented here to illustrate the use of appropriately chosen model systems to relate genetic and functional data. The goal is to highlight what kind of problem each system is best suited to address, and to show how model organisms can be used to gain insights into human health and disease.</p><p>Model systems allow investigators to relate raw DNA sequence data with functional information. Models are useful insofar as they offer the technical means to accomplish studies that could not be undertaken in human subjects; model organisms permit a host of functional studies that could never be undertaken in a clinical setting.</p><p>The value of model systems depends upon establishing a proper balance between the simplification they offer and the extent to which they mirror human physiology. These factors usually are inversely related.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prokaryocytes and yeast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prokaryotic and yeast models derive much of their value from the ability to investigate large experimental populations in search of rare individuals. This is achieved through use of standardized protocols for selecting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> screening for specific mutations. By selection, only individual organisms possessing a specific metabolic property survive to be examined. Screening employs identification of a specific metabolic property in some organisms that results in an easily scored difference, allowing such organisms to be reliably identified, isolated, and recovered for further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacteriophage lambda</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bacteriophage lambda model has advanced general understanding of transcriptional changes in response to environmental stimuli. Lambda is a temperate phage that can grow in either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle. This is manifested morphologically by production of turbid plaques, in which surviving infected bacteria are present. There are various lambda mutants that produce clear plaques in which survival of infected bacteria is much reduced, or behave aberrantly with regard to superinfection. These properties are understood at a detailed molecular level.</p><p>Interactions of human transcription factors with their cognate DNA response elements and the resulting modulation of transcription are more complex variations on the themes first defined in prokaryotes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Yeast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast, is one of the most fruitful model systems. Yeast have many properties that make them ideal model organisms: the possibility of targeted gene replacement, growth as both a haploid and a diploid organism, and an array of selection and screening schemes. An example of the application of these features was the recent report of the effects of systematic deletion of over 2000 yeast genes under a variety of growth conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A significant insight arising from studies in yeast is the discovery of the sirtuin family of proteins, now recognized as critical determinants of longevity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The ease of experimental manipulation in yeast makes this model system particularly useful for performing experiments in which many genotypes are screened for function. As an example, the yeast 2-hybrid system allows a systematic search for interactions among proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This strategy was applied in a study in which approximately 1000 interacting protein pairs were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Importantly, the method is not restricted to yeast proteins, so that interacting proteins from any species can be studied in yeast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Protein-protein interactions are important features of virtually every cellular process. At the most basic level, it is important to recall that protein function depends on each protein assuming its proper conformation during synthesis; misfolded proteins lose function. So-called &quot;chaperone&quot; proteins interact with nascent peptides to assist in their correct folding during protein synthesis. While nascent protein-chaperone interactions can be studied individually and in other models, the yeast model system is particularly well-suited to global functional analysis of these interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>This experimental strategy has been adapted to seek interactions between proteins from other organisms. As noted above, about one-third of human genes have yeast homologs and understanding of human biology has been greatly advanced by study of these in the more easily manipulated yeast system.</p><p>Data about yeast are readily available at the Saccharomyces genome database (<a href=\"http://www.yeastgenome.org/&amp;token=QXJx+JZ01uepj8UoHFMdGpVPiT0Fdf2PsaWv/NgLUxs2Tu8KrYl+LKIsnmYVaKgd&amp;TOPIC_ID=2903\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.yeastgenome.org</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nematode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is used extensively as a model system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-model-systems/abstract/32-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-40</a>].

Knowledge of variations in gene sequence is largely dependent on the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a variety of study designs. Gene function studies are enabled by the use of model systems. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Basic concepts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genome-based experimental designs include genome-wide association studies (GWAS), quantitative analysis of gene expression (eQTL analysis), and studies involving immunoprecipitation techniques. Although GWAS studies have identified multiple variants associated with clinical disorders, the physiologic effect of the GWAS-identified individual variant alleles has been relatively modest. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Genome-based experimental designs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple model systems, chosen appropriately for their unique properties, can give insight to the relationship between genetic composition and function within the species. The value of model systems depends upon establishing a proper balance between the simplification they offer and the extent to which they mirror human physiology.
