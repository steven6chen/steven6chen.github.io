Excess GH stimulates hepatic secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which causes most of the clinical manifestations of acromegaly. </p><p>The clinical diagnosis is often delayed because of the slow progression of the signs of acromegaly over a period of many years. GH excess that occurs before fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates in a child or adolescent is called pituitary gigantism and is discussed separately. </p><p>The diagnostic approach to acromegaly will be reviewed here. GH excess in children and adolescents and the causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment of acromegaly are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pituitary-gigantism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pituitary gigantism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acromegaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acromegaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109012597\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acromegaly has been considered to be a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in Europe of 30 to 70 individuals per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, current estimates are considerably higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In one report, seven new cases of acromegaly were identified among 6773 unselected adults in a primary care population who underwent plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) screening; this suggests a population prevalence as high as 1000 per million individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A similar uncontrolled IGF-1 screening study in over 2000 individuals with type 2 diabetes found a prevalence of approximately 480 per million individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109012735\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SUSPECT ACROMEGALY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acromegaly should be suspected in individuals who present with the typical clinical features of growth hormone (GH) excess, which include the enlargement during adulthood of the jaw (macrognathia), hands, and feet, which result in increasing shoe and glove size and the need to enlarge finger rings. The facial features become coarse, with enlargement of the nose and frontal bones as well as the jaw, and the upper incisors may become spread apart. Despite the prominence of these findings at the time of diagnosis, the rate of change is so slow that few patients seek care because their appearance had changed. Other features include cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, arthropathies, carpal tunnel syndrome, and problems directly related to the pituitary tumor size (headache, visual loss). </p><p>Given the rarity of the condition, there is questionable value in screening all patients with only sleep apnea, uncontrolled diabetes, arthropathy, or carpal tunnel syndrome, unless there is a clinical suspicion of the disorder. However, we do suggest testing in patients who have several of these associated conditions, even if they do not have the typical manifestations of acromegaly (eg, acral and facial features) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Jaw prognathism or new onset severe snoring or sleep apnea in a non-obese patient should alert the physician to the possibility of acromegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;, section on 'Effects of GH/IGF-1 excess'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis should also be considered when a pituitary mass is identified on an imaging study; 75 to 80 percent of somatotroph adenomas are macroadenomas at the time of diagnosis. Some patients may be asymptomatic in spite of raised GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630885017\"><span class=\"h2\">Trends in timing of diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, most patients had pituitary adenomas that caused visual field defects, but this is less common now, presumably because of increased awareness of the disease and earlier diagnosis. The percentage of patients with visual defects at presentation is now estimated to be approximately 6 percent, down from 15 to 25 percent in 1975 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86308002\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a patient is suspected to have acromegaly, the first step is biochemical testing to confirm the clinical diagnosis, followed by radiologic testing to determine the cause of the excess growth hormone (GH) secretion. The cause is a somatotroph adenoma of the pituitary in over 95 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73104 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Determining the source of excess GH'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239994417\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach, which is similar to that of the Endocrine Society, includes measurement of a serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration as the first step (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71636\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71636 \">algorithm 1</a>). A normal serum IGF-1 concentration is strong evidence that the patient does <strong>not</strong> have acromegaly. If the serum IGF-1 concentration is high (or equivocal), serum GH should be measured after oral glucose administration. Inadequate suppression of GH after a glucose load confirms the diagnosis of acromegaly. Once the presence of excess GH secretion is confirmed, the next step is pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Determining the source of excess GH'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis is a biochemical one and does <strong>not</strong> require the presence of typical phenotypic features <strong>or</strong> the presence of a pituitary tumor on MRI. Therefore, biochemical testing of anyone with a clinical picture suggestive of acromegaly, eg, pituitary tumor of any size, or signs and symptoms of acromegaly, is essential. (See <a href=\"#H109012735\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect acromegaly'</a> above.)</p><p>Both serum GH concentrations and IGF-1 concentrations are increased in virtually all patients with acromegaly. The increase in serum IGF-1 is often disproportionately greater than that in GH for two reasons: GH secretion fluctuates more, and GH stimulates the secretion of IGF-1-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), the major IGF-1 binding protein in serum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135819880\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum IGF-1 concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best <strong>single</strong> test for the diagnosis of acromegaly is measurement of serum IGF-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Unlike GH, serum IGF-1 concentrations do not vary from hour to hour according to food intake, exercise, or sleep, but instead reflect integrated GH secretion during the preceding day or longer. Serum IGF-1 concentrations are elevated in virtually all patients with acromegaly and provide excellent discrimination from normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A normal serum IGF-1 concentration is strong evidence that the patient does <strong>not</strong> have acromegaly. </p><p>The results must be interpreted, however, according to the patient's age. In normal subjects, serum IGF-1 concentrations are highest during puberty and decline gradually thereafter. Values are significantly lower in adults over the age of 60 years than in younger subjects. Thus, an apparently &quot;normal&quot; value in a patient aged 70 years may in fact be elevated.</p><p>In addition, there are a number of conditions that are associated with lower serum IGF-1 concentrations, including hypothyroidism, malnutrition, poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, liver failure, renal failure, and oral estrogen use. In these situations, it is possible that the diagnosis of acromegaly could be missed, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should also be performed if the disorder is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>A further caution is that values from one laboratory may not be comparable to those from another laboratory. A major cause of this finding is a difference in the calibration standards for the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>All patients with elevated age-adjusted IGF-1 levels should undergo testing for GH hypersecretion (eg, measurement of serum GH after oral glucose administration).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135819594\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral glucose tolerance test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most specific dynamic test for establishing the diagnosis of acromegaly is an OGTT. In normal subjects, serum GH concentrations fall to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or less within two hours after ingestion of 75 g glucose. In contrast, the post-glucose values are greater than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in over 85 percent of patients with acromegaly. OGTT is the gold standard for determining control of GH secretion after surgical treatment, but it does not appear to be useful in assessing biochemical control in patients receiving medical therapy with somatostatin analogs. In these patients, both basal and post-glucose GH levels are highly discordant with serum IGF-1 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>When performing an OGTT, we suggest measuring serum GH before and two hours after glucose administration; the criterion for the diagnosis is a GH concentration greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.</p><p>These results were obtained mainly with a radioimmunoassay method for the measurement of GH. If one of the newer, highly sensitive immunoradiometric or immunochemiluminescent GH assays is used, the serum GH concentration falls to less than 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> after oral glucose administration in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, the diagnosis of acromegaly can be made when the serum GH concentration remains above 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> using standard assays. More importantly, these more sensitive assays may give better discrimination between those with and without acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239994480\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations of random serum GH measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Random serum GH measurements are not useful for the diagnosis of acromegaly. GH secretion in normal subjects is pulsatile, diurnal, and stimulated by a variety of factors, including short-term fasting, exercise, stress, and sleep; in addition, GH clearance is rapid (plasma half-life of about 20 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As a result, serum GH concentrations fluctuate widely, ranging from less than 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (less than 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> using very sensitive assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]) during most of the day, to 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> before the next meal or after exercise, to as high as 20 or 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> at night or after vigorous exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Serum GH concentrations also may be high in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and malnutrition.</p><p>All patients with acromegaly have increased GH secretion. However, the random serum GH concentration is often in the range of 2 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> during much of the day, values that can be found in normal subjects. Unlike normal subjects, the patient's serum GH concentrations change little during the day or night, and in most patients do not change in response to stimuli such as food or exercise. Nevertheless, because of the variations in serum GH that occur in normal subjects and in patients with other disorders, a high value cannot be interpreted without knowing when the blood sample was obtained and something about the patient. To obviate these problems, it is best <strong>not</strong> to obtain random measurements of serum GH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135819600\"><span class=\"h3\">Other dynamic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rarely necessary, other dynamic tests can be done. An example of when these might be performed would be a patient in whom acromegaly is suspected clinically but whose IGF-1 and OGTT results are normal.</p><p>Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), in a dose of 500 mcg intravenously, raises serum GH concentrations by 50 percent or more in about one-half of patients with acromegaly, with peak values occurring at 20 to 30 minutes; serum GH does not rise in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Conversely, L-DOPA (500 mg orally) reduces serum GH concentrations by 50 percent or more in about one-half of patients with acromegaly, while it raises the GH concentration in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. TRH is unavailable in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135819606\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum IGFBP-3 concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because IGFBP-3 secretion is GH-dependent (as is IGF-1), serum IGFBP-3 concentrations are elevated in patients with acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There is, however, considerable overlap of these values with those in normal persons, thereby limiting the utility of this measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the source of excess GH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66552454\"><span class=\"h3\">Pituitary MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once GH hypersecretion has been confirmed, the next step is MRI of the pituitary because a somatotroph adenoma of the pituitary is by far the most common cause of acromegaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73104 \">table 1</a>). In one report of 39 patients undergoing pituitary MRI for suspected acromegaly, a mass was identified in 27 of the 39 (69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Pituitary tumors as small as 2 mm in diameter can be detected with this technique, and the dimensions and anatomic extent of the tumor can be accurately identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63948\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63948 \">image 1</a>); computed tomography is less sensitive. In about 75 percent of patients with somatotroph adenomas, the tumor is a macroadenoma (tumor diameter 10 mm or more), and the tumor may extend to the parasellar or suprasellar region. An occasional patient has an empty sella with the tumor situated within the normal pituitary tissue lining the sella turcica.</p><p>It is important to remember that MRI does not distinguish between functioning and nonfunctioning tumors; this distinction must be based upon biochemical studies. This is an important concern because approximately 10 to 20 percent of normal subjects have MRI or autopsy evidence of a pituitary microadenoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other rare causes of acromegaly include pituitary somatotroph carcinoma, hypothalamic tumor secreting growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), nonendocrine tumor secreting GHRH, ectopic secretion of GH by a nonendocrine tumor, and excess growth factor activity (acromegaloidism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>MRI of the head and pituitary should identify some of these other tumors. If the MRI is normal, abdominal and chest imaging should be performed to look for an ectopic source of hormone secretion, followed by catheterization studies in an attempt to demonstrate an arteriovenous gradient of either GH or GHRH in the region of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Ectopic GHRH secretion accounts for only 0.5 percent of cases of acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acromegaly/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Serum GHRH is the only specific marker for this disorder, and concentrations are usually quite elevated; special arrangements with a reliable laboratory must be made for this assay. Pituitary MRI often reveals a normal-sized or enlarged gland, but other patients appear to have an adenoma. GHRH should not be measured routinely but should be if a clearcut pituitary adenoma is not seen on MRI or postoperatively if histologic and immunocytochemical examination of the excised pituitary tissue reveals somatotroph hyperplasia rather than a somatotroph adenoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
