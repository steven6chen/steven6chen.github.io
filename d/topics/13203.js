These allergies tend to cause severe reactions and usually persist over time.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of peanut, tree nut, and seed allergies are presented in this topic review. Diagnosis and management of these allergies are discussed separately, as is treatment for food-induced anaphylaxis. General discussions of food allergy are presented separately in appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of peanut allergy is variable worldwide. The highest rates are seen in westernized countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, where the prevalence is approximately 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. However, rates are lower in other westernized countries such as France (0.3 to 0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], Denmark (0.2 to 0.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], and Israel (0.04 to 0.17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. Peanut allergy is rare in Asian countries, where peanut is often not found on the list of most common allergenic foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Regional dietary habits and pollen exposure may influence the epidemiology of allergy to legumes, such as peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/6,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18-20</a>].

The rate appears stable in other countries including Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Hypotheses regarding the apparent increase in prevalence of food allergies are discussed in detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p>Tree nuts and seeds are also common food allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/1,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24-28</a>]. Sesame and mustard are the most common seed allergies reported, but allergy to other seeds can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The reported prevalence of sesame seed allergy in France, based upon data from the national databank, was 2 percent in children and 5 percent in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, patient-reported food allergy typically exceeds challenge-proven symptomatic allergy. The prevalence of tree nut allergy was similar to that of peanut allergy in a general population survey in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Walnut was the most commonly reported tree nut allergy, followed by cashew and almond. </p><p>Coexisting food allergy is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Allergies to other foods'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nine major and minor allergenic proteins in peanut (<em>Arachis hypogaea</em>), designated Ara h 1 to 9, have been identified that are responsible for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/18,19,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,30,31</a>]. The dominant allergens in most populations are Ara h 1 to 3, which are vicilin, conglutin, and glycinin seed storage proteins, respectively. Ara h 4, 6, and 7 are also seed storage proteins. Ara h 4 is a nearly identical isoform of Ara h 3. Ara h 6 is highly homologous to Ara h 2, and Ara h 7 is also a conglutin.</p><p>Ara h 5, 8, and 9 are proteins that are associated with pollen-food allergy syndrome (oral allergy syndrome). Ara h 5 is a profilin, Ara h 8 is a Bet v 1 (a birch allergen) homologue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and Ara h 9 is a nonspecific lipid transfer protein similar to Pru p 3 (a peach allergen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Allergens in PFS'</a>.)</p><p>In the United States and United Kingdom populations, more than 90 percent of patients with peanut allergy have specific IgE to Ara h 1 and 2, and 45 to 95 percent have specific IgE to Ara h 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In contrast, specific IgE to Ara h 8 or 9 is more common in individuals with concomitant birch pollen or peach sensitization, especially in Northern and Southern Europe, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The presence of IgE antibodies to Ara h 2 is most closely associated with systemic reactions to peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies#H9556928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for pollen-related, plant-derived food allergies&quot;, section on 'Peanut'</a>.)</p><p>Tree nut and seed allergens are less well characterized than peanut allergens, although a number of tree nut and seed allergens have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. These allergens include pollen allergen homologues, such as Bet v 1-like proteins and profilins, and more stable allergens, such as seed storage proteins and some lipid transfer proteins. Issues of crossreactivity between allergens are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergens: Overview of clinical features and cross-reactivity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Allergies to other foods'</a> below.)</p><p>Allergy to peanut, tree nuts, and seeds can develop through primary sensitization to the food itself or through secondary sensitization via sensitization to cross-reactive allergens (eg, birch pollen). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Routes of allergen sensitization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Results from one study suggest that the development of atopic sensitization to peanut occurs after birth rather than in utero. T cell cytokine responses and antibody assays of peanut-specific IgE and immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) were investigated in a cohort of 200 high-risk infants at birth (cord blood) and at 6, 12, and 24 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Skin prick testing was also performed, although food challenges were not done, and data on parental peanut ingestion were not collected. No association was found between cord blood T cell reactivity and the subsequent postnatal IgE or skin test responses to peanut (presence or absence of peanut sensitization), whereas an increasingly strong association developed between these parameters beyond six months of age.</p><p>Several reasons have been proposed to explain why peanut (and possibly tree nuts and seeds) are more allergenic than other foods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seed storage proteins contain disulfide bonds that give these proteins high thermostability and resistance to extreme pH values. In addition, these proteins are often glycosylated, which further increases thermal and proteolytic stability. Ara h 1 in the glycosylated form can act as a T helper type 2 (Th2) adjuvant, activating dendritic cells to induce maturation and proliferation of Th2 cells, which promote IgE production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-features-of-food-allergens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular features of food allergens&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain factors involved in harvesting and processing may also make these foods more allergenic. A greater amount of Ara h 1 is found in larger, more mature peanut kernels and in peanuts dried or cured at higher temperatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. High-heat roasting leads to glycation reactions that increase protein stability and allergenicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Antigen form'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolized vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, can serve as adjuvants, increasing the immune response to antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Whipping or emulsifying peanut butter to prevent the oil from separating from the peanut solids brings more of the water-soluble protein into direct contact with the oil, potentially increasing the immunogenicity of peanut proteins ingested in this manner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-features-of-food-allergens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular features of food allergens&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The pathogenesis of non-IgE-mediated peanut, tree nut, and seed allergy is less clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PEANUT ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for the development of peanut allergy include a family or personal history of atopic disease, severe atopic dermatitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> egg allergy in young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and a family history of peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Peanut allergy is also associated with the use of skin care products containing crude peanut oil in young children with a history of atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and the degree of household peanut consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Other associations, which have been called into question, include maternal ingestion of the allergen during pregnancy and lactation and consumption of soy products in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Specific factors associated with increased risk of tree nut or seed allergy have not been elucidated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Siblings of children with peanut allergy are at increased risk of developing peanut allergy. In one study, the prevalence of peanut allergy in siblings of a child with peanut allergy was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. From a study of twins, 7 percent of fraternal twins shared peanut allergy, and there was 64 percent concordance among monozygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There is familial aggregation of sensitization (presence of specific immunoglobulin E [IgE]) to food allergens, including peanut, walnut, and sesame seed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18236026\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a case-control study, loss-of-function mutations in filaggrin were associated with oral food challenge-positive peanut allergy (odds ratio [OR] 5.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These findings were replicated in a different population (OR 1.9) in the same study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin care products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A British study found that the development of peanut allergy was associated with the use of skin care products that contain peanut protein, in the form of crude oil, in children with atopic dermatitis, particularly those with active eczematous rashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Only highly refined oils are used in skin preparations in the United States. These oils contain almost no detectable allergen. It is not known if there is an association with the use of refined peanut, tree nut, or seed oils in skin care products and the development of peanut allergy. Nor is it known whether there is a similar risk if these oils are applied to noninflamed skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of first exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of introduction of a food probably influences the development of allergy versus tolerance. Peanut allergy has more than doubled in young children in countries where delayed introduction of peanut until at least three years of age was recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. In addition, the rate of peanut allergy is lower in countries where peanuts are introduced at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/6,14,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,48</a>]. However, dietary advice was generally poorly followed in countries that recommended delayed introduction, so the impact of these recommendations is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One study noted that the age at first exposure in children who developed peanut allergy and age at initial reaction (19 and 21 months) were lower during the period in which delayed introduction was recommended compared with the age of exposure and allergy onset (22 and 24 months) in the period prior to those recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The Learning Early about Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial was the first randomized trial to show benefit of early introduction of a major food allergen, with earlier introduction of peanut at 4 to 11 months of age associated with a decreased risk of developing peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Introduction of highly allergenic foods is reviewed in greater detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Factors influencing sensitization or tolerance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introducing-highly-allergenic-foods-to-infants-and-children#H1119107636\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introducing highly allergenic foods to infants and children&quot;, section on 'Introduction in a high-risk population'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Soy consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consumption of soy formula or milk was associated with peanut allergy in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, a subsequent study confirmed the suspicion that this association was not causal, but was due to preferential use of soy <span class=\"nowrap\">formula/milk</span> in children who had a known or suspected allergy to cow's milk based upon personal and family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In addition, an increased risk of peanut allergy was not seen in infants fed soy formula in a randomized trial of soy versus extensively hydrolyzed formula in infants with cow's milk allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal ingestion of food allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between maternal ingestion of food allergens during pregnancy and lactation and the development of food allergies in offspring was suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], although whether there is a causal relationship is debated. One subsequent study noted that allergen-specific IgE in cord blood was maternal in origin and IgE specific for the same foods was not found in infant blood at six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Furthermore, findings from a murine model of peanut allergy suggest that ingestion of a low dose of peanut, compared with no peanut, during pregnancy and lactation lowers the risk of peanut allergy in the offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In addition, some hypothesize that sensitization occurs as a result of environmental exposure (eg, skin contact) as opposed to ingestion exposure, and the level of maternal consumption of peanut may rather be a marker for the level of environmental exposure in the household [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In a large cohort of infants at high risk for developing peanut allergy, a direct correlation was found between the amount of peanut ingested by the mother during pregnancy and the level of peanut-specific IgE in the offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, whether this reflects clinical reactivity to peanut remains to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-allergic-disease-maternal-diet-in-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of allergic disease: Maternal diet in pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Other risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that have been associated with increased risk of food allergy in general in observational studies include older maternal age, maternal dietary factors, higher parental levels of education and income, delivery via caesarean section, breastfeeding, vitamin supplementation, and use of antiulcer drugs. However, observational studies are prone to bias, and many of these factors may be confounders. These issues are reviewed in greater detail separately.

These reactions can range from mild symptoms isolated to the oropharynx to severe anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 1</a>). Peanut is also implicated as a trigger in non-IgE-mediated or mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated disorders, such as atopic dermatitis and occasionally eosinophilic esophagitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565153350\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of allergic reactions to peanut, tree nuts, or seeds are systemic. Symptoms can be isolated to a single organ system, most commonly the skin (eg, urticaria, angioedema), or involve multiple organ systems (anaphylaxis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. In one study of children, 89 percent of initial reactions to peanut or tree nuts involved the skin, one-half involved the respiratory tract, and one-third affected the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. One-half of all reactions involved two or more organ systems in this study. Similar findings are reported for sesame allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/14,28,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,28,58</a>].

Concomitant asthma and peanut allergy developing at a later age were associated with an increased risk of anaphylaxis in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-clinical-features/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].
