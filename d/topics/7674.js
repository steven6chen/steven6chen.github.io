It has been used extensively to treat severe manifestations of a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Examples include organ-threatening manifestations of rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), polyarteritis nodosa, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; Churg-Strauss syndrome), Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, primary angiitis of the central nervous system, and isolated vasculitic neuropathy.</p><p>It is a prodrug that is converted to its active form in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in other organs. It can be administered either orally or intravenously. Oral administration usually corresponds to daily dosing and intravenous use to intermittent dosing (eg, every two to four weeks), but some exceptions exist. For example, extremely ill patients who are unable to ingest medications orally may receive daily doses of CYC via the intravenous route at the same doses they would otherwise receive orally.</p><p>Although very effective, CYC has the potential for devastating toxicity both in the short and long term (even after the medication has been stopped). Concerns about such drug toxicity, especially malignancy, have restricted its use to patients with the most severe disease. Newer, short-term protocols using significantly reduced cumulative doses of CYC have reduced, but not eliminated, associated risks.</p><p>Two major aims govern the use of CYC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt control of the underlying disease, to limit the extent and severity of damage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuation of the medication as soon as possible and replacement with a less toxic alternative, to minimize the short- and long-term morbidity that often results from CYC itself</p><p/><p>The pharmacology, administration, and monitoring of both oral and intravenous CYC will be reviewed here. The mechanism of action of CYC and other alkylating agents and the general toxicity of these drugs are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General toxicity of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>). The use of CYC for the treatment of specific rheumatic diseases is also discussed elsewhere. (See treatment sections of disease-specific topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolism and excretion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (CYC) are important issues related to its toxicity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stability</strong> &ndash; CYC tablets should be stored in covered containers. Refrigeration is not necessary, although the drug may be unstable at temperatures exceeding 25&ordm;C.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For intravenous use, CYC powder is reconstituted in sterile or bacteriostatic water. Reconstituted solutions should be refrigerated and infused within six hours unless bacteriostatic water is used. Reconstituted solutions may then be mixed with 50 to 150 mL of 5 percent dextrose, 0.45 percent or 0.9 percent saline, or lactated Ringer's solution for infusion. CYC is inactive as administered, reducing the risk of inadvertent subcutaneous infiltration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absorption, metabolism, and distribution</strong> &ndash; Oral CYC is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. It is metabolized primarily in the liver to 4-hydroxy CYC and aldophosphamide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70026\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70026 \">figure 1</a>); the latter compound is then converted to the active metabolite phosphoramide mustard and the non-alkylating, bladder-toxic metabolite acrolein. The appearance of these metabolites is delayed after the initial administration. Acrolein can be found in the urine as long as 24 hours after CYC administration. The active metabolites are highly protein-bound and distributed to all tissues including brain and cerebrospinal fluid. The active metabolites are assumed to cross the placenta and are known to be present in breast milk in small amounts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Consequently, the dose of CYC should be adjusted according to the degree of renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. When using daily CYC, the authors adjust the dose based upon the patient's creatinine clearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60883 \">table 1</a>). When using intermittent CYC in patients with renal dysfunction, the dose should also be modified, although precise guidelines for dose reductions in this setting are not established. In a patient with advanced renal dysfunction, the initial dose of pulse CYC should not exceed 500 mg per square meter of body surface area (BSA). Subsequent doses can be adjusted based on the bone marrow response.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following conditions represent relative contraindications to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (CYC):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CYC, like other alkylating agents, is teratogenic and is generally contraindicated in pregnancy. In women of childbearing potential, highly effective contraception and appropriate pregnancy testing are indicated. In life-threatening circumstances, particularly in late pregnancy, use of CYC may be appropriate for severe disease when an effective and safer alternative is unavailable. Late pregnancy exposure to CYC may not increase the risk for adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The major cause of bladder toxicity is the exposure to the metabolite acrolein, which can appear in the urine for up to 24 hours after CYC administration. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p>The occurrence of hemorrhagic cystitis increases the risk of developing secondary bladder cancer and is considered a contraindication to further administration of CYC, particularly if alternative therapies are available. This common practice is not strongly evidence-based and it is arguable that, in the face of severely active disease with a remote history of hemorrhagic cystitis and no equally effective alternate therapy, use of pulse intravenous (but not daily oral) CYC may be reasonable.</p><p>The risk of bladder toxicity secondary to CYC use is discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General toxicity of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystitis-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystitis in patients with cancer&quot;</a>).

CYP2B6 is highly polymorphic; the effect of a specific drug interaction on CYC metabolite exposure may vary up to ten-fold in patients with low CYP2B6 expression relative to extensive metabolizers (ie, most patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An assessment for drugs that alter the pharmacokinetics or toxic effects of CYC must be considered prior to administration.</p><p>Examples of potentially significant CYC drug interactions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drugs that alter activity of hepatic enzymes</strong> &ndash; Drugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes including CYP2B6 (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, barbiturates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>) may accelerate the metabolism of CYC into its active metabolites and thus increase both the pharmacologic and toxic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Whenever possible, men and women interested in having children should meet with a reproductive endocrine and infertility specialist prior to therapy with CYC. Cryopreservation of ejaculated semen is usually the preferred fertility-preserving measure in men. Women may be offered cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes, although undergoing egg harvesting is often impractical in seriously ill patients. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists for ovarian suppression have been investigated as a fertility-preserving measure, but the efficacy of these medications remains controversial. For women who are acutely ill and cannot access, afford, or medically tolerate cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes, the authors use a GnRH agonist 10 to 14 days prior to the initial CYC dose. However, in many cases, patients require immediate treatment with CYC and the GnRH agonist is given 10 to 14 days prior to the subsequent CYC dose. The authors use either 3.75 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> monthly or 11.25 mg of leuprolide dosed every 12 weeks.

Gonadal failure is less common with intermittent dosing of CYC, but the risk of this complication remains substantial in older women of reproductive age.</p><p>The likelihood of these reproductive toxicities rises with increasing age of the patient (at least in women) and the cumulative dose of CYC received [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In breast cancer patients, cumulative doses of approximately 20 g of CYC for women in their twenties, 10 g CYC for women in their thirties, and 5 g for women in their forties were associated with a 50 percent risk of POI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

However, the rate of POI among women over 40 remains high, and the risk increases in women who have had multiple treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1114350966\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women must be counseled about the need for effective contraception during and for three to six months after cessation of CYC administration.

A retrospective study with over 1000 patients treated with CYC for rheumatic diseases found a similar incidence rate of 1 to 2 percent of hemorrhagic cystitis in patient groups concomitantly treated with or without Mesna [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The risk of hemorrhagic cystitis increased with higher cumulative CYC doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many clinicians do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesna</a> based on the probable lower dose of CYC used for rheumatic disease, and correspondingly lower risk of hemorrhagic cystitis. However, it is not always possible to identify patients prospectively who may require repeated treatments of CYC and who may receive a subsequently higher cumulative dose of CYC. Thus, our authors use Mesna in patients receiving intravenous CYC based on its favorable safety profile and potentially protective effect. Dosing regimens are described below. (See <a href=\"#H847292085\" class=\"local\">'Administration of oral CYC'</a> below and <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Administration of intermittent CYC'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occasionally, patients develop allergic rashes after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesna</a>, requiring its use to be discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In our experience, patients who develop allergic reactions after receiving Mesna and CYC are much more likely to have reacted to the Mesna rather than CYC, although allergic reactions to CYC have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use alternative agents to CYC (when possible) in patients who have urinary retention due to the likelihood of increased exposure to toxic metabolites, particularly with daily administration.

One of the principal reasons for using intermittent CYC is concern about the long-term complications of daily oral therapy. If administered over the same time period, daily oral dosing results in a several-fold higher cumulative dose of CYC than intermittent CYC. Moreover, with intermittent pulses (eg, monthly), the bladder is exposed to acrolein for only one or two days each cycle, rather than every day.</p><p>A detailed discussion of the dosing regimens for intravenous CYC are presented in the disease specific topics.

Studies of and guidelines for intermittent CYC administration in breast cancer and other malignancies support treatment according to total rather than ideal body weight and suggest that this practice does not increase the incidence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The authors use total rather than ideal body weight in calculating initial bolus CYC doses for patients who are obese, but they try not to include weight gained from fluid retention in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Since the ratio of ideal to actual body weight varies up to threefold in rheumatic disease patients, the choice of approach may have important implications.</p><p>Subsequent doses are further adjusted based upon the patient's response to therapy and the nadir of the white blood cell count, as described below. The nadir of the lymphocyte count is usually at day 7 and the granulocyte count at day 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Following careful monitoring of the patient's reaction to the initial dose, we routinely check complete blood counts (CBC) for the purpose of dose adjustment on day 10 as well as within a few days of the subsequent pulse of be sure there was no significant residual bone marrow suppression from the previous dose. Most pulse CYC protocols in lupus nephritis begin with biweekly pulses or six to seven monthly pulses for induction, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with another agent.

As described above, the authors typically calculate the BSA using dry weight for nephrotic patients and total body weight (rather than ideal body weight) for obese patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As a general rule to diminish the risk of toxicity, the initial dose of CYC should be reduced to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> BSA in patients who are at high risk for infection or older adults (eg, age greater than 70 years or if the estimated creatinine clearance is less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span>. Recommendations for dose adjustment in patients with more severe renal dysfunction are varied and not evidence-based. In the setting of renal failure, the extent of dose reduction may also be influenced by the acuteness and severity of the disease.

Alternatively the regimen used in the Euro-lupus trial for lupus nephritis noted above, which employs a fixed dose of 500 mg IV CYC every two weeks for six doses for induction of remission, is gaining wide acceptance because of the lower cumulative CYC dose (3 g), although efficacy in non-white patients remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Exceptions should be made for patients with heart failure or severe pulmonary hypertension (who may not tolerate the required pretreatment hydration well), those with severe nephrotic syndrome (who may be unable to maintain brisk urine outputs), and those who, for reasons of frailty, may tolerate even moderate nausea poorly. The aggressive use of diuretics and bladder irrigation through three-way Foley catheters are more feasible in inpatients. Even in the outpatient setting, however, intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesna</a> may be used to prevent toxicities commonly associated with CYC.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydration</strong> &ndash; Patients must be hydrated adequately before, during, and immediately after the intermittent CYC infusions. Patients receiving intermittent CYC in the outpatient setting should receive one liter of intravenous fluid (eg, 0.45 or 0.9 percent saline) over a two- to four-hour period before the infusion. The choice of fluid is dictated by the relative risks of salt loading worsening edema in patients with renal disease or incipient congestive heart failure versus the occasional occurrence of hyponatremia due to SIADH (<strong>s</strong>yndrome of <strong>i</strong>nappropriate <strong>a</strong>nti<strong>d</strong>iuretic <strong>h</strong>ormone secretion) after CYC administration. In our experience, using half normal saline is a reasonable compromise. CYC is usually infused over one hour. After the administration of CYC, all patients should be instructed to drink at least one liter of fluid every six to eight hours for 24 hours afterwards, and to void as frequently as possible.

In almost all regimens, the total dose of Mesna administered is equivalent to 100 percent of the total dose of intravenous CYC administered. The authors administer 20 percent of the total CYC dose intravenously 15 to 30 minutes before the first dose of CYC, and again three hours later. They then give 30 to 40 percent of the total CYC dose orally (because of reduced bioavailability) at six and nine hours after treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other regimens administer half the total <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesna</a> dose is given intravenously 30 minutes before the CYC infusion, and the other half of Mesna is given two hours after the CYC infusion (either intravenously or orally).

A CBC should be repeated a few days before the next treatment to document bone marrow recovery. If severe leukopenia occurs (ie, a total white cell count less than 3500 per mm<sup>3</sup> or an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1500 per mm<sup>3</sup>), the subsequent dose should be reduced as described above.

Some experts recommend that the initial dose should be adjusted based upon an approximation of the ideal body weight rather than the actual patient weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H847292085\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration of oral CYC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral CYC can be administered safely in the outpatient setting in stable patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydration</strong> &ndash; CYC tablets should be administered in the morning and the patient advised to drink liberal quantities of fluid throughout the day (eight 8-ounce glasses of water or 2 liters are recommended).

As an example, we repeat cell counts and differential every two weeks for as long as the patient is on CYC. Some clinicians may measure a CBC and differential every four weeks once patients have been on a stable dose of oral CYC. Total white blood cell counts of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">3500/mm<sup>3</sup></span> or an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1500/mm<sup>3</sup></span> should lead to dose reductions, because lower counts are associated with a markedly increased risk of opportunistic infection.

However, the total white blood cell count should be maintained above <span class=\"nowrap\">3500/mm<sup>3</sup></span> and the dose reduced or held if leukopenia occurs. The goal of treatment is clinical improvement, which usually occurs without needing to induce leukopenia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal function</strong> &ndash; Serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and electrolytes should also be measured every two to four weeks. Patients' underlying disease or other medications (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) may affect renal function adversely.

The presence of blood on dipstick should prompt a microscopic examination of the urine sediment. Hematuria may signal drug-induced cystitis, premalignant changes in the bladder epithelium, the development of frank bladder cancer, or the occurrence (or recurrence) of glomerulonephritis. In the absence of clinical findings that strongly suggest glomerulonephritis (eg, significant <span class=\"nowrap\">new/increasing</span> proteinuria, red blood cell casts, and a rising serum creatinine), cystoscopy should be performed promptly as the next test in the evaluation of hematuria. Failure to promptly evaluate significant hematuria can lead to future uncertainty as to whether hemorrhagic cystitis, a contraindication to further CYC administration, has occurred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Interpreting the presence of hematuria is clearly more difficult in patients with systemic lupus or vasculitis who have hematuria at baseline because of renal involvement.

However, there is inadequate evidence to determine the optimal approach to screening for bladder toxicity after CYC use.

It is a prodrug that is converted to its active form within the body and can be administered either orally or intravenously. Although very effective, CYC has the potential for devastating toxicity both in the short and long term. Two major aims in the use of CYC are prompt control of the underlying disease and discontinuation of the medication as soon as possible, replacing it with a less toxic alternative to minimize the short- and long-term morbidity that often results from CYC itself. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The metabolism and excretion of CYC are important issues related to its toxicity. Specific precautions are required to maintain the stability of the medication. Oral CYC is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, then metabolized in the liver and converted to the active metabolite phosphoramide mustard and the non-alkylating, bladder-toxic metabolite acrolein. The active metabolites are highly protein-bound and distributed to all tissues.

One of the principal reasons for using intermittent CYC is concern about the long-term complications of daily oral therapy. When compared with oral daily CYC, intermittent CYC regimens are associated with less cumulative CYC. Intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesna</a> may be used to prevent toxicities commonly associated with CYC. Selection of the initial dose of CYC for intravenous infusion is based upon estimated body surface area (BSA) expressed in square meters (m<sup>2</sup>) and is further adjusted for renal function. Subsequent intravenous doses are further adjusted based upon the patient's response to therapy and the nadir of the white blood cell count. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent (pulse) cyclophosphamide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily oral CYC remains an important treatment for life-threatening manifestations of systemic rheumatic diseases, but it has been replaced by the use of intermittent CYC. The daily dose should be modified in patients with diminished or improving renal function or on hemodialysis, with resistant disease, and in the setting of obesity. Regular and frequent laboratory evaluations are required to screen for bone marrow toxicity, monitor renal function, and avoid major drug-induced bladder complications. (See <a href=\"#H3076224134\" class=\"local\">'Daily oral cyclophosphamide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either daily or pulse dosing regimens can be used for patients on a mechanical ventilator or with a decreased level of consciousness to whom CYC is administered in the intensive care setting. Particular attention should be given to measures for bladder protection. (See <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Cyclophosphamide in the intensive care unit'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wiernik PH, Duncan JH.
