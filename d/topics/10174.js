Three filarial species cause lymphatic filariasis: <em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em>, <em>Brugia malayi</em>, and <em>Brugia timori</em>. Infections are transmitted by mosquito vectors; humans are definitive hosts. Lymphatic filariasis is a major cause of disfigurement and disability in endemic areas, leading to significant economic and psychosocial impact.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis will be reviewed here. The treatment and prevention of lymphatic filariasis (and other filarial infections, including onchocerciasis, loiasis, and mansonellosis) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphatic filariasis: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onchocerciasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onchocerciasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mansonella-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mansonella infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>W. bancrofti</em> occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, many of the Pacific islands, and focal areas of Latin America and the Caribbean (including Haiti). <em>B. malayi</em> occurs mainly in China, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and various Pacific islands. <em>B. timori</em> occurs on the Timor Island of Indonesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81417 \">figure 1</a>). Overall, approximately two-thirds of individuals infected with lymphatic filariasis are in Asia. The epidemiology of lymphatic filariasis is changing due to implementation of a global program of mass drug administration (MDA) to eliminate transmission. Not only has mapping of disease prevalence prior to MDA led to reclassification of some countries (Costa Rica, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago) as nonendemic, but more than 25 countries have been able to stop MDA due to interruption of transmission and some (including Togo, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands, Maldives, Niue, Tonga, and Vanuatu) appear to have eliminated transmission entirely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Despite a substantial decrease in cases of lymphatic filariasis worldwide (by 32 percent, to 44 million between 1990 and 2013) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], infection rates remain high in endemic areas that have not yet implemented MDA. Moreover, residual hotspots of transmission have been identified in some countries, including American Samoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and Ghana [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], after presumed interruption of transmission and cessation of MDA.</p><p>More than 90 percent of cases of lymphatic filariasis are due to <em>W. bancrofti</em>, while the remainder is due largely to <em>B. malayi</em>. Estimates suggest that as many as 36 million infected individuals are seriously incapacitated and disfigured by lymphatic filariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One study in India noted that patients with chronic filariasis lose around 29 days of work per year due to complications of infection, highlighting the considerable burden the disease places on individuals and on the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another study reported an estimated productivity loss due to lymphatic filariasis of 77 to 100 percent during attacks of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis, 10 to 26 percent for lymphedema, and 15 to 19 percent for hydrocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, data suggest that the prevalence of depressive illness is high, accounting for an estimated 5.09 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Lymphatic filariasis is likely first acquired in childhood; it has been suggested that as many as one-third of children are asymptomatically infected before age five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk of infection in childhood may be related to the maternal immune response during pregnancy. In one study of 159 Kenyan pregnant women with active <em>Wuchereria</em> infection, neonates lacking filarial-specific T cell responses in cord blood at birth had a 13-fold increased risk of developing childhood infection (compared with uninfected controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of microfilaremia in endemic communities increases with age. In endemic areas, most individuals have been exposed by the third or fourth decade of life. The burden of infection with adult worms increases with exposure over time. The adult worm does not replicate within the human host. Therefore, if an individual leaves an endemic area, the adult worm burden cannot increase, since exposure to infective larvae has ceased. Mosquito vectors are relatively inefficient transmission vectors of filariasis; therefore, a relatively prolonged stay in an endemic area is usually required for acquisition of infection.</p><p>The mosquito vectors for filariasis vary geographically. Mosquito vectors for <em>Wuchereria</em> include <em>Culex</em>, <em>Anopheles</em>, <em>Aedes</em>, <em>Mansonia</em>, and <em>Coquillettidia</em>; vectors for <em>Brugia</em> are typically <em>Mansonia</em> and <em>Aedes</em>. Both urban and rural transmission of disease occurs. In many tropical and subtropical areas, the prevalence of infection is increasing due to progressive urbanization and increased breeding sites for mosquito vectors.</p><p>Humans are the only hosts for Bancroftian filariasis; this is an important epidemiologic distinction for goals to suppress and eradicate lymphatic filariasis. In contrast, Brugian filariasis infects humans as well as domestic and wild animals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The life cycle of filariasis begins with introduction of third-stage filarial larvae onto human skin by a mosquito during a blood meal; subsequently, larvae migrate through the bite wound and enter local lymphatic vessels. Over a period of approximately nine months, these larvae develop into mature adult worms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74534\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74534 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52000\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52000 \">figure 3</a>). Female <em>Wuchereria </em>worms measure 80 to 100 mm in length and 0.24 to 0.30 mm in diameter, and the males measure about 40 mm by 0.1 mm. Female <em>Brugia</em> worms measure 43 to 55 mm in length by 130 to 170 microns in width, and males measure 13 to 23 mm in length by 70 to 80 microns in width.</p><p>The adults survive for approximately five years (occasionally up to 12 to 15 years). Male and female worms mate and produce sheathed microfilariae. <em>Wuchereria</em> microfilariae are 244 to 296 microns by 7.5 to 10 microns; <em>Brugia</em> microfilariae are 177 to 230 microns in length and 5 to 7 microns in width. The microfilariae migrate into lymph and enter the blood stream. A mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal. In the mosquito, the microfilariae develop into third-stage larvae, which can infect another human when the mosquito takes a blood meal, completing the life cycle.</p><p>In most of the world, microfilariae are present in the bloodstream only during the evening hours, with peak numbers between approximately 10 pm and 2 am (&quot;nocturnal periodicity&quot;). In the South Pacific, <em>W. bancrofti</em> microfilariae are &quot;subperiodic&quot; and are present in the blood at all times, with increased numbers at midday. The periodicity of the microfilariae corresponds to that of the vectors in the different regions.</p><p>The interval between acquisition of infective larvae from a mosquito bite and detection of microfilariae in the blood is the prepatent period. In general, this interval is approximately 12 months in duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis and clinical progression of filarial disease is likely influenced by a number of factors, including the extent and duration of exposure to infective insect bites, the quantity of accumulating adult worm antigen in the lymphatics, the host immune response, and the number of secondary bacterial and fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6728515\"><span class=\"h2\">Host immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical presentations among exposed individuals depend on a number of factors, including the host immune response; individual variations in immune responses are, in turn, related to a number of host and parasite factors. These include the timing of first exposure to parasites, the specific filarial pathogen involved, the intensity of exposure to infected mosquitoes, prenatal sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and other as yet uncharacterized host characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Genetic factors likely influence susceptibility to lymphedema as well as the presence and intensity of microfilaremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Paradoxically, clinical symptoms of lymphedema are often most severe among individuals without detectable microfilaremia, whereas infected individuals with detectable circulating microfilariae are most often asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Early in infection, filarial antigens provoke Th2-type immune responses, leading to production of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-5, and resulting in increased levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG4. Later in infection, immune responses to parasite antigens are downmodulated with suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation and impaired Th1 and Th2 cytokine production, likely contributing to the chronicity of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This immunosuppression is particularly marked in individuals with detectable circulating microfilariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and involves defects in antigen-presenting cell function and increased T regulatory cell numbers and activity. Effects on immune responses to concomitant infections and vaccine responses to irrelevant antigens have also been observed. Data suggest that qualitative and quantitative differences in filarial antigen-specific IgG4 may be associated with the development of chronic pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Living adult worms in the lymphatics can cause mechanical pathology but do not typically induce an inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. They may be responsible for the subclinical lymphangiectasia and lymphatic dilatation, both of which can be seen early in infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9440255\"><span class=\"h2\">Wolbachia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been recognized that the lymphatic filarial parasites contain endosymbiotic bacteria <em>Wolbachia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These are <em>Rickettsia</em>-like organisms that appear to be required for homeostasis of the host parasite.</p><p>Some of the inflammatory manifestations of lymphatic filariasis that result in progression of clinical disease are likely attributable to immune responses directed at <em>Wolbachia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25,26</a>]. Soluble extracts of many filarial species stimulate innate inflammatory responses, which are absent or reduced if the bacteria are absent or have been cleared with antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, acute and severe inflammatory responses have been observed in individuals with <em>Brugia malayi</em> infection when <em>Wolbachia</em> are released into the blood following death or damage of the worms after antifilarial chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphatic filariasis can be asymptomatic (subclinical) or associated with acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic clinical manifestations, including adenolymphangitis, filarial fevers, hydrocele, chronic lymphatic disease, and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Most infected residents of endemic areas are asymptomatic. However, subclinical manifestations can be demonstrated in many infected individuals; these include lymphatic dilatation, abnormalities in lymphatic drainage (demonstrable by lymphoscintigraphy), scrotal lymphangiectasia (observed on ultrasound), and microscopic hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nonetheless, estimates suggest that only about one-third of infected individuals in endemic areas will develop clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Travelers to endemic areas rarely develop chronic clinical manifestations but may present with acute symptoms.

Other nonspecific laboratory findings include elevated serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels and microscopic hematuria and proteinuria. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Renal involvement'</a> below.)</p><p>In one large cohort study of HIV infection in Tanzania, the risk of acquiring HIV was increased more than twofold in individuals with lymphatic filariasis (as defined by antigen positivity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute manifestations of lymphatic filariasis include acute adenolymphangitis, dermatolymphangioadenitis, filarial fever, and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute adenolymphangitis (ADL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute ADL characteristically presents with sudden onset of fever and painful lymphadenopathy. Retrograde lymphangitis (spread of inflammation distally from the lymph node) is frequently observed. ADL is believed to occur because of immune-mediated responses to dying adult worms.</p><p>A variety of anatomic sites may be involved; the inguinal lymph nodes and lower extremities are commonly involved sites. In general, acute inflammation tends to resolve after four to seven days. Recurrences typically occur one to four times per year; the number of recurrent events increases with increasing severity of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In Brugian filariasis, a single focal abscess may form along the inflamed lymphatics and ulcerate.</p><p>Acute lymphatic disease can also involve the genitalia; this is the most common manifestation in males with Bancroftian filariasis. Typical symptoms include painful epididymitis associated with fever and malaise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9440451\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (DLA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute DLA is a form of acute filarial disease that occurs in endemic areas. Characterized by edematous inflammatory plaques and systemic symptoms (fever, chills, myalgia, headache), DLA is thought to be caused by superficial bacterial infection of damaged skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A history of local trauma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> entry lesions, especially in the interdigital area, is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and recurrent episodes have been associated with progression of lymphedema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Filarial fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Filarial fever is characterized by acute, self-limited episodes of fever, often in the absence of lymphangitis or lymphadenopathy.

Involvement of inguinal lymph vessels leads to swelling of the lower limb(s). Involvement of axillary lymph nodes leads to swelling of the upper limb(s); in women, involvement of the breast can also occur. Early in the course of disease, pitting edema develops. Chronic inflammation leads to brawny nonpitting edema and hardening of the tissues, resulting in hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis. Severe lymphedema is sometimes referred to as elephantiasis. In Brugian infections, lymphedema is typically restricted to the distal extremities (below the knee or elbow), and genital involvement has not been reported in Brugian filariasis except in areas coendemic for <em>W. bancrofti</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic lymphatic disease can also involve the genitalia, resulting in the development of unilateral or bilateral hydrocele(s). Hydroceles can be large (up to or greater than 30 cm in diameter); they are usually painless unless complicated by bacterial infection. Localization of adult worms in the lymphatics of the spermatic cord can lead to palpable thickening of the cord. Lymphatic filariasis of the ovary and mesosalpinx has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of lymphedema includes malignancy, tuberculosis (and other infectious conditions associated with marked lymphadenopathy), recurrent cellulitis, and primary lymphedema. In patients from the tropics, podoconiosis must also be considered; it is an abnormal inflammatory reaction to mineral particles in certain soils that can result in lymphedema and elephantiasis. Podoconiosis occurs at altitudes higher than those at which mosquitoes can transmit filarial infection (a maximum of about 1500 meters, or 4920 feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In another study of 674 individuals from rural areas of Papua New Guinea, the Og4C3 CFA test detected twice as many cases as blood smear evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>False-positive <em>W. bancrofti</em> antigen test results are common in patients with large numbers of circulating <em>Loa loa</em> microfilariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. In addition, a negative antigen test cannot exclude filarial infection as a cause of chronic pathology since filarial antigens eventually become undetectable in treated or &quot;burned out&quot; infection, even in the setting of lymphatic damage.

Thus, ideally, blood should be drawn during this window. In the South Pacific, <em>W. bancrofti</em> microfilariae may be present even during daytime hours (subperiodic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]; there are also some subperiodic variants of Brugian filariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Microfilariae stain with Wright or Giemsa stains. Microfilarial levels in infected individuals from endemic areas can exceed 10,000 microfilariae per mL of blood, although lower levels are more common. As a result, infection may be missed on a routine thick smear, which typically contains approximately 20 microL of blood.

The majority of these assays are based on crude antigen mixtures; therefore, they do not differentiate between the various types of filarial infections and often cross-react with antigens from other helminths. Furthermore, since antibody tests cannot distinguish between active infection and past infection or exposure, they are useful primarily in detecting infection in travelers from nonendemic areas and have little predictive value in long-term residents of endemic areas. Although a negative test can help exclude recent infection, patients with chronic manifestations of lymphatic filariasis can become antibody negative over time.</p><p>Several assays based on recombinant antigens appear to have enhanced specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Three species cause lymphatic filariasis: <em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em>, <em>Brugia malayi</em>, and <em>Brugia timori</em>. Infection is transmitted by mosquito vectors; humans are definitive hosts. Lymphatic filariasis is a major cause of disfigurement and disability in endemic areas, leading to significant economic and psychosocial impact. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>W. bancrofti</em> occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, many of the Pacific islands, and focal areas of Latin America. <em>B. malayi</em> occurs mainly in China, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and various Pacific islands. <em>B. timori</em> occurs on the Timor Island of Indonesia. Despite the success of mass drug administration programs in reducing transmission in many endemic areas, the worldwide prevalence of infection in 2013 was estimated to be more than 40 million people. More than 90 percent of these infections are due to <em>W. bancrofti</em>; most of the remainder is due to <em>B. malayi</em>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The life cycle of filariasis begins with introduction of larvae onto human skin by a mosquito during a blood meal; these gain entry via the bite wound and enter local lymphatic vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74534\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74534 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52000\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52000 \">figure 3</a>). The larvae develop into mature adult worms, which mate and produce sheathed microfilariae with nocturnal periodicity. A mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal; these develop into larvae, which can infect another human when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal, completing the life cycle. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis and clinical progression of filarial disease is likely influenced by a number of factors, including the extent and duration of exposure to infective insect bites, the quantity of accumulating adult worm antigen in the lymphatics, the host immune response, and the number of secondary bacterial and fungal infections. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endemic areas, acute manifestations of lymphatic filariasis include acute adenolymphangitis, acute dermatolymphangioadenitis, filarial fever, and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Chronic manifestations of lymphatic filariasis include lymphedema, hydrocele, and renal involvement. Depression is common in the setting of chronic lymphedema. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travelers and expatriates usually have insufficient exposure to filariasis to develop the chronic complications of infection observed with high worm burdens. However, these individuals may demonstrate a hypersensitivity reaction to developing larvae, which rarely occurs among individuals in endemic areas. This is characterized by a local eosinophilic infiltrate with lymphangitis and lymphadenitis, urticaria, rash, and a peripheral eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Travelers and expatriates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis is based upon clinical and epidemiologic clues together with laboratory evaluation. The best laboratory tool for diagnosis of <em>W. bancrofti</em> infection is antigen testing, although false positives may occur in patients with <em>Loa loa</em>; examination of blood smears is a less sensitive but acceptable alternative in settings where antigen testing is not available. Definitive diagnosis of Brugian filariasis requires blood smear examination; serology can be helpful in appropriate clinical settings. Ultrasound can also be a useful diagnostic tool. Eosinophilia is common and may exceed <span class=\"nowrap\">3000/microL</span>.
