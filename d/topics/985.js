The evidence is based upon observational studies that can yield associations confounded by measured and residual (unmeasured) factors. These studies include retrospective case-control studies that carry the risk of recall bias, as well as population based registry studies, which may misclassify exposure. Other methodologic problems include incomplete assessment of maternal mental health, identifying depressed patients with screening questionnaires rather than structured clinical interviews, not assessing depression severity, not precisely defining outcomes, and grouping together different types of outcomes across a range of severity from mild to severe. Many studies use the mother&rsquo;s report for both the independent variable (prenatal depression) and dependent variable (child outcome), and depressed mothers may perceive their children in a more negative light than other informants (reporting bias). In addition, some studies fail to use appropriate control (comparison) groups, and some observed associations between exposure and outcome are based upon a small number of exposed and affected infants. </p><p>Associations between fetal exposure to antenatal depression and adverse outcomes that are found in observational studies may be confounded by many maternal factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-depression-risks-of-abnormal-infant-and-child-development/abstract/1-4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of depressive syndrome (eg, the antenatal depressive episode may have started prior to conception).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor adherence with prenatal care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid general medical illnesses (eg, obesity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid psychiatric illnesses (eg, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and substance use disorders).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribed medications, including psychotropics (eg, antidepressants, antipsychotics, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> benzodiazepines).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demographic and environmental factors, such as age, poor education, financial difficulties, social isolation, and intimate partner violence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal factors (eg, postpartum depression).</p><p/><p>The lack of knowledge about the effects of depression upon pregnancy outcomes and outcomes in the offspring complicates our ability to understand the effects of antidepressants upon pregnancy.

A prospective study included pregnant women with a high level of antenatal depressive symptoms (n &gt;400) and pregnant women with a low level of symptoms (n &gt;2600) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-depression-risks-of-abnormal-infant-and-child-development/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Their babies were assessed at age three to six months for excessive crying, which was defined as crying for an average of three or more hours per day in the past week. The analyses controlled for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age, parity, and exclusive breastfeeding), and found that excessive crying was more likely in the babies of mothers with a high level of depressive symptoms, compared with mothers with a low level (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1).
