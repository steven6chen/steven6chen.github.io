We believe it is reasonable to use the SYNTAX score to help guide decision making. However, no studies have shown that patients managed using this score have better outcomes than those who are not. (See <a href=\"#H166875754\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes based on lesion severity'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11251070\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to these patients is discussed separately.

Our approach to patients with LAD coronary artery disease is discussed separately. In general, we prefer PCI to CABG in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-significant-proximal-left-anterior-descending-coronary-artery-disease#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of significant proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease&quot;, section on 'Recommendations of others'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients with single vessel coronary artery disease, defined as at least one stenosis with &ge;70 percent diameter stenosis or a 50 to 70 percent diameter stenosis with a positive fractional flow reserve (&lt;0.80) in either the proximal or mid portion of the artery, we prefer percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for revascularization'</a> above.) </p><p>There are little data on which to formulate recommendations for patients with single vessel disease involving the right or circumflex coronary artery. Our preference for PCI is based on the absence of evidence to suggest outcomes are better with CABG. Also, CABG is associated with a higher rate of early stroke. Indirect evidence to support this recommendation comes from our preference for PCI in patients with single vessel disease of the LAD coronary artery. </p><p>Studies of morbidity and mortality associated with disease in each of the three coronary arteries are over 30 years old and therefore are not directly applicable to patients on current optimal medical therapy. Overall risk seems to be associated with the amount of territory in jeopardy and this is in line with the findings in population studies where the morbidity and mortality are highest for proximal LAD lesions, lowest for right coronary artery disease, and intermediate for non-proximal LAD and circumflex disease. However, in the individual patient, the right or circumflex coronary artery may be associated with a large left ventricular territory.</p><p>Patients for whom it is reasonable to prefer CABG include those with a large amount of potentially ischemic myocardium, those who are not candidates for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy, or those who have failed prior PCI. Patients with ischemic cardiac arrest and anatomically complex disease may also be considered for CABG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIVESSEL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, relatively well-preserved left ventricular systolic function, low complexity coronary anatomy, and no diabetes, we have a weak preference for CABG, as opposed to PCI. For these patients with complex anatomy (see <a href=\"#H166875754\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes based on lesion severity'</a> below) or diabetes, we have a strong preference for CABG. </p><p>The choice between CABG and PCI in patients with multivessel (two- and three-vessel) disease is influenced by a number of factors, including the number of vessels involved, the amount of myocardium supplied by the affected vessels, the anatomic complexity of the lesions requiring revascularization, likelihood of complete revascularization, patient comorbidities such as diabetes, and patient preference. At the time of decision making, the patient should be informed about the relative risks of death, stroke, and the need for repeat revascularization.</p><p>When the coronary anatomy is equally well suited for both PCI and CABG, the decision should be made jointly by the patient, referring physician, cardiologist, and a heart team or cardiothoracic surgeon. Attention must be paid to the patient's expectations and willingness to undergo repeat procedures, if necessary. Some patients remain fearful of open heart surgery with increased periprocedural morbidity and mortality and the ensuing 4- to 12-week convalescence, while others are unwilling to undergo repeat interventions if necessary. Other patients are strongly stroke averse and are willing to accept an increased risk of revascularization after PCI, in order to decrease the increased risk of stroke with CABG. The importance of clinical decision making after consideration of all of these factors should not be underestimated and cannot be easily replaced even by the best evidence from observational or randomized clinical trials.</p><p>Multivessel PCI should <strong>not</strong> be undertaken by low volume operators who have limited experience with complex coronary lesions. Furthermore, in high-risk situations, multivessel PCI may require two revascularization procedures performed at separate times (staged revascularization). Thus, the patient must be willing to return to the catheterization laboratory on several occasions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166875290\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes with CABG and DES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks of death, stroke, and the need for repeat revascularization are the most important outcomes in patients who require coronary revascularization with either CABG or PCI with drug eluting stents (DES). For most non-elderly patients, the most important deciding factor between the two is usually the relative rate of death. The studies presented below generally have combined end points and no single study was adequately powered to assess mortality. </p><p>In a 2018 pooled analysis of individual patient data from 11 randomized trials that compared PCI with CABG, five-year all-cause mortality among patients with multivessel disease (n = 7040) was higher with PCI (11.5 versus 8.9 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% 1.09-1.49) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Newer generation stents, including everolimus-eluting stents (EES), reduce the risks of death, MI, and stent thrombosis compared to bare metal and first generation stents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comparison of drug-eluting intracoronary stents&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>). </p><p>The BEST non-inferiority trial, which was terminated early due to slow enrollment, randomly assigned 880 patients with two and three vessel CAD to PCI with EES or CABG; patients with left main coronary disease were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

At 4.6 years, the primary end point occurred more often with PCI (15.2 versus 10.6 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.13). No differences were seen in the occurrence of a composite safety end point of death, MI, or stroke, but the rates of any repeat revascularization and spontaneous MI were significantly higher after PCI. </p><p>In an observational registry study of 34,819 patients with two and three vessel CAD (left main disease patients were excluded), 9223 patients who underwent multivessel PCI with EES were compared with 9223 patients who received CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There was a similar risk of death at 2.9 years (3.1 versus 2.9 percent per year; hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.17). Significantly higher risks of MI (1.9 versus 1.1 percent per year) and repeat revascularization (7.2 versus 3.1 percent) and a lower risk of stroke (0.7 versus 1.0 percent per year) were seen with EES. This difference in the risk of MI was seen only among patients with incomplete revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H891075663\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p>As noted in the studies above, both CABG and PCI are associated with a small but important risk of stroke and many of these studies suggest a higher risk in patients receiving CABG.

Trials comparing these older forms of revascularization are relevant to the extent that they can provide data on the outcomes that can be expected when they are chosen rather than CABG.

During longer-term follow-up (three and five years), CABG was associated with a mortality benefit in the complex SYNTAX score subgroup and lower major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event for both the intermediate and complex SYNTAX score subgroups. The difference in the lowest SYNTAX score subgroup (&le;22), however, was not significant and was related to a higher risk for repeat procedures for DES. Of note, more patients in the CABG group withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up, which should be considered in the overall interpretation of data. Other observational data also suggest that disease complexity is an important effect modifier, with similar outcomes for CABG and PCI in those with low-complex disease, and superiority for CABG in patients with more-complex disease. </p><p>Since the overall findings of the SYNTAX trial (which did not enroll patients with two vessel disease) favor CABG and as analyses by SYNTAX score and by individual end points were not prespecified in the SYNTAX trial, the finding of comparable outcomes in the subgroup with a low SYNTAX score must be interpreted with some caution. We are not confident that we know the optimal strategy in such patients. We suggest CABG for many of these patients, but some of our authors and reviewers frequently perform PCI, after discussing the pros and cons of both approaches with the patient. The risk of surgery, patient preference, technical difficulty for PCI, and compliance with dual antiplatelet therapy become especially important factors in this group.</p><p>One of the criticisms of the SYNTAX score has been that it does not include any clinical variables. In an attempt to improve the predictive capability of the SYNTAX score, the SYNTAX score II was developed using baseline patient data in the SYNTAX trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It contains eight predicators: the anatomical SYNTAX score, age, creatinine clearance, left ventricular ejection fraction, presence of unprotected left main CAD, peripheral artery disease, female sex, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The SYNTAX score II was externally validated using a large all comers (DELTA) registry of patients with three-vessel or complex CAD. The SYNTAX score II was better able to predict long-term mortality in patients with complex CAD than the angiographic SYNTAX score. While promising, further validation of this new score is needed before we recommend its use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1648704072\"><span class=\"h2\">Hybrid coronary revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hybrid coronary artery revascularization (HCR) refers to complete or near complete revascularization using the combination of single vessel CABG with the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) placed to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and PCI of other significant coronary lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Staged procedures were expected to be completed within six weeks of the first procedure. The rate of primary outcome of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (ie, death, stroke, MI, and repeat revascularization) within 12 months of the procedure was similar between the two groups after adjustment for baseline risk (0.142 versus 0.119 percent, respectively; hazard ratio 1.063; p = 0.80).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal therapy for patients with multivessel coronary disease with left ventricular dysfunction remains controversial and was not formally addressed in the large randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/revascularization-in-patients-with-stable-coronary-artery-disease-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-versus-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
