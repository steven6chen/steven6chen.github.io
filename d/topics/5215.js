Accurate detection of malaria is also important for epidemiological screening and surveillance to inform malaria control strategies, for research purposes in testing efficacy of antimalarial drugs and vaccines, and for blood bank screening.</p><p>Characteristics of a useful malaria diagnostic tool include the ability to definitively establish presence or absence of infection, determine which species of malaria <span class=\"nowrap\">is/are</span> present, quantify parasitemia (ie, parasites per microliter of blood or percent red blood cells infected), detect low-level parasitemia, and allow monitoring of response to antimalarial therapy (including detection of recrudescence or relapse). Thus far, there is no single malaria diagnostic tool that meets all of these criteria. Test characteristics that are important for diagnosis vary depending on the epidemiology of infection and goals for control in the region where the test is used.</p><p>Tools for diagnosis of malaria and the goals of malaria diagnosis in various settings will be reviewed here. Issues related to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention of malaria are presented separately.

In malaria-endemic areas with stable transmission and during high-transmission season in areas with seasonal malaria, malaria should also be suspected in children with palmar pallor or hemoglobin concentration &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p>The diagnosis of malaria is established in the setting of symptoms consistent with malaria and a positive malaria diagnostic test.</p><p>Individuals with acquired partial immunity due to repeated exposures in endemic settings may have asymptomatic parasitemia. There is no diagnostic test capable of distinguishing between parasitemia causing clinical malaria and febrile illness due to another cause in a patient who also has asymptomatic parasitemia. (See <a href=\"#H19723619\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516436200\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspected malaria should be confirmed with a parasitologic diagnosis whenever possible, as discussed in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6885923\" class=\"local\">'Parasite-based diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>If parasite-based diagnostic tools are not readily available and there is clinical suspicion for <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> infection, it may be reasonable to make a presumptive diagnosis with decision to initiate empiric therapy.

Smear examination via light microscopy is the standard tool for diagnosis of malaria; RDTs should be used if microscopy is not readily available. Molecular techniques for detection of genetic material are limited to research settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23056286\"><span class=\"h3\">Light microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of parasites on Giemsa-stained blood smears by light microscopy is the standard tool for diagnosis of malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In expert hands, the sensitivity of microscopy can be excellent, with detection of malaria parasites at densities as low as 4 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/mcL</span> of blood (approximately 0.0001 to 0.0005 percent parasitemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Diagnostic errors occur more commonly in the setting of low-density parasitemia (10 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/mcL</span> of blood), although errors can also occur with higher densities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4943905\" class=\"local\">'Parasite density monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Microscopy allows identification of the <em>Plasmodium</em> species as well as quantification of parasitemia. It also enables diagnosis of hematologic abnormalities and other infectious diseases such as filariasis, trypanosomiasis, babesiosis, and others.</p><p>Drawbacks to microscopy include that it is labor intensive and requires substantial training and expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>].

Capillary blood from a fingerprick (or earlobe or infant heelstick) or anticoagulated venous blood may be used. Smears should be prepared as soon as possible after blood collection to avoid alteration in parasite morphology and staining properties.</p><p>Two types of blood smears are used in malaria microscopy: thin and thick smears. Thin smear preparation maintains the integrity and morphology of erythrocytes so that parasites are visible within red blood cells. Thin smears allow identification of the infecting parasite species and can be used to measure parasite density. Thick smear preparation involves mechanical lysis of red blood cells so that malaria parasites can be visualized independent of cell structures. Thick smears allow the microscopist to review a relatively large quantity of blood and are typically used to screen for presence or absence of parasites and to estimate parasite density.</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has online guides for <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_procedures_benchaid.pdf&amp;token=jP9irApsPmydY/PyZ5WZo4GaiowtUiAjdZMZ3C9yc+H3BdkG2InFpKDhBWky4U5AczBYQyDbR1vZ5hKorwm04oodmzEvBOJDIiufS7q/tUUv21Kr2iRKERETFpthSsiA&amp;TOPIC_ID=5707\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">preparation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/resources/pdf/benchAids/malaria/Malaria_staining_benchaid.pdf&amp;token=OakZlLnjxZubL8zHgzJ7tY2nabqKECyKonBe2sbwjj2YPSFyjLaxJlBK1nWf1/xaTr/XLPfSm9LytXgQT2P6btasdEobAw/nZGfp78z8zvIcvyex4G8rTtbvc6MtVKOe&amp;TOPIC_ID=5707\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">staining</a> of blood smears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23056300\"><span class=\"h4\">Blood smear interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malaria parasites are best seen under 100x magnification using the oil immersion objective lens; smear evaluation should include examination of at least 200 to 500 fields or examination for 20 to 30 minutes. If malaria is suspected and the initial smear is negative, additional smears should be prepared and examined over the subsequent 48 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; the CDC recommends repeating a thick and thin smear every 12 to 24 hours for a total of three sets before ruling out malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Once a diagnosis of malaria has been established and treatment has been initiated, serial smears should be examined to monitor the parasitological response and ensure resolution of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>].

If fewer than 10 asexual parasites are counted per 200 white blood cells, counting should continue to a total of 500 white blood cells. Subsequently, the measured white blood cell count (in cells per microL) is divided by the number of white blood cells counted (200 or 500), and the result is multiplied by the number of parasites counted, giving the parasite density (parasites per microL). For example, a white blood cell count of <span class=\"nowrap\">8000/microL</span> divided by 200 white blood cells counted, times 500 parasites counted, gives a parasite density of 20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/microL</span>.</p><p>In a thin blood smear, the parasite density can be estimated by examining a monolayer of red blood cells (RBCs) using the oil immersion objective at 100x. The slide should be examined where the RBCs are more or less touching (approximately 400 RBCs per field). The parasite density can then be estimated from the percentage of infected RBCs; at least 500 RBCs should be counted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>An alternate expression of parasitemia is the percentage of erythrocytes that are parasitized. Taking the example above, the percent parasitemia is 20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/microL</span> divided by 4,000,000 (the average number of erythrocytes per microL in human blood), or 0.5 percent. As another example, a white blood cell count of <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL,</span> divided by 500 white blood cells counted, times 5 parasites counted, gives a parasite density of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/microL</span>. The percent parasitemia is 50 divided by 4,000,000, or 0.001 percent. Variation in white blood cell counts may confound estimates that use an average rather than a measured white blood count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Only asexual parasite forms are counted in calculating the parasite density. The presence of gametocytes alone indicates a recent infection (and potential for mosquitoes taking a blood meal to become infected) but not infection with actively replicating malaria parasites, which may cause symptoms. Because gametocytes are less susceptible than asexual parasites to many antimalarial drugs, persistence of gametocytes alone following treatment does not indicate drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In general, the higher the parasite density, the higher the likelihood of severe malaria; this is particularly true for individuals who do not have partial immunity (such as travelers from non-malarious areas and residents of areas with low malaria transmission). However, this association is not observed in all cases, and the relationship between parasite density, total parasite biomass, patient immunity, and severity of presenting symptoms remains to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The WHO definition of severe <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria includes hyperparasitemia (&gt;2 percent or 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/microL</span> in low-intensity transmission areas or &gt;5 percent or 250,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/microL</span> in areas of high stable malaria transmission intensity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The CDC definition of severe malaria includes parasitemia of &ge;5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is important to note that parasites frequently sequester in capillaries in the setting of severe malaria; therefore, the peripheral blood smear may reflect a low parasite density relative to the parasite burden present.</p><p><em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. ovale</em> infect only young erythrocytes, so parasite density for these species is typically lower; <em>P. falciparum, P. malariae,</em> and <em>P. knowlesi</em> infect mature erythrocytes and can therefore mount higher parasite densities. A parasitemia of &ge;5 percent is very unlikely with any species except <em>P. falciparum</em>.</p><p><em>P. knowlesi</em>, which may cause severe disease, may be indistinguishable by microscopy from <em>P. malariae</em> (which generally causes milder illness). Therefore, patients from knowlesi-endemic areas with microscopic diagnosis of <em>P. malariae</em> should receive parenteral therapy in the setting of parasitemia <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;20,000/microL</span> if no other testing for severe criteria is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-falciparum-malaria-plasmodium-knowlesi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-falciparum malaria: Plasmodium knowlesi&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Parasitemia should be monitored during treatment to confirm adequate response to therapy. The CDC recommends daily repeat blood smear to document declining parasite density until negative or until treatment day 7 (if discharged prior to complete parasitemia clearance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. During treatment of severe malaria, parasite density should be monitored every 12 hours during the first two to three days or until negative; some recommendations suggest switching from parenteral to oral therapy as tolerated after parasitemia falls below 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/23,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34,35</a>]. Parasite density may be expected to fall by 90 percent over the first 48 hours with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; clinical trials of artemisinin combination therapies typically result in median parasite clearance time &lt;72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], although prolonged parasite clearance times have been observed in areas of Southeast Asia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23056321\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RDTs for detection of malaria parasite antigens are increasingly important diagnostic tools in resource-limited endemic settings due to their accuracy and ease of use. They require no electricity or laboratory infrastructure, give results within 15 to 20 minutes, and can be performed successfully even by health workers with limited training. RDTs provide a qualitative result but cannot provide quantitative information regarding parasite density. RDTs that detect antibodies produced by an infected host are also available; however, these are less useful for diagnosing acute infection.</p><p>The approach to RDT selection depends on the epidemiology of infection and goals for control in the region where the test is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In regions where infection is primarily caused by <em>P. falciparum</em>, use of an assay that detects <em>P. falciparum</em> only may be sufficient and cost-effective. In regions where falciparum and non-falciparum parasites coexist or where <em>P. vivax</em> predominates, use of an RDT that can detect and distinguish between these species is warranted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88872 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4941987\"><span class=\"h4\">Antigen-based tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RDTs detect one or more of the following antigens: histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), <em>Plasmodium </em>lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), and aldolase. Depending on the target antigen(s), an RDT may identify <em>Plasmodium</em> genus only or may distinguish <em>P. falciparum</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>P. vivax</em> infections.</p><p>In general, for diagnosis of <em>P. falciparum</em>, RDTs that detect HRP2 are somewhat more sensitive than those that detect pLDH. For diagnosis of non-falciparum species, RDTs that detect pLDH and aldolase appear to be comparable.</p><p>Most antigen-detecting RDTs are based on immunochromatographic lateral flow technology; they consist of a nitrocellulose wick packaged as a dipstick, plastic cassette, or paper card (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88871\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88871 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/7,11,12,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12,39,40</a>]. One end of the test strip contains labeled antibodies and an agent to lyse red blood cells; a blood sample (5 to 20 mcL) and buffer are placed there, and the liquid migrates along the strip via capillary action, together with the labeled antibodies. The strip also contains a test line (bound antibody that binds parasite antigen, if present) and a control line (bound antibody that binds the migrating-labeled antibody to confirm adequate flow). The development time is typically 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4942001\"><span class=\"h5\">HRP2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histidine-rich protein 2 is part of a family of <em>P. falciparum </em>histidine-rich proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It is only produced by <em>P. falciparum</em>; therefore, use of HRP2-based RDTs is appropriate in regions where <em>P. falciparum</em> is the predominant species (eg, much of sub-Saharan Africa). Combination tests may be useful in areas endemic for multiple <em>Plasmodium</em> species.</p><p>HRP2-based RDTs can detect lower levels of parasitemia than RDTs based on other target antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-47</a>]. However, detectable HRP2 antigen may persist in the bloodstream for anywhere from a few days to several weeks after parasitemia is no longer present. In the absence of good quality confirmatory microscopy, there is currently no way to distinguish HRP2 antigenemia resulting from a new infection or persistent infection (ie, resulting from treatment failure) from antigenemia persisting from a recently treated infection. Some endemic countries' national guidelines therefore advise that a positive HRP2 result should be considered to represent a new infection only if the specimen was drawn 7 to 14 days or longer following a previously treated infection; however, it is recognized that this provides general guidance only and the duration of persistent antigenemia varies considerably among individual cases. Therefore, the usefulness of HRP2-based assays may be limited in areas of intense malaria transmission where positive results may occur as a result of prior infection. For the same reason, HRP2-based assays are not useful for monitoring following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>].</p><p>Variability in HRP2 gene sequence may affect test performance in some circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]; HRP2 diversity is not known to be a major cause of variation in RDT sensitivity but is a subject of ongoing study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. HRP2 gene deletions leading to false-negative RDT results have been identified in <em>P. falciparum</em> parasites from the Peruvian Amazon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]; therefore, HRP2-based tests are not reliable for infections contracted in this area.</p><p>Reports have emerged of <em>pfhrp2</em> and <em>pfhrp3</em> mutations or deletions in Africa and India leading to false-negative RDT results in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-malaria/abstract/60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-64</a>].

Parasite-based confirmation should be pursued whenever malaria is suspected clinically. Forms of parasite diagnosis include light microscopy (visualization of parasites in stained blood samples), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs; detecting antigen or antibody), and molecular techniques detecting parasite genetic material. (See <a href=\"#H2551512\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of parasites on Giemsa-stained blood smears by light microscopy is the standard tool for diagnosis of malaria; it allows identification of the <em>Plasmodium</em> species as well as quantification of parasitemia. However, microscopy cannot reliably detect very low parasitemia (&lt;5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/mcL);</span> it is also labor intensive and requires substantial training and expertise. Issues related to smear preparation and interpretation are discussed in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H23056286\" class=\"local\">'Light microscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid diagnostic tests for detection of malaria parasite antigens are becoming increasingly important diagnostic tools in resource-limited endemic settings due to their accuracy and ease of use. They require no electricity or laboratory infrastructure, give results within 15 to 20 minutes, and can be performed successfully even by health workers with limited training. RDTs provide a qualitative result but cannot provide quantitative information regarding parasite density. (See <a href=\"#H23056321\" class=\"local\">'Rapid diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to RDT selection depends on the epidemiology of infection and goals for control in the region where the test is used. In regions where infection is primarily caused by <em>P. falciparum</em>, use of an assay that detects <em>P. falciparum</em> only may be sufficient and cost-effective. In regions where falciparum and non-falciparum parasites coexist or where <em>P. vivax</em> predominates, use of an RDT that can detect and distinguish between these species is warranted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88872 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23056321\" class=\"local\">'Rapid diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RDTs detect one or more of the following antigens: histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), <em>Plasmodium </em>lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), and aldolase. In general, for diagnosis of <em>P. falciparum</em>, RDTs that detect HRP2 are more sensitive than those that detect pLDH. For diagnosis of non-falciparum species, RDTs that detect pLDH and aldolase appear to be comparable. (See <a href=\"#H4941987\" class=\"local\">'Antigen-based tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of molecular tests for malaria detection is generally limited to reference laboratories and is primarily for research and epidemiologic purposes.
