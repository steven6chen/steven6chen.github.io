Doctors are not sure what causes vitiligo, but they suspect it is caused by an autoimmune response. That is when the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system,&quot; attacks healthy cells. In this case, the affected cells are the ones that give skin its color.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4982982\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vitiligo?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is skin that turns white or loses its color. But which areas of skin are affected depends on the type of vitiligo a person has.</p><p>There are a few different types of vitiligo. The most common type is called &quot;generalized vitiligo&quot; or &quot;vitiligo vulgaris.&quot; But there are others, including &quot;acrofacial vitiligo&quot; and &quot;segmental vitiligo.&quot;</p><p>Generalized vitiligo usually affects both the left and right sides of the body the same way (symmetrically). It tends to affect:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingers, toes, ears, or other body parts that are far from the center of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F90319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90319 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin surrounding openings in the body, such as the mouth, eyes, and nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretchy parts of skin, such as the skin covering the elbows, knees, or finger joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parts of skin that are injured or get rubbed a lot, such as the skin under shoulder straps, waistbands, and collar areas</p><p/><p>Acrofacial vitiligo affects only the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingers, toes, ears, or other body parts that are far from the center of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin surrounding openings in the body such as the mouth, eyes, and nose</p><p/><p>Segmental vitiligo might affect only the left or the right side of the body in splotches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F90320\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90320 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4983012\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you develop patches of white skin, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4983025\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Vitiligo often happens along with other autoimmune problems, so your doctor or nurse might order blood tests to check for those other problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4983038\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vitiligo treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments help return normal color to the skin. The options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroid medicines</strong> &ndash; These medicines come in ointments, creams, or gels. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluticasone</a> (brand name: Cutivate) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mometasone</a> (brand name: Elocon).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcineurin inhibitors</strong> &ndash; These medicines come in ointments or creams. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pimecrolimus</a> (brand name: Elidel) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tacrolimus</a> (brand name: Protopic).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Light therapy</strong> &ndash; During light therapy, your skin is exposed to a special kind of light called &quot;ultraviolet light&quot; (also called &quot;UV&quot; light). This therapy is usually done in a doctor's office. Depending on the type of light therapy you have, you might take a medicine capsule before you have the therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4983051\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Do your best to avoid getting a sunburn or suntan. Otherwise the spots of skin that lack color will look even more different from your healthy skin. To protect yourself from the sun:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay out of the sun in the middle of the day (from 10 AM to 4 PM), when the sun's light is strongest</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay under a sun umbrella, tree, or other shady spot</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear sunscreen &ndash; Put sunscreen on all parts of your body that are not covered by clothes. Then reapply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours, or after you sweat or swim. It's important to choose a sunscreen that:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has an SPF of 30 or greater &ndash; SPF is a number that tells you how well a sunscreen protects the skin from harmful kinds of UV light.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Protects against 2 types of UV light, called &quot;UVA&quot; and &quot;UVB&quot; &ndash; Sunscreens that offer both UVA and UVB protection are sometimes called &quot;broad spectrum.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has not expired or is not more than 3 years old</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use tanning beds</p><p/><p>If you are bothered by the way your skin looks, you can use special cosmetic products to make the skin changes less obvious. Both men and women can use these products. Examples are sold under the brand names Dermablend and Covermark. Other products can also be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4983064\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, you should stop any medicines you use for vitiligo. If you use light therapy without medicines, that is still OK to do. Do not start medicines for vitiligo again until after you have your baby and are done breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4983079\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 10 to 20 percent of people, vitiligo goes away on its own. But in most people, the condition gets slowly worse, affecting more and more skin. If you are bothered or worried about how you look, speak to your doctor or nurse. You might also want to look into connecting with other people with vitiligo or joining a support group.
