The physiology of normal transient neonatal low blood glucose levels, causes of persistent or pathologic neonatal hypoglycemia, and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia are discussed separately.

The following approach is consistent with guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114343\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcome data have shown that symptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia may result in brain injury (see <a href=\"#H15598345\" class=\"local\">'Neurodevelopmental outcome'</a> below). As a result, aggressive therapy that includes the use of parenteral glucose (dextrose) is used to increase blood glucose levels in symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Therapy should be initiated while awaiting laboratory confirmation of low blood glucose levels. Although most symptomatic patients will have plasma glucose levels less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> there is great variability in the clinical response in neonates to low blood glucose concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; some newborns become symptomatic at the same or even higher blood glucose concentrations than those observed in asymptomatic infants. As a result, there is not a precise numerical blood glucose level that accurately predicts when and if a neonate will present with symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;, section on 'Challenge of defining neonatal hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114410\"><span class=\"h3\">Parenteral glucose (dextrose) infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For symptomatic patients, an intravenous (IV) bolus of dextrose, the D-isomer of glucose (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> is given over 5 minutes (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose in water [D<sub>10</sub>]). This is followed by the continuous administration of parenteral dextrose infusion at a rate of 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of dextrose per minute. If hypoglycemia is persistent, infusion rates should be increased as needed to restore and maintain normoglycemia (see <a href=\"#H437538147\" class=\"local\">'Target blood glucose levels'</a> above). The maximum rate of glucose infusion for treatment is limited by the maximum amount of fluids that can be administered to a patient (this is variable for each patient, but we have used rates as high as 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day while monitoring for evidence of hyponatremia and fluid overload) and the maximum concentration of dextrose for the type of vascular access (see <a href=\"#H437538147\" class=\"local\">'Target blood glucose levels'</a> above). In general, if the glucose infusion rate approaches 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute or infusion rates exceed 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day other interventions should be considered.</p><p>In addition, parenteral administration is used for asymptomatic infants with severe hypoglycemia (plasma glucose less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> especially after 4 hours of age, who are unable to be fed enterally or who experience persistent hypoglycemia despite oral feedings. Traditionally, parenteral glucose administration in asymptomatic patients has also consisted of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose in water followed by a continuous infusion of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/min</span> with repeat determinations of plasma glucose as noted above. However, a trial of asymptomatic newborns with a gestational age (GA) &ge;35 weeks and at risk for hypoglycemia (maternal diabetes, large for GA, fetal growth restriction, and prematurity [GA &lt;37 weeks]) found an association between rapid correction of hypoglycemia and worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As a result, these findings support a strategy of bypassing the 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/kg</span> bolus in favor of simply starting a continuous glucose infusion of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/min</span> in <strong>asymptomatic patients in these risk groups only</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H115259\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic term or late preterm infants'</a> below.)</p><p>The maximum dextrose concentrations for fluid administered through a peripheral IV catheter or a low lying umbilical venous catheter is 12.5 percent, and through a central venous catheter (including a centrally positioned umbilical venous catheter) is 25 percent. If no IV access has been established, dextrose at a concentration of 12.5 percent or less can be infused through an umbilical arterial catheter while exploring other possible forms of vascular access. In severe cases, rates of fluid administration required to deliver sufficient glucose to treat hypoglycemia may be greater than the rate of maintenance fluids. In these cases, the patient's fluid and clinical status should be monitored closely for volume overload, looking for evidence of pulmonary edema, heart failure, and hyponatremia. Infants who depend upon high infusion rates or a dextrose concentration greater than 12.5 percent require placement of a central venous catheter. In some cases diuretics may be indicated.</p><p>Plasma glucose concentration should be determined 20 minutes after the bolus infusion, and the infusion rate or dextrose concentration adjusted as needed to maintain plasma glucose concentration &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in the first 48 hours of life and &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> after 48 hours of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This dose can be given as an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, or a slow IV push over a period of one minute. The intramuscular and subcutaneous administration route is particularly useful for infants in whom IV access has not yet been established.</p><p>A rise in plasma glucose of approximately 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> should occur within 15 to 30 minutes of administration and should last approximately two hours, though a more rapid decrease in the glucose concentration may occur. Due to the short duration of action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a>, IV access must be obtained and glucose concentrations should be checked frequently and repeat doses of glucagon administered as needed. If the plasma glucose does not rise within 20 minutes of glucagon administration, then a repeat dose of glucagon is given. A failure to respond to glucagon raises the possibility of a glycogen storage disorder or defect in glycogen synthesis. In these patients, further evaluation is warranted.

However, due to the potential side effects of glucocorticoid administration, its use should be restricted to a short course (1 to 2 days), unless a patient has documented adrenal insufficiency, in which case lifelong glucocorticoid replacement will be necessary. The proposed mechanism of action of glucocorticoids is stimulation of gluconeogenesis and reduction in peripheral glucose utilization.

Blood glucose concentrations should be measured frequently starting 20 to 30 minutes after the initial and subsequent feedings.

While breast milk is strongly preferred, formula feeding may be provided for infants when breast milk is not available. </p><p>The value of early oral feedings in preventing hypoglycemia was questioned by an observational study that reported that glucose concentration was similar between infants fed early and those fed later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, this non-interventional retrospective study had several limitations, including the failure to directly measure glucose concentration before and after the first feed. In addition, most of the infants (91 percent) who fed early were breastfed. Initial feeds of breast milk are comprised of colostrum, which has very small amounts of glucose. As a result, the findings of this study do not alter our clinical practice due to the concern for the flaws in study designs.</p><p>Although, as noted above, there is not a precise numerical blood glucose level that accurately predicts when and if a neonate will present with symptoms, guidelines from the AAP and the PES recommend that additional oral feeding should be given as quickly as possible for asymptomatic patients, based on the age of the neonate and plasma glucose level. The following is our management approach regarding when an additional oral feeding is given and the need for further intervention based on the infant's response, which is consistent with these guidelines.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia#H15596030\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;, section on 'Normal transitional low glucose levels'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;, section on 'Pathologic and/or persistent hypoglycemia'</a> and <a href=\"#H15598345\" class=\"local\">'Neurodevelopmental outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of managing neonatal hypoglycemia are to correct blood glucose levels in symptomatic patients, prevent symptomatic hypoglycemia in at-risk patients, and identify newborns with a serious underlying hypoglycemic disorder, while avoiding unnecessary treatment of infants with normal transitional low blood glucose, which will resolve without intervention. The long-term goal is to prevent long-term neurologic complications. (See <a href=\"#H114291\" class=\"local\">'Goals and challenges'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;, section on 'Challenge of defining neonatal hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, target plasma glucose levels consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) guidelines are used to provide a margin of safety for infants who are at risk for neonatal hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H437538147\" class=\"local\">'Target blood glucose levels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For at-risk neonates without a suspected or confirmed genetic hypoglycemia disorder, the goal is to maintain plasma glucose &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in the first 48 hours of life, and &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> after 48 hours of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In neonates with a suspected or confirmed genetic hypoglycemia disorder, the goal is to maintain plasma glucose &gt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of neonatal hypoglycemia is a stepwise process depending on the presence or absence of symptoms and signs, and the response of the infant at each step. The following approach is consistent with guidelines published by the AAP and the PES. (See <a href=\"#H114336\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For symptomatic infants, we recommend administering parenteral glucose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Therapy should be started while awaiting laboratory confirmation. We begin with an intravenous (IV) bolus of dextrose (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> given over 5 minutes (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose in water). This is followed by the continuous administration of parenteral glucose infusion at an initial rate of 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute. If hypoglycemia is persistent, glucose infusion rates should be increased as needed. In the rare patients who fail to maintain target blood glucose levels despite maximal glucose infusion rates, we suggest the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> at an initial dose of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per hour as a continuous infusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H114343\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For asymptomatic term and late preterm infants at risk for hypoglycemia, we recommend an initial oral feeding should be given within the first hour of life (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Blood glucose concentrations should be measured frequently, starting 20 to 30 minutes after the initial feed and then before subsequent feedings. (See <a href=\"#H115259\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic term or late preterm infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For infants less than 4 hours of age and with plasma glucose &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> if plasma glucose fails to increase, parenteral glucose is administered. If the plasma glucose increases to above 25 (1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> oral feedings should continue every two to three hours with preprandial measurement of plasma glucose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For infants between 4 and 24 hours of age and with plasma glucose &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> if plasma glucose fails to increase, parenteral glucose is administered. If the plasma glucose increases to above 35 to <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> oral feedings should continue every two to three hours with preprandial measurement of plasma glucose. If a patient becomes symptomatic or if plasma glucose fails to increase above 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> after three oral feedings, then parenteral glucose should be given.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In asymptomatic infants with hypoglycemia who are breastfed, we suggest that buccal dextrose gel (dose 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is a reasonable intervention prior to feeding (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2869550067\" class=\"local\">'Dextrose gel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For more preterm infants (gestational age [GA]&lt;35 weeks) who are able to maintain adequate nutrition by enteral feeds, the management is the same as that used in term infants, with initial oral feeding within the first hour of life and ongoing monitoring of blood glucose levels. For those who are not expected to be able to receive enough enteral nutrition due to prematurity, parenteral nutrition, which includes glucose, should be started quickly. (See <a href=\"#H115681\" class=\"local\">'Preterm infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further diagnostic testing is usually reserved for infants with persistent hypoglycemia (who are not able to maintain preprandial plasma glucose &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> after 48 hours of age without IV dextrose, have severe hypoglycemia requiring prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high rates of IV dextrose infusion after 48 hours of life to treat hypoglycemia, have a family history of a genetic hypoglycemia disorder, or have physical exam features suggestive of a syndromic hypoglycemia disorder). A waiting period beyond the first 48 hours of life is necessary because it is difficult to distinguish newborns with a pathological hypoglycemia disorder (transient or permanent) from normal newborns with low transitional glucose concentrations because the biochemical features (mild hyperinsulinism) are similar. (See <a href=\"#H437537132\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15598217\" class=\"local\">'Persistent hypoglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing is based on &quot;critical samples&quot; obtained when the plasma glucose is &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Initial tests that are used to distinguish diagnostic categories for neonatal hypoglycemia are plasma insulin, beta-hydroxy butyrate, bicarbonate, lactate, and free fatty acids. The results of these tests help determine if other blood tests should be obtained to determine the underlying cause of persistent hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101681\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101681 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H437537132\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important that neonates are able to maintain plasma glucose in a normal range through cycles of feeding and fasting prior to discharge. In our practice, discharge criterion for infants who are at risk for hypoglycemia is a preprandial glucose through three feed-fast cycles &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in infants less than 48 hours of age, and &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in those who are &ge;48 hours of age. (See <a href=\"#H437536955\" class=\"local\">'Discharge criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia has been associated with brain damage, demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, and poorer developmental outcome. However, there are no available data that clearly define the glucose concentration or the duration of hypoglycemia that correlate with long-term neurologic sequelae.
