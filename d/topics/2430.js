It can cause problems with the kidneys, bones, and lungs. The word &quot;toxic&quot; means poisonous.</p><p>Cadmium is a metal that can be in many common things. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metal objects</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarettes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paint</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Batteries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fertilizer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food &ndash; Foods can be toxic if they grow in soil with cadmium in it. Grain, rice, and vegetables are some foods that pick up cadmium easily from the soil where they grow.</p><p/><p>Cadmium can also get into the air. This is happens most often around mines, smelters (places that melt down metal), and factories that use cadmium to make products such as batteries. People who work in mines or factories that use cadmium have a higher risk of cadmium toxicity than other people. People who live near a mine, factory, or farm that uses a lot of cadmium can also be at higher risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195338\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cadmium toxicity?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cadmium toxicity can happen slowly or quickly. If it happens slowly, it might not cause any symptoms at first. But cadmium can build up inside the body over time. After years of being around it, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating more often than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones &ndash; Small stones that form inside the kidneys</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bones that break easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung problems</p><p/><p>Cadmium toxicity can happen all of a sudden if a person breathes in smoke or dust with a lot of cadmium in it. If this happens, it can cause severe lung problems. A person can get very sick right away and even die.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195353\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for cadmium toxicity?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. He or she can also do the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests &ndash; These can show:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cadmium that has built up in the kidneys over time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How well the kidneys are working &ndash; People with cadmium toxicity have more of certain proteins in their urine. They also have more calcium in their urine. These can be signs that the kidneys are not working as well as they should be.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These can show cadmium in your blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone density tests &ndash; These tests use special X-rays to measure your bones. If you have cadmium toxicity, your bones might be thinner and weaker than they should be.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195368\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cadmium toxicity treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no good treatment for cadmium toxicity or the health problems it can cause. If your kidneys stop working completely, you might need to have your blood filtered by a machine. This treatment is called &quot;hemodialysis,&quot; but many people just call it &quot;dialysis.&quot; The machine takes over the kidneys' job of getting rid of waste in the blood.</p><p>If you breathe in a lot of cadmium at once, you will get treatment in the hospital. This usually happens in the intensive care unit (called &quot;ICU,&quot; for short). If you are having a hard time breathing, doctors can put a tube in your throat to help you breathe. The tube goes down the throat and into the lungs. The other end is attached to a machine that helps with breathing.</p><p>If you eat something that has a lot of cadmium in it, you might have a treatment called &quot;chelation&quot; therapy. This involves taking a medicine that helps pull cadmium out of the body. But doctors give this medicine only if they are sure that you are no longer being exposed to cadmium. And getting cadmium toxicity from food does not happen very often.</p><p>If the cadmium toxicity causes weak or soft bones, the doctor might prescribe large doses of vitamin D and other medicines to make bones stronger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195383\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cadmium toxicity be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting cadmium toxicity by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not</strong> smoking &ndash; Smoking cigarettes raises your risk of cadmium toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating food grown in soil without a lot of cadmium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using fertilizers that do not have cadmium in them &ndash; Check the label on fertilizer you use in your yard or garden.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asking your supervisor how to stay away from cadmium at work, if you work in:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A factory that uses cadmium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A farm that uses fertilizers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A place that treats sewage (liquid waste) or garbage (solid waste). Sewage or garbage can have cadmium in it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195398\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Glomerular disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Glomerular disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
