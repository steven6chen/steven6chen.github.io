With the advent of improved diagnostic methods leading to earlier diagnosis and more potent therapies, mortality has been reduced to less than 10 percent in patients with community-acquired legionellosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-legionella-infection/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>The treatment of <em>Legionella</em> infection will be reviewed here.

Conventional in vitro susceptibility methods in broth and agar have proven unreliable. For example, the charcoal in buffered charcoal yeast extract agar used for <em>Legionella</em> isolation binds antibiotics, and, thus, activity of these antibiotics against the organism is falsely minimized. Also, many commercially available antibiotics, which have excellent in vitro activity against <em>Legionella</em> by conventional testing (eg, beta-lactam agents and aminoglycosides), have proven to be relatively ineffective in patients with Legionnaires' disease.</p><p>The intracellular location of the pathogen is relevant to the efficacy of the antibiotic.

When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> is used, we favor an initial dose of 1 gram on day 1, followed by 500 mg daily, with a total duration of therapy of 7 to 10 days. Because early administration of appropriate antibiotics is associated with improved outcomes, we generally use a 1 g loading dose to help achieve therapeutic blood levels quickly (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below).

Since the source of the organism is the hospital drinking water, prevention of nosocomial legionellosis is possible. Routine culturing of the hospital drinking water should be performed regardless of whether or not cases of Legionnaires' disease have been diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-legionella-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Discovery of <em>Legionella</em> colonizing the water supply would then lead to the following proactive approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduction of <em>Legionella</em> sputum culture methodology and urinary antigen testing for <em>Legionella</em> in the microbiology laboratory of a colonized hospital.

Instead, they advocate intense laboratory surveillance of all patients with nosocomial pneumonia for Legionnaires' disease. Environmental cultures are recommended only if one or two cases are discovered. However, this CDC recommendation has been widely ignored. In the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance Survey (NNIS), only 7 percent of 192 hospitals routinely tested all clinical sputum specimens for <em>Legionella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-legionella-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>There are several other drawbacks to the CDC approach.

The second drawback is that a <em>Legionella</em> outbreak in a hospital must occur before the likely source can be investigated. In our opinion, prevention is a more attractive option given the high mortality if inadequate therapy is administered.</p><p>Guidelines for routine environmental sampling for <em>Legionella</em> in hospitals have now been adopted in several states in the United States, by the United States Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, and by many European countries.

In four studies that included a total of nearly 600 patients with Legionnaires' disease, outcomes were similar in patients who received quinolones (levofloxacin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>) compared with those who received macrolides (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>). However, more rapid defervescence, fewer complications, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shorter hospital stay were seen with the quinolones. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Selection of antimicrobial agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Quinolones versus macrolides'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected or proven <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia should be treated in most patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> (750 mg once daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 gram on day 1, followed by 500 mg once daily). Patients from long-term care facilities, those with nosocomial infection, and those who have received transplants should be treated with a fluoroquinolone to provide better coverage of other gram-negative bacilli and, in the case of transplant recipients and HIV patients, to avoid interactions between macrolides and immunosuppressive drugs. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend parenteral treatment initially for all patients with suspected <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia, given gastrointestinal dysfunction in some patients. A switch to oral therapy can be made after the patient defervesces. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The total duration of therapy for <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of antibiotics of 21 days might be considered for immunosuppressed patients who are severely ill upon presentation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination antibiotic therapy of a quinolone plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> might be considered for severely ill patients with extrapulmonary legionellosis. We also use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> as part of combination therapy with quinolones in selected patients, but drug interactions can be problematic. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Legionnaires' disease is not transmitted from person to person; thus, isolation for hospitalized patients is unnecessary. Since the source of the organism is the hospital drinking water, prevention of nosocomial legionellosis is possible by routine culturing of the hospital drinking water. Monochloramine disinfection of municipal water supplies is associated with decreased risk of <em>Legionella</em> infection in the community. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-legionella-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fraser DW, Tsai TR, Orenstein W, et al.
