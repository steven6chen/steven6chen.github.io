performing the preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is generally consistent with the 2010 guidelines of the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Sports Medicine, American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine, and American Osteopathic Academy for Sports Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and the recommendations of

class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of the PPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) are to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p

injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify and treat conditions that interfere with performance (eg, exercise-induced bronchospasm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove unnecessary restrictions on participation</p><p/><p>The PPE is not intended to serve as the comprehensive adolescent health maintenance visit. Conversely, the comprehensive health maintenance visit should not substitute for the PPE unless it includes the necessary components of the sports history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guidelines for adolescent preventive services&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2010 AAP consensus guidelines suggest that providers consider including questions on topics such as drug use, sexual activity, violence, and mental health, since these issues pose more serious threats to the health of teens than do injuries incurred during sports participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whether it is feasible <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> appropriate to explore some of these areas depends, in part, on the setting. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Setting'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3845415039\"><span class=\"h2\">Unnecessary restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One goal of the PPE is to remove unnecessary restriction on participation in sports or an exercise program. Unnecessary restriction can be imposed on children and adolescents because they are believed to have cardiac disease, because appropriate restrictions are not given an end-point, or because of concerns about complications that can be avoided with proper preventive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inappropriate restrictions can prevent children from establishing healthy lifestyle habits at a young age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-activity-and-strength-training-in-children-and-adolescents-an-overview#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical activity and strength training in children and adolescents: An overview&quot;, section on 'Benefits of activity'</a>.)</p><p>Obese patients may be inappropriately advised not to play sports until after losing weight because of concern regarding risk for heat injury. Obesity is a risk factor for heat injury, and acclimatization is indicated in preparation for summer practices; however, exercise is an important component of obesity management, and restricting exercise in children with obesity is counterproductive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-childhood-obesity-in-the-primary-care-setting#H11301691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of childhood obesity in the primary care setting&quot;, section on 'Activity'</a>.)</p><p>Osgood-Schlatter disease is another common condition for which inappropriate limitations are often put in place. Avoidance of sports activity is neither necessary nor recommended in Osgood-Schlatter disease since inactivity can lead to deconditioning which increases the risk of recurrence or other injury after returning to sports participation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)&quot;, section on 'Activity continuation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1546097382\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) should take place four to six weeks before the season starts, permitting time to evaluate and treat medical problems <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rehabilitate musculoskeletal injuries before sports participation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most sports medicine clinicians recommend that the PPE be conducted before each new level of participation (eg, middle school, junior high, high school, and college), with yearly updates of the history and targeted physical examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Requirements for the frequency of PPE vary by state, but most state high school athletic associations require annual evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that a history and physical examination be performed every two years during sports participation, with an interim history taken in the intervening years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PPE may be performed in the office setting or through a station approach. Both methods are acceptable and each has advantages and disadvantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Office setting</strong> &ndash; Examination in the office setting by the athlete's primary care provider has the advantages of privacy, continuity of care, and the provider's knowledge of past medical and family history. However, the complete examination is time consuming and may have insufficient focus on the important sports-related components of the PPE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Station approach</strong> &ndash; In the station approach, the athlete is examined by multiple examiners through a series of stations specific to individual components of the evaluation. The station approach is time efficient, sports oriented, and inexpensive, and has a high yield for identifying abnormalities; however, it generally does not afford confidentiality and may not provide for continuity of care.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2570056705\"><span class=\"h2\">Examiner</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PPE should be performed by an examiner with appropriate training and experience in evaluating the musculoskeletal system in children. Pediatric providers routinely conduct PPEs, yet many lack specific training in sports medicine or the performance of these examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The clinician performing the PPE should have a low threshold for referring athletes to a sports medicine specialist if pain or other limitations are noted in the screening musculoskeletal portion of the PPE. Similarly, the threshold for referral to a pediatric cardiologist should be low when concerns are noted in the cardiovascular assessment.

The athlete should be asked specifically if he or she has passed out; has nearly passed out; has felt lightheaded; or has had chest pain, an irregular heartbeat, or excessive, unexpected, or exceptional unexplained shortness of breath or fatigue during or after exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/1,5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,11</a>]. True anginal pain, characterized by substernal, deep, pressure-like pain that radiates and is associated with dyspnea and causes the athlete to stop activity is unusual in adolescents. The presence of any of the above symptoms that cannot be explained (eg, by vasovagal presyncope) requires exclusion from participation in competitive sports pending cardiac evaluation, and the patient should also be counseled to avoid strenuous exercise until that evaluation is complete.

This can reduce over-diagnosis of postconcussion syndrome in youth who may have baseline symptoms such as fatigue, sleep difficulties, poor concentration, and headache. In a cross-sectional sample of high school students without a history of concussion, 19 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls reported having a symptom constellation consistent with postconcussion syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

It is important to ask about asthma symptoms, particularly symptoms that occur with exercise.

If there is a history of injury or abnormalities reported on screening questionnaire, the joint or region in question should be examined in detail. In addition, we suggest complete examination of high-risk areas (ie, shoulder, knee, and ankle); however, there is no evidence that this increases the sensitivity of the evaluation or predicts future injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The screening musculoskeletal examination includes the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General inspection</strong> &ndash; The examination requires the athlete to wear clothing that permits inspection of the shoulders and extremities. The screening orthopedic examination begins with inspection of the adolescent standing with arms at the sides, facing the examiner. The observer is looking for asymmetry. Specifically:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A tilt of the head to one side can indicate a primary cervical spine injury, primary or secondary trapezius strain, or other cervical muscle spasm. Ask the athlete if any maneuver hurts or, if the parent or coach is in the room, ask him or her if this is a change in the athlete's posture. If pain occurs with movement or restriction of movement, the athlete is not permitted to participate in contact sports until further evaluation. Participation in noncontact sports is appropriate if participation does not exacerbate pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neck-stiffness-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neck stiffness in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prominence of one acromioclavicular joint usually indicates a previous acromioclavicular joint sprain (shoulder separation). The athlete can participate in all sports if no tenderness to palpation at the joint is present and if the range of motion and strength of the shoulder are normal. The acromioclavicular joint should be padded during participation so that the force, such as in direct contact of the shoulder with another athlete, can be distributed anterior and posterior to the acromioclavicular joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymmetric shoulder heights indicate trapezius strain or spasm secondary to neck or shoulder injury, paraspinous strain, primary spine injury causing secondary paraspinous muscle spasm, limb length discrepancy, or scoliosis.

Ask the athlete to look at the floor (cervical flexion), the ceiling (cervical extension), over left and right shoulders (left and right rotation), and put the right ear on the right shoulder and the left ear on the left shoulder (right and left lateral flexion). Any athlete with limitation of range of motion, weakness, or pain with neck examination is excluded from contact sports until further evaluation.

Asymmetric elevation of the shoulder before 90 degrees of abduction or inability to fully abduct the arms to 180 degrees could be caused by shoulder weakness or instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ask the athlete to hold the arms in front of the body while the examiner presses down on the hands (resisted forward flexion) and then repeat this procedure at 90 degrees of abduction. Weakness, atrophy, or fasciculations of anterior and middle deltoid muscles and pain or weakness with these maneuvers may indicate neurologic, skeletal, or muscular injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ask the athlete to put the hands behind the neck and bring the elbows back as far as possible (abduction and external rotation of the shoulder). Inability to perform this maneuver fully or apprehension about performing it, coupled with a history of the shoulder &quot;slipping out&quot; or &quot;going dead,&quot; suggests previous shoulder subluxation or dislocation that has not been adequately rehabilitated or may need surgical correction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Athletes with limitation of motion in any of the above maneuvers should be further evaluated before they are cleared for participation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elbow</strong> &ndash; Ask the athlete to extend and flex the elbows with arms to the side (90 degrees abduction). Then, with the elbows flexed at 90 degrees and the hands pointing forward, ask the athlete to pronate and supinate. Asymmetry or loss of motion in any of these maneuvers suggests previous injury. Further evaluation is necessary before the athlete can be cleared for participation, especially in throwing sports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hands</strong> &ndash; Ask the athlete to spread the fingers and then to make a fist. Look for decreased finger flexion, swollen joints, or finger deformities as residuals of previous injuries. The need for further evaluation of hand injuries and recommendations for sports participation are based upon the severity of the injury and the sport the athlete wishes to play.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Back</strong> &ndash; Inspect the back from behind and in front of the athlete looking for manifestations of scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis rarely is a contraindication for sports participation unless the angle of curvature is severe (eg, &gt;40 degrees). If the spine is painful by history or tender to palpation, the diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis should be reconsidered; the definitive diagnosis should be established before clearance for sports participation is provided. If the athlete reports lumbar pain and there is pain in the midline in the lumbar region with lumbar extension, lumbar spondylolysis should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;, section on 'Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Knee and hip</strong> &ndash; Ask the athlete to squat by placing the buttocks on the heels and then, remaining in this position, to take four steps forward (&quot;duck walk&quot;), turn around, and take four steps back to the starting position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prominent, tender tibial tuberosities, diagnostic of Osgood-Schlatter disease and common in young adolescents, may cause pain when the athlete tries to squat in full knee flexion. Athletes with Osgood-Schlatter should not be disqualified from play but should participate in a rehabilitative program that includes stretching of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, strengthening of the quadriceps muscles, and wearing a protective pad over the tibial tuberosity. The athlete should miss little if any sports participation with this treatment.

Most diagnoses of knee problems can be made on the basis of history and physical examination. Consultation with a sports medicine specialist may be necessary to determine the need for additional studies, such as radiographs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging, especially if the knee and hip condition does not improve with rehabilitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ankle</strong> &ndash; Ask the athlete to hop as high as he or she can five times on each foot. The inability to hop five times on an ankle without pain or instability indicates an undiagnosed or unrehabilitated ankle or foot injury.

Hypertension may be associated with an increased risk for sudden death and complex ventricular arrhythmias. However, hypertension has not been implicated as cause of sudden cardiac death in young, competitive athletes. Professional society guidelines recommend that athletes with uncontrolled stage 2 hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114574 \">table 6</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 4</a>) or end-organ damage (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy) be excluded from sports participation and highly static activities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 1</a>) until hypertension is better controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These recommendations are based largely on expert opinion. In addition, the treating clinician and the athlete should be aware that the use of diuretics and beta blockers has been prohibited by some athletic governing bodies; the treatment plan may need to be modified to permit participation. Information regarding banned substances can be obtained through the <a href=\"https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/the-prohibited-list&amp;token=4qjs+rZwTwTTP+rc1sEGa/YajRiTXdtvTmMj5+p7lcHF6H1d/sGN59yjitHg1nbYigfkmT8wGNhoNcmWSX5rgw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6472\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncaa.com/content/ncaa-banned-drug-list&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/4WCbu5/n3bS6kd46gecdZeV/9bN2y7byno9HC1IGARdcym1sSrb7Lh9h9eJ6qrXrg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6472\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (USA) websites. The athlete should be counseled to avoid medications and supplements that may contribute to elevated blood pressure (eg, exogenous androgens, growth hormone, supplements that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ephedrine</a> or other stimulants).

Adolescent athletes with asymptomatic bradycardia in this range can participate without further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-in-children#H2229946\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Athletes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Musculoskeletal injuries</strong> &ndash; Musculoskeletal injuries are common among athletes and identifying and fully rehabilitating old injuries is vital to prevent reinjury and optimize subsequent athletic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Previous musculoskeletal injuries can have residua, such as decreased flexibility and strength related to inadequate rehabilitation, the demands of the sport, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Players with injuries to an extremity are more likely to injure that extremity during the season than an extremity that has not been injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Proper rehabilitation can lead to lower injury rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Consultation with a sports medicine specialist may be warranted to establish a definitive diagnosis and to determine the need for radiologic imaging. In addition, the sports medicine specialist assists in managing rehabilitation of sports-related injuries and determining the plan for returning to play.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An accurate diagnosis must be established before a recommendation to participate is made. The diagnosis of a &quot;sprained knee&quot; or shoulder &quot;bursitis,&quot; for example, is not adequate. If the PPE alone is insufficient to establish a more definitive diagnosis, the athlete can return for further evaluation but should not be cleared to participate until the diagnosis is made.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once a diagnosis is made, a plan is made for rehabilitating strength, endurance, proprioception, and flexibility. In addition, the clinician should provide the athlete with a plan for returning to play. The athlete is at risk of reinjury and delayed recovery if he or she returns to competition too soon. Training errors, such as too-rapid increases in pace, distance, repetitions, or <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/resistance,</span> are the most common factor in overuse injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prior concussion</strong> &ndash; The plan for return to play after a concussion should be individualized, gradual, and progressive. Recommendations for return to sports participation following a concussion are discussed in detail separately.

The safety of the athlete is the most important consideration and the decision-making process should involve consultation with members of the specialty teams participating in the athlete's care (eg, neurosurgery, orthopedics, sports medicine, physical therapy). Recommendations for return to sports participation in children with neck injuries are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-neck-pain-or-injury#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with neck pain or injury&quot;, section on 'Return to play'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever</strong> &ndash; Children and adolescents with fever should be restricted from participation because fever may accompany myocarditis or other infections that can make exercise dangerous. In addition, fever increases the risk of heat illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In female athletes, the combination of low caloric intake with or without disordered eating, menstrual dysfunction, and low bone density is called the &quot;female athlete triad&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sports-participation-in-children-and-adolescents-the-preparticipation-physical-evaluation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Recommendations for exercise restriction made as part of the PPE are aimed at restoring the positive energy balance by reducing energy expenditure and increasing energy intake. In doing so, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function can be restored and bone health enhanced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For female athletes who have been losing weight and have developed amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea related to the weight loss, we typically advise, after an appropriate medical evaluation, reducing training by 25 percent and increasing daily energy intake by 200 to 600 calories. Follow-up should occur in one to two weeks, and if weight gain has been achieved, then the exercise restriction can be reduced accompanied by an equivalent increase in calorie intake so that weight gain continues. If a trend continues over several visits, the clinician can reduce the frequency of follow-up visits appropriately. This is best accomplished with the consultation of a sports dietitian.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other aspects of the management of exercise-associated amenorrhea and eating disorders in adolescence are discussed separately.

Obese children should receive counselling regarding the risk of heat illness (as well as other obesity-related risks) and the benefits of weight loss. If the athlete would like to lose weight, the clinician can develop a plan with the child and parents to implement dietary changes. However, for some athletes (eg, football lineman) obesity is quite common, and there may not be an interest in losing weight.

Anticipatory interventions to prevent dehydration and hyperthermia during intensive exercise or physical training should be enforced (as is the case for all athletes), particularly at the onset of conditioning training. It is unclear whether additional limitations or modifications to the exercise program are necessary in athletes with sickle cell trait. This issue is discussed in further detail separately.

It occurs frequently among young athletes in sports that involve running, cutting, and jumping and those who have recently undergone a rapid growth spurt. Therapy consists of conservative measures (ice, analgesics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and physical therapy. Continued sports participation is encouraged in most children with Osgood-Schlatter disease, provided that the pain can be tolerated.
