However, 3 to 5 percent of all patients hospitalized for acute asthma exacerbation develop respiratory failure and require invasive mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Although potentially life-saving, mechanical ventilation and its associated interventions (eg, sedatives, paralytics) can also cause morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>In this topic review, the indications, management, and adverse effects of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with severe acute asthma exacerbation will be reviewed. The pharmacologic treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and the role of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary indication for mechanical ventilation in an acute asthma exacerbation is acute respiratory failure (ie, insufficient oxygenation or alveolar ventilation). The decision to initiate mechanical ventilation should be based on serial clinical evaluations that consider the severity of airflow limitation (eg, peak expiratory flow), degree of respiratory difficulty (eg, respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;40/minute,</span> inability to talk), clinical findings (eg, accessory muscle use, intercostal retractions, fatigue, somnolence), hypoxemia, hypercapnia (elevated arterial tension of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2</sub>]), and response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Bronchoconstriction can worsen abruptly after placement of an endotracheal tube, so the need for ventilatory support must be weighed against the potential for initial worsening of ventilation. Nonetheless, intubation and mechanical ventilation should not be delayed until the need becomes emergent.</p><p>Generally, acute asthma exacerbations are associated with mild hyperventilation and a low PaCO<sub>2</sub>. However, with worsening airflow limitation, the high work of breathing leads to fatigue, a resultant decrease in the minute ventilation, and an increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, during an acute asthma exacerbation, a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 42 mmHg or greater, while technically &quot;normal,&quot; may suggest incipient respiratory failure. On the other hand, hypercapnia alone is not an indication for mechanical ventilation in the absence of decreased mental status or exhaustion.</p><p>The optimal role of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), including biphasic positive airway pressure and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation, in acute asthma exacerbations is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/3,12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-17</a>]. However, a brief trial of NPPV may be reasonable in selected patients prior to intubation and mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/3,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17-19</a>]. Failure of NPPV to improve oxygenation would be an indication for invasive mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Asthma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of mechanical ventilation during an acute asthma exacerbation are to maintain adequate oxygenation, reduce the work of breathing, and prevent barotrauma due to airtrapping, while waiting for bronchodilator and glucocorticoid medications to reverse the airway edema, inflammation, and bronchoconstriction. While maintenance of a normal arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is generally a goal of mechanical ventilation, this is not always desirable or achievable in respiratory failure due to asthma, as the amount of ventilation needed to normalize PaCO<sub>2</sub> may contribute to hyperinflation and barotrauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intubation should be approached cautiously in patients with severe acute asthma exacerbations because manipulation of the airway can cause laryngospasm and worsening of bronchoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Venous access and noninvasive monitoring should be in place prior to intubation. The clinician most experienced with airway management should intubate the patient, preferably with a large-bore (&ge;8 mm) endotracheal tube to minimize airway resistance and enable suctioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. Oral intubation is preferred over nasal intubation. Issues related to preoxygenation and patient positioning are discussed separately.

Patients with severe asthma exacerbation typically have increased airway pressures; the absence of elevated airway pressures after intubation suggests that upper airway obstruction (eg, vocal cord dysfunction, laryngeal malignancy) may have been contributing to wheezing and respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing illnesses other than asthma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2208837057\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision has been made to proceed with intubation, most patients receive rapid sequence induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The most commonly used agents are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>. Etomidate is least likely to cause hemodynamic instability, while ketamine and propofol have more bronchodilating characteristics; however, the optimal agent has not been determined. Most patients will also receive a neuromuscular blocking agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>), unless they have a contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

We typically select one of the following volume-limited modes: assist control ventilation (ACV), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), or SIMV with pressure support ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">(SIMV/PSV)</span> and adjust as needed to achieve synchrony between the patient and the ventilator. Pressure support and pressure-limited modes are less suitable for patients with airflow limitation. If a pressure-limited mode is employed, careful attention must be paid to tidal volume and gas exchange, as the volume delivered varies with airway resistance and lung compliance.

Inhaled medications can be delivered via the ventilator tubing using either a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a specialized adaptor or a jet or mesh nebulizer. Methods for delivery of inhaled medication during mechanical ventilation and the medical management of acute asthma exacerbations are discussed separately. Pretreatment with bronchodilators prior to intubation improves airway resistance in asthmatics after tracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The plateau pressure (Pplat) is measured at end-inspiration and represents the pressure in the small airways and alveoli after flow has ceased. To measure Pplat, an inspiratory hold (0.5 to 1 second) is applied at end-inspiration and the airway pressure displayed by the ventilator drops from the peak pressure to the plateau pressure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in both Ppeak and Pplat (with less than a 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O difference between them), suggests a lung parenchymal, pleural, or chest <span class=\"nowrap\">wall/diaphragmatic</span> process (eg, asynchrony, hyperinflation, pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large difference between Ppeak and Pplat indicates more airway resistance (eg, bronchoconstriction, airway mucus, endotracheal tube obstruction).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H870219\"><span class=\"h2\">Asynchrony</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient-ventilator asynchrony exists if the phases of breath delivered by the ventilator do not match those of the patient (eg, machine breath on top of patient-directed inspiration or machine breath before exhalation complete) and is manifest by agitation, tachypnea, tachycardia, use of accessory muscles, uncoordinated thoracic wall or abdominal movement, or deterioration in gas exchange. Common causes among patients with asthma include ineffective triggering of machine-assisted breaths (eg, due to insufficient trigger sensitivity or auto-PEEP as described below), intolerance of a slow inspiratory flow rate, and cough.

Normally, the end-expiratory pressure is zero or equal to any extrinsic PEEP (also known as applied PEEP) delivered by the ventilator. One consequence of intrinsic PEEP is that initiation of the next breath by the patient requires sufficient negative pressure to overcome the intrinsic PEEP and trigger the ventilator.

Increasing the extrinsic PEEP (eg, up to 80 percent of the intrinsic PEEP) can offset the adverse effects of intrinsic PEEP and reduce the effort necessary to trigger inspiration during patient-initiated breaths. However, the amount of intrinsic PEEP must be measured accurately to avoid administering excess extrinsic PEEP and exacerbating air-trapping and high inspiratory pressures.
