Caution should be used in prescribing opioids postoperatively in patients with underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as these medications can contribute to increased airway obstruction following surgery.

They did not find significant reductions in the primary outcomes of postoperative pain, need for analgesics, or secondary hemorrhage rates in patients who received perioperative prophylactic antibiotics compared with those who did not. Fewer patients had fever (a secondary outcome) when antibiotics were given (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.85), most likely due to the amelioration of bacteremia. No significant differences between the two groups were seen for the other secondary outcomes, such as time to resumption of normal diet and activity.</p><p>In keeping with these findings, the 2011 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guideline recommended strongly against the routine administration or prescription of perioperative prophylactic antibiotics for children undergoing tonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children-postoperative-care-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
