But nosebleeds are not usually serious. They are very common. The most common causes are dry air and nose-picking.</p><p>If you or your child gets a nosebleed, the important thing is to know how to deal with it. With the right care, most nosebleeds stop on their own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480410375\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if a nosebleed is serious?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see a doctor or nurse right away if your nosebleed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes blood to gush out of your nose or makes it hard to breathe</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes you to turn very pale, or makes you tired or confused</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will not stop even after you do the &quot;self-care&quot; steps listed below</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Happens right after surgery on your nose, or if you know you have a tumor or other growth in your nose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Happens with other serious symptoms, such as chest pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Happens after an injury, such as being hit in the face</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will not stop, and you take medicines that prevent blood clots, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (brand name: Coumadin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clopidogrel</a> (brand name: Plavix), or daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a></p><p/><p>If you have chest pain, feel woozy, or if you are bleeding a lot, call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1). Do <strong>not</strong> drive yourself to the hospital and do not ask someone else to drive you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480410382\"><span class=\"h1\">Nosebleed self-care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the right self-care, most nosebleeds stop on their own. Here's what you should do:</p><p>1. <strong>Blow your nose</strong>. This might increase the bleeding for a moment, but that's OK.</p><p>2. <strong>Sit or stand while bending forward a little at the waist</strong>. DO NOT lie down or tilt your head back.</p><p>3. <strong>Pinch the soft area towards the bottom of your nose, below the bone</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62213\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62213 \">picture 1</a>). Do NOT grip the bridge of your nose between your eyes. That will not work. DO NOT press on just 1 side, even if the bleeding is only on 1 side. That will not work either.</p><p>4. <strong>Squeeze your nose shut for at least 15 minutes. (In children, squeeze for only 5 minutes.) Use a clock to time yourself</strong>. Do not release the pressure before the time is up to check if the bleeding has stopped. If you keep checking, you will ruin your chances of getting the bleeding to stop.</p><p>If you follow these steps, and your nose keeps bleeding, repeat all the steps once more. Apply pressure for a total of at least <strong>30 minutes (or 10 minutes for children)</strong>. If you are still bleeding, go to the emergency room or an urgent care clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480410389\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I get repeated nosebleeds?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frequent nosebleeds can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing dry air all the time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using cold or allergy nasal sprays too much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent colds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snorting drugs into your nose, such as cocaine</p><p/><p>In some cases, repeat nosebleeds can be a sign that your blood does not clot like it should. If that is the case, there are often other clues. For instance, people with clotting problems bruise easily and might bleed more than you would expect after a small cut or scrape.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480410396\"><span class=\"h1\">Nosebleed treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you end up seeing a doctor or nurse for your nosebleed, he or she will make sure you can breathe OK. Then he or she will try to get the bleeding to stop. To do that, he or she might have to put a device or some packing material up your nose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480410403\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep from getting nosebleeds?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a humidifier (a machine that makes the air less dry) in your bedroom when you sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the inside of your nose moist with a nasal saline spray or gel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not pick your nose, or at least clip your nails before you do to avoid injury</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480410410\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nose-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nose fracture (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nosebleeds-epistaxis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nosebleeds (epistaxis) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
