This in turn leads to severe hypoxemia that may not respond to conventional respiratory support. The prevalence of PPHN has been estimated at 1.9 per 1000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of PPHN are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182566144\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal and postnatal circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the fetus, the pulmonary and systemic circuits operate in parallel. Both the right and left ventricles <span class=\"nowrap\">(RV/LV)</span> eject blood into the aorta with subsequent perfusion of the placenta, the fetal organ of respiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>). The RV is dominant, and blood is shunted right-to-left through the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, mostly bypassing the lung, which is not participating in gas exchange.</p><p>In contrast, the mature postnatal circulation operates in series. All venous return passes through the right side of the heart and into the lung, where gas exchange occurs. The oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart and is pumped into the systemic circulation for oxygen delivery to the tissues. No mixing occurs between the two sides of the circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transitional circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major circulatory adjustments occur at birth as the organ of gas exchange changes from the placenta to the lung. Under normal circumstances, a progressive fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) accompanies the immediate rise in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) that occurs after birth. For a short period, a transitional circulatory pattern exists that combines features of both the fetal and adult circulatory patterns. The decline in the <span class=\"nowrap\">PVR/SVR</span> ratio results in a steady increase in pulmonary blood flow and oxygen uptake in the lung.</p><p>The process of transition depends upon several factors. Factors that contribute to the postnatal increase in SVR include removal of the placenta, the catecholamine surge associated with birth, and the relatively cold extrauterine environment. Factors that promote the postnatal decrease in PVR include expansion of the lung to normal resting volume, establishment of adequate alveolar ventilation and oxygen tension, and successful clearance of fetal lung fluid.</p><p>Conditions that interfere with the normal postnatal decline in the <span class=\"nowrap\">PVR/SVR</span> ratio cause the transitional circulation to persist and result in PPHN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPHN occurs primarily in term or late preterm infants &ge;34 weeks gestation. Three types of abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature underlie the disorder: underdevelopment, maldevelopment, and maladaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that injury to the developing pulmonary circulation may disrupt vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and contribute to these abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Underdevelopment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In abnormalities of underdevelopment, the cross sectional area of the pulmonary vasculature is reduced, resulting in a relatively fixed elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Underdevelopment occurs with pulmonary hypoplasia associated with a variety of conditions. These include congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), congenital pulmonary (cystic adenomatoid) malformation, renal agenesis, oligohydramnios accompanying obstructive uropathy, and fetal growth restriction. Although some degree of postnatal pulmonary vasodilatation can occur, this adaptive mechanism is limited. As a result, mortality risk is greatest in this category of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital diaphragmatic hernia in the neonate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital pulmonary airway (cystic adenomatoid) malformation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal agenesis: Prenatal diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-hypodysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal hypodysplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Maldevelopment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maldevelopment is a perturbation that occurs in lungs that are normally developed, including branching and alveolar differentiation, and have a normal number of pulmonary vessels. The characteristics include abnormal thickening of the muscle layer of the pulmonary arterioles, and extension of this layer into small vessels that normally have thin walls and no muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The extracellular matrix that surrounds the pulmonary vessels also is excessive. In this disorder, remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed is thought to occur during the first 7 to 14 days after birth, with an accompanying fall in PVR.</p><p>The mechanisms that stimulate maldevelopment of the pulmonary vasculature are uncertain, but vascular mediators appear to play a role. In one report, for example, infants with severe PPHN had, compared with healthy controls, higher plasma concentrations of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 and lower concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (representing stimulation of guanylate cyclase by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a> [NO], a vasodilator that cannot be readily measured) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Genetic predisposition may influence the availability of precursors for NO synthesis and affect cardiopulmonary adaptation at birth. This was illustrated in a report in which infants with pulmonary hypertension (PH) had lower plasma concentrations of arginine, a precursor of NO and a urea cycle intermediate, and NO metabolites than control infants with respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A functional polymorphism of the gene encoding carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, which controls the rate-limiting step in the urea cycle, occurred more frequently in all of the infants with respiratory distress, with or without PH, than in the general population.</p><p>Conditions associated with PPHN caused by vascular maldevelopment include postterm delivery, meconium staining, and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). In these disorders, the pulmonary vasculature responds poorly to stimuli that normally result in a decrease in PVR, such as increased alveolar oxygen tension and the establishment of effective ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of meconium aspiration syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Disorders producing excessive perfusion of the fetal lung also may predispose to vascular maldevelopment. They include premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (eg, caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or foramen ovale, high placental vascular resistance, and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. It has been proposed that the use of NSAIDs in pregnancy is associated with PPHN due to ductal constriction in the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, subsequent data are conflicting on whether there is a true association between maternal use of NSAIDs and PPHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Maladaptation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In maladaptation, the pulmonary vascular bed is normally developed. However, adverse perinatal conditions cause active vasoconstriction and interfere with the normal postnatal fall in PVR. These conditions include perinatal depression, pulmonary parenchymal diseases, and bacterial infections, especially those caused by group B streptococcus (GBS). The mechanism of increased PVR with GBS infection is activation of vasoactive mediators by bacterial phospholipid components. In a study in newborn lambs, PH was induced by infusion of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol, phospholipids located primarily in the cell wall of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In this report based on a state-wide database that links maternal and infant hospital discharges, multiple regression analysis identified the following risk factors for PPHN: gestational age 34 to &lt;37 weeks (ie, late preterm infants), black maternal race, infants who were either large or small for gestational age, and mothers with preexisting and gestational diabetes, obesity, and advanced age. Factors associated with a lower risk of PPHN included female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, and multiple gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPHN usually occurs in term infants, although it may also present in late preterm or postterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The diagnosis is rare in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>PPHN is characterized by both prenatal and neonatal features, as illustrated in a study of 385 infants with PPHN (mean gestational age [GA] 39 weeks) cared for in participating centers in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82270018\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal findings associated with PPHN are thought to be signs of intrauterine and perinatal asphyxia.

In utero exposure of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during the second half of pregnancy has also been associated with a sixfold increased risk of PPHN compared with nonexposed infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-antenatal-exposure-to-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-and-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris#H90522798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)&quot;, section on 'Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn'</a>.)</p><p>Although PPHN is rare in VLBW preterm infants, prolonged premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) appears to be a common feature. In a prospective study of 765 preterm infants (GA &le;32 weeks), PPROM was seen in all 17 patients with echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82270030\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most neonates with PPHN present within the first 24 hours of life with signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions, and grunting) and cyanosis. In the NICHD study, more than half of the infants had low apgar scores and almost all of the patients received delivery room interventions including oxygen therapy, bag and mask ventilation, and endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>As noted above, the physical examination is characterized by cyanosis and signs of respiratory distress. In addition, there may be meconium staining of skin and nails, which may be indicative of intrauterine stress.

This differential is due to right-to-left shunting through the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). However, it is important to recognize that the absence of a pre- and postductal gradient in oxygenation does <strong>not</strong> exclude the diagnosis of PPHN, since right-to-left shunting can occur predominantly through the foramen ovale rather than the PDA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82270655\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial blood gas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An arterial blood gas sample typically will show low arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub> below 100 mmHg in patients receiving 100 percent inspired oxygen concentration), particularly samples that are postductal. However, in contrast to infants with cyanotic lesions, many infants with PPHN have at least one measurement of PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;100 mmHg early in the course of their illness. The arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is normal in infants without accompanying lung disease. The right-to-left shunting of blood through the PDA can also be documented in differences in PaO<sub>2</sub> between samples obtained from the right radial artery (preductal sample) and the umbilical artery (postductal sample).

Continuous-wave Doppler measurement of the velocity of a tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet (if present) using a modified Bernoulli equation can be used to estimate right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure.

It is caused by abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature that include underdevelopment, maldevelopment (ie, abnormally thick pulmonary arteriolar musculature), and maladaption (abnormal vasoconstriction that interferes with the normal postnatal fall in PVR). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with PPHN generally present with cyanosis and respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea). PPHN is associated with prenatal risk factors (fetal heart rate abnormalities and meconium-stained amniotic fluid), and a variety of primary respiratory disorders, such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and pulmonary hypoplasia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial testing includes pulse oximetry assessment, which may demonstrate a significant difference (&gt;10 percent) between pre- and postductal oxygen saturation, chest radiograph, which is typically normal in patients without another pulmonary condition, and an echocardiogram. (See <a href=\"#H28620636\" class=\"local\">'Initial laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PPHN should be considered in any neonate, especially term infants, with severe cyanosis, and is confirmed by echocardiography. In PPHN, the echocardiogram demonstrates normal structural cardiac anatomy and evidence of pulmonary hypertension (ie, flattened or displaced ventricular septum, or evidence of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of PPHN includes cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD), primary pulmonary disorders, and sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H82270756\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of PPHN consists of general supportive cardiorespiratory care, therapy directed towards associated pulmonary conditions, and in patients with severe PPHN, pulmonary vasodilatory agents (eg, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a> [iNO]) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to treating infants with PPHN includes the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Because oxygen is a pulmonary vasodilator, we recommend that supplemental oxygen should be initially administered in a concentration of 100 percent to infants with PPHN in an attempt to reverse pulmonary vasoconstriction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). PaO<sub>2</sub> should be maintained subsequently in the range of 50 to 90 mmHg (preductal oxygen saturation 90 to 95 percent) to minimize lung toxicity. The oxygenation index (OI) is used to assess the severity of hypoxemia in PPHN and is used to determine whether additional interventions (eg, iNO and ECMO) are warranted. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mechanical ventilation to initially maintain PaCO<sub>2</sub> between 40 and 50 mmHg, as hypercarbia and acidosis increase PVR.
