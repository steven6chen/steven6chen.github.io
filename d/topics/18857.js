Such decisions are intertwined with complex ethical, psychosocial, and financial issues that are becoming increasingly important, driven both by increasing awareness among patients and families of end-of-life decisions and, in areas of limited resources, possible rationing of resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The universal availability of renal replacement therapy in the United States forces the nephrologist to consider its application in every patient in whom it might be indicated, without concern for rationing therapy. However, foregoing dialysis is assuming more prominence as patients and clinicians recognize limitations in the survival benefit of dialysis in certain populations and the effects on quality of life.</p><p>A clinical approach to foregoing dialysis therapy is discussed here. A review of the general ethical issues involved in the care of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in the care of the patient with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical aspects of conservative (ie, nondialytic) management of ESRD patients are discussed elsewhere.

Withdrawal of dialysis means the discontinuation of maintenance dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1005173628\"><span class=\"h2\">Withholding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data regarding the number of patients who forego dialysis. The following studies have been reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of American nephrologists, nearly 90 percent reported withholding dialysis at least once during the preceding year, and over 30 percent reported withholding it at least six times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective Canadian study reported that approximately one-quarter of patients referred for initiation of hemodialysis were not offered dialysis after due consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational survey study from Australia showed that, among 721 patients with stage 5 CKD (ie, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and a mean age of 80 years, 65 percent were offered conservative treatment (ie, no dialysis) as an option; 14 percent chose to withhold dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Primary care clinicians may withhold dialysis by not referring patients to nephrologists for evaluation for possible dialysis. One study among physicians in West Virginia, for example, found that 20 of 76 primary care providers (26 percent) had effectively withheld dialysis for at least one patient by not referring the patient to a nephrologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most commonly cited reasons for not referring patients were end-stage heart, liver, or lung disease; old age; and patient refusal.</p><p>In developing countries with limited resources, the rationing of renal replacement therapy is common, usually for socioeconomic reasons. In a single-center study from South Africa, for example, 53 percent of patients evaluated were ultimately not offered renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Poverty-related factors were responsible for withholding dialysis in approximately 60 percent of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H650185669\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Withdrawal from dialysis is common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. In the United States in 2014, 24 percent of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients withdrew from dialysis prior to death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the ESRD population in the United States, withdrawal from dialysis is the third most common cause of death after cardiovascular and infectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>] and accounts for approximately 15 to 25 percent of all yearly deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/3,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11-15</a>]. Within the United States, there is regional variation in rates of withdrawal, with higher rates in the Upper Midwest and Mountain regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Withdrawal is also common in Canada and Europe. Dialysis withdrawal is the second most common cause of death among ESRD patients in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a 12-year retrospective study of 867 dialysis patients in the United Kingdom, 93 (11 percent) withdrew from dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a survey of European nephrologists, 42 percent reported that dialysis withdrawal occurred in their practice within the last year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Rates of withdrawal may be increasing. One review showed an increase in the rate of dialysis withdrawal from 3 per 1000 person-years in 1966 to 48.6 per 1000 person-years in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rates of hospice use for patients who withdraw from dialysis prior to death are also increasing, with rates ranging from 53.1 to 80.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2070530304\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased age, comorbidities, depression, and race are associated with the decision to withdraw from dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20</a>]. Patients over the age of 85 years are most likely to discontinue dialysis prior to death (34.2 percent) as compared with those patients under the age of 44 years (11.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One review of studies from the United States and Europe reported a withdrawal rate of 89.4 per 1000 person-years in patients 65 years or older versus 26.1 per 1000 person-years in patients ages 50 to 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Patients with more comorbidities and patients with greater physical discomfort are more likely to withdraw from dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/15,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21,22</a>]. Comorbid conditions that are frequently present near the time of withdrawal include diabetic gastropathy, neuropathy, the need for surgery, neoplastic disease, neurologic deterioration, worsening quality of life, and increasing pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/11,15,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15,23-25</a>]. In the Canadian study cited above in which one-quarter of patients referred for initiation were not offered dialysis, patients in whom dialysis was withheld typically had very poor functional capacity as determined by the Karnofsky scale, severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One-half of these patients had diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease and renovascular disease as a contributing cause for their renal failure.</p><p>For some patients, the reason for withdrawal is simply the overall burden that long-term dialysis places on their lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the 12-year retrospective study cited above, the majority of patients who withdrew did so because of medical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the nine patients who chose to withdraw (ie, without an acute medical precipitant) tended to be younger and were more likely to have difficulty tolerating dialysis sessions or to have experienced a functional or clinical decline since initiation of dialysis.</p><p>The race of the patient with ESRD may affect his or her decision to discontinue dialytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. Rates of withdrawal in white individuals are higher than in black individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/3,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26</a>]. A review of United States registry data (United States Renal Data System [USRDS]) showed that the odds ratio for dialysis withdrawal in black versus white patients ranged from 0.47 to 0.63 and was associated with regional variations in end-of-life expenditure index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Depressive symptoms are associated with higher rates of dialysis withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Other factors that have been associated with dialysis withdrawal in various studies include female gender, high educational level, being on hemodialysis rather than peritoneal dialysis, and, in one study, home ownership [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/9,15,18,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,18,21,22</a>].</p><p>Clinicians and patients likely have different factors influencing their decisions regarding withholding and withdrawing dialysis. In one study, patient factors included following their &quot;gut instinct&quot; and weighing how the survival benefit compared with changes in quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Medical providers were influenced by medical criteria and clinical experience rather than patient preferences. Medical criteria primarily included age, comorbidities, physical function, prognosis, and cognitive impairment. Clinicians reported struggling with the ethics around providing dialytic treatment to someone who they felt might not benefit; nevertheless, they tended to act to prolong life.</p><p>Societal factors may also play a role. In a European survey, withdrawal was more common if withdrawal of life-prolonging measures was considered to be acceptable, if decisions were shared, and if reimbursement for palliative care was thought to be established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2926447295\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and others believe that it is appropriate to withhold dialysis among the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/5,11,29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,29-33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have the capacity to make decisions and have a clear understanding of issues surrounding end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and dialysis (ie, including prognosis without dialysis) and have decided to forego dialysis.

The decision to withhold dialysis from these patients, however, needs to be made on an individual basis as dialysis may give some patients the time for the resolution of personal and social issues prior to their expected death.</p><p/><p>Limited survival benefit with dialysis has been described for patients who are &gt;75 years of age and who have two or more poor prognostic criteria including positive physician's response to the &quot;surprise&quot; question (ie, &quot;I would not be surprised if this patient died within 6 or 12 months&quot;), high comorbidity score, significant impaired functional status, severe chronic malnutrition manifested by albumin &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.

Withholding dialysis and offering conservative therapy may be appropriate in this population, and the patient and family should be engaged in conversations about prognosis and to elicit preferences.

The decision to accept or decline therapy legally resides in the patient and not with the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA), approved by Congress to encourage completion of advance directives, supports the legality of the decision to withdraw a life-sustaining treatment (such as dialysis), and &quot;so long as a doctor acts reasonably and in good faith to withhold or discontinue treatment with the consent of the patient or family, there is little chance of a criminal charge&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Informed consent emanates from the principle of autonomy and holds that patients may decline medical care.

We generally do not withdraw dialysis upon the initial request for withdrawal, but assess the patient's intent and understanding by entering into a full dialogue with multidisciplinary team support.</p><p>Because the decisions to withdraw or withhold dialysis are so complex (particularly in patients who lack decision-making capacity), it is helpful to involve members of the patient's family or social circle involved in decision making and support, including health care surrogates or proxy, as well as other members of the health care team, including social work, clergy, and dialysis nurses, in these conversations.</p><p>Psychiatric consultation may be appropriate, particularly in the assessment of competency or underlying depression. Depressive symptoms are associated with higher rates of dialysis withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Given the high prevalence of depression in the dialysis population, all patients should be screened and treated for depression, if appropriate.

Thus, the first step is to determine capacity. One definition of capacity or competence is that the patient is able to understand his condition and alternate courses of treatment, to appreciate the consequences of his choice and to reflect on it in accordance with his or her own values, and to communicate his or her decision to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H480978935\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with decision-making capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may decide to forego or stop dialysis. The nephrology provider can assess capacity of the patient by eliciting the reasons behind the patient's decision and by determining whether the patient understands the outcome of the decision.</p><p>We carefully explore why the patient requests withholding of or withdrawing from dialysis. Some patients consider withdrawal because of irremediable factors such as chronic debility, repeated dialysis access failures, and loss of limbs and eyesight. However, other patients may contemplate withdrawal because of potentially reversible factors. Such factors might include repeatedly painful needle insertions at the start of dialysis or intradialytic muscle cramps, as well as common physical and psychological symptoms of advanced illness. The nephrologist, in combination with other members of the health care team, should systematically address and modify these potentially reversible factors.</p><p>Among patients who have not yet been initiated on dialysis, a trial period of dialysis may be of use. Examples in which a dialysis trial may be useful include patients in whom fear and depression over the dialysis technique might be overcome by actually doing the procedure and patients in whom the prognosis with dialysis is uncertain due to comorbid conditions.</p><p>A trial period of dialysis of 30 to 60 days should be initiated, during which the patient is closely monitored. After the trial, the desire to withdraw from dialysis should be reassessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>We fully inform all patients with capacity about prognosis that is specific to their overall condition. We discuss ongoing medical care that will be continued if dialysis is withheld or withdrawn (ie, conservative care or palliative care).

In this setting, one needs to systematically exclude remediable factors, such as uremic or metabolic encephalopathy, and the effects of drugs. Efforts to restore decision-making capacity include discontinuing or temporarily holding medications that alter mental status and treating medical conditions such as infection, depression, and delirium that may impair mental status.</p><p>If the capacity for informed consent cannot be restored, one should look for a previously completed advance directive. Advance directives are documents in which the patient has either detailed his or her desires concerning future care in the event of becoming incompetent or has identified a surrogate agent (health care proxy) who knows the patient's desires and directs the patient's medical care accordingly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in the care of the patient with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are data suggesting that, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), advance directives may contribute to &quot;good deaths&quot; and that most patients welcome discussions about advance directives when clinicians introduce them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/45-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-51</a>]. Nephrologists have not been aggressive in promoting advance care planning, nor have they developed uniform educational policies in their dialysis units. In two prominent studies, for example, only approximately 20 percent of patients had completed advance directives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/47,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50</a>]. The identification of a surrogate decision maker is necessary for patients who lack capacity when a health care proxy has not been previously appointed by the patient and there is consideration of withholding or withdrawing dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach varies depending upon whether advance directives are in place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043324903\"><span class=\"h3\">Advance directives (living wills or health care proxies) in place</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is usually appropriate to withhold dialysis in patients without capacity who have previously given a written or documented and explicit oral advance directive indicating that they would not want life-sustaining measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135614277\"><span class=\"h3\">Advance directives (living wills or health care proxies) not in place</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is appropriate to withhold dialysis in patients who lack capacity without an advance directive who have well-known, strongly held beliefs or values that would be inconsistent with dialysis, as may be verified by the health care surrogate or proxy.

Ideally, supporting members should fully comprehend the decision. Similarly, when a surrogate has been appointed, this individual should be equally involved and aware of the decision.</p><p>Patients may prefer to discuss dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">withholding/withdrawal</span> with family rather than physicians. This was suggested by one study in which 50 percent of patients preferred to discuss these decisions with family members compared with 6 percent who preferred discussion with physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Specific issues related to palliative care of such patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: End-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The staff can optimally guide the care of the dying patient by capitalizing on the patient's priorities and discussing in advance the effects of the dying process on the patient and family. Collaboration with hospice services can also be of benefit. The dialysis-care team should insure that patients have addressed major financial and personal affairs such as wills. This is the time for patients to communicate with loved ones and to come to terms with their life. Withdrawal of dialysis, performed in this deliberate manner, can contribute to a &quot;high quality of death&quot; and a &quot;reconciled death&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/24,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,53-55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1221561464\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1353150847\"><span class=\"h2\">Withholding dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expected outcome of patients with advanced renal disease who forego dialysis is death within a variable period of time. The time to death depends on the indication for dialysis. Among those with acute kidney injury (AKI), whose indications for dialysis often include hyperkalemia, refractory volume overload, or severe acid-base disturbances, patients typically die within days if dialysis is not initiated.</p><p>Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those who are closely followed by a nephrologist, chronic dialysis is more commonly initiated for worsening nutritional status or for mild-to-moderate symptoms of uremia rather than for electrolyte or acid-base disturbances or refractory volume overload. Such patients may survive for weeks or months after a decision is made to forego chronic dialysis, with one study estimating median survival up to 16 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Perhaps the best published estimate of the range of time until death is from a systematic review of seven cohort studies, which reported a median survival of at least six months, with a range of 6.3 to 23.4 months when chronic dialysis was not initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A study published after the systematic review and including 122 older patients treated with supportive nondialytic care reported a median survival time of 16 months; 32 percent of patients survived &gt;12 months after the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The wide range can be narrowed considerably for individual patients based upon age, comorbidities, functional status, nutrition, and other factors. As an example, in the systematic review cited above, the study with the shortest survival included patients who were recommended for conservative (ie, nondialytic) therapy by a multidisciplinary team because of their poor dialysis candidacy based upon extensive comorbidities and functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>By contrast, the study that reported the longest survival had the youngest patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In this study, the Stoke comorbidity grade (SCG), which is a validated scoring system for the survival of patients on dialysis, independently predicted survival among patients being treated conservatively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.53 for each incremental increase in score based upon comorbidities. The one-year survival for comorbidity scores of 0, 1, and 2 were 83, 70, and 56 percent, respectively.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that, among patients with CKD, factors that may predict a longer survival with conservative management include female gender, fewer comorbidities, better nutrition (defined as albumin &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> age, and early referral to a nephrologist, but these studies are not well validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/56,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,59-61</a>].</p><p>It is important to note that many variables, such as age and comorbidities, also predict a poor prognosis among patients initiating dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A risk stratification score has been developed to predict three-month mortality in patients over the age of 75 years who were initiated on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Factors identified as independent variables included increased age, male gender, and comorbidities (including congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dysrhythmia, cancer, behavioral disorder, hypoalbuminemia, and impaired mobility). Those patients in the &quot;high-risk group&quot; were estimated to have a three-month mortality of &gt;40 percent. (See <a href=\"#H2926447295\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p>Some studies that have compared conservative (nondialytic) management with dialytic therapy have not shown a survival advantage conferred by dialysis among older patients (ie, &gt;75 years of age who have comorbidities, particularly ischemic heart disease), whereas other studies that enrolled either younger patients or did not account for comorbidities have shown a survival advantage with dialysis. These data are discussed elsewhere.

United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data from 2017 report shorter survival after discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis as compared with patients maintained on hemodialysis: four as compared with seven days, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Independent predictors of earlier mortality included male sex, white race, referral from a hospital or nursing <span class=\"nowrap\">home/hospice</span> residence, lower functional status (defined by Palliative Performance Scale Score &lt;20), peripheral edema, and supplemental oxygen requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. A study from Scotland described factors associated with physical independence to be associated with withdrawal, specifically older age, prior cerebrovascular disease, and longer final hospital admission. Other important factors associated with withdrawal included untreatable infections, frailty, cognitive impairment, pain, limitations in treatment options, and vascular access complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Hospice utilization is highest for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who discontinue dialysis prior to death.

The combination of these social forces and the expected doubling of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population in the United States may make the withdrawal and withholding of dialysis an increasingly common problem for the nephrologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A study interviewed nephrologists in England and the United States regarding their experiences in forgoing and withdrawing dialysis to identify potential barriers. Common themes included national and institutional policies, the culture of medicine, a lack of training in end-of-life conversations, and societal pressures for aggressive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Few nephrologists have participated in formal ethics training or feel that they have the resources necessary to provide adequate conservative and supportive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, few nephrology fellowship programs include training in effective communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Nephrologists may also substantially disagree about the provision of dialysis in several important clinical settings. As an example, one study found discord among surveyed nephrologists relating to the management of patients lacking capacity whose prior wishes about their future medical care are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>National forums should be used to discuss this issue.

If a patient has willingly begun dialysis with a fully open communications policy (atmosphere), then this same patient should be able to withdraw, exercising his or her own best judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/11,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,72,73</a>].</p><p>Some nephrologists likely have not been as vigorous as necessary in promoting the use of advance directives, despite the utility of such documents in providing guidance for future medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in the care of the patient with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>). Nephrologists should pursue and advocate the use of advance directives in all patients, especially those under their care. For patients already on dialysis, the dialysis provider should ideally provide support for the nephrologist in this process through training and availability of appropriately trained social workers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568741080\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decisions to withdraw or withhold dialysis are common. Withdrawal of dialysis means the discontinuation of maintenance dialysis. Withholding dialysis is defined as foregoing dialysis in a patient in whom dialysis has yet to be initiated in the setting of either acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generally, patients who withdraw from dialysis are older, have more comorbidities, and experience more physical discomfort, particularly during dialysis sessions. Other factors that have been associated with an increased rate of withdrawal include white race, female gender, and education. For some patients, the reason for withdrawal is simply the overall burden that long-term dialysis places on their lives. (See <a href=\"#H2070530304\" class=\"local\">'Associated factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our indications for withholding or withdrawing dialysis are largely consistent with the Renal Physicians <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Society of Nephrology <span class=\"nowrap\">(RPA/ASN)</span> guidelines and are defined above. (See <a href=\"#H2926447295\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principle of autonomy and the rights of self-determination and privacy are ethical principles supporting the right of individuals to withdraw from dialysis or to decline the initiation of dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H4090715084\" class=\"local\">'Ethical and legal issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our clinical approach to withholding or withdrawing dialysis is largely consistent with the <span class=\"nowrap\">RPA/ASN</span> guidelines. In all cases, the nephrologist should first develop a physician-patient relationship for shared decision making. We use a stepwise approach that differs based upon whether the patient has decision-making capacity. (See <a href=\"#H97169864\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach to withholding or withdrawing dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The expected outcome of patients who withhold dialysis despite a clinical indication is death within a variable period of time. The time to death depends on the indication for dialysis. Among those with acute kidney injury (AKI), patients typically die within days if dialysis is not initiated. Patients with CKD may survive for weeks or months after a decision is made to forego chronic dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H1353150847\" class=\"local\">'Withholding dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcome of patients who withdraw from dialysis is also death within a variable period of time. However, the course of patients who withdraw from dialysis is generally much shorter than that of patients who elect not to start dialysis in the first place and is often dependent upon the degree of residual kidney function. In the absence of residual function, death occurs in an average of seven to eight days.
