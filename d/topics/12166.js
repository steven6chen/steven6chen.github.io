Preoperative counseling should be offered to all patients undergoing a mastectomy. Autogenous tissue can also be used to improve the cosmesis of select patients who have a less than ideal result following breast conservation or implant-based reconstruction with or without radiation therapy.</p><p>This topic will review the autologous tissue options available for reconstruction following a mastectomy. The preoperative assessment for reconstruction and the reconstructive approach using prosthetic devices available for reconstruction are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implant-based breast reconstruction and augmentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540361\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of musculocutaneous flaps and microsurgical tissue transplantation paved the way for modern autologous tissue breast reconstruction. Musculocutaneous flaps consist of a segment of vascularized muscle with the overlying skin and fat which are perfused by perforating vessels from the underlying muscle. These flaps may be transposed into position with their vascular origin intact (&quot;pedicled&quot; flaps).</p><p>Alternatively, the flap and its vascular supply can be completely harvested and transferred to the mastectomy site, requiring anastomosis of the flap's artery and vein to local vessels at the recipient site, usually the internal mammary or thoracodorsal vessels (&quot;free&quot; or microsurgical flaps). Although these microvascular free flaps have traditionally included a segment of underlying muscle, a newer version, called a perforator free flap, harvests only the vascular supply (artery and vein) and the overlying skin and fat.</p><p>When reconstruction of the breast mound is accomplished using the patient's own tissues, the result is typically more natural in both appearance and feel than with <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> reconstruction. Autologous tissue reconstruction also tends to provide a better match for a large, ptotic contralateral breast, particularly if alteration of the opposite breast is not desired. Furthermore, autologous reconstruction may be the only available reconstructive option for patients who have large soft tissue deficits or chest wall skin that is unsuitable for tissue expansion due to scar tissue or radiation-induced changes. The disadvantages of autologous reconstruction include longer surgical procedures and prolonged recovery time as compared with prosthetic reconstruction. The risk of total flap failure is usually less than 3 percent with experienced surgeons. As an example, in one series of 614 microsurgical flaps for breast reconstruction, there were 12 cases of flap loss (1.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Autologous reconstruction requires proper patient selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Some women are interested in a short operation with a rapid recovery and may be inclined to choose implant-based reconstruction, whereas others are less interested in the duration of the procedure or the recovery but are more interested in a durable procedure that improves with time. Some women choose autologous reconstruction because they do not want any prosthetic material in their body. For women that have had previous radiation therapy, autologous reconstruction is often considered the ideal choice because the vascularized flap will tend to perform better over time compared with a prosthetic device. </p><p>In order to be considered for autologous breast reconstruction, patients should be in good physical health and have adequate tissues at the various donor sites that include the abdomen, gluteal region, posterior thorax, and thigh region. Although women with larger body mass index (BMI) (&gt;30) tend to choose flap-based breast reconstruction with higher frequency, autologous reconstruction can be performed in women with a variety of body types and for a wide range of BMI. With the increasing awareness of perforator flaps, many more women are considering autologous options given that donor site morbidities tend to occur with less frequency for these compared with flaps using the entire donor site muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2130736893\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAM FLAP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540367\"><span class=\"h2\">Pedicled TRAM flap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most commonly used autologous tissue reconstructions is the TRAM (transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous) flap. The flap is comprised of an ellipse of lower abdominal skin, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. The skin and subcutaneous fat of the lower abdomen receive their blood supply from the underlying muscle via perforating vessels from the superior and inferior epigastric arteries, which arborize through the rectus abdominus muscle. The pedicled TRAM flap is based on the superior epigastric artery and vein, and is rotated into the breast pocket with the superior portion of the muscle (and blood supply to the flap) still attached to the costal margin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54291 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>TRAM flaps use a transversely oriented skin island from the lower abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This design incorporates an abdominoplasty (&quot;tummy tuck&quot;) as part of the donor site closure. Using a single rectus muscle, up to 75 percent of the infraumbilical skin and fat can be harvested for the pedicled TRAM flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71810\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71810 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Some women have a greater tissue volume requirement than can be provided by a single rectus muscle. In these cases, both rectus muscles may be raised with the TRAM flap (a bipedicled TRAM). By using both rectus muscles to feed the flap, a larger portion of the abdominal skin and fat can be carried, and the likelihood of fat necrosis or flap loss is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The main limitation of the bipedicle TRAM flap for a unilateral reconstruction is that both rectus abdominis muscles are usually sacrificed. With the advent of alternative donor sites and with microvascular muscle-sparing procedures, bipedicle TRAM flaps are now uncommon. However, a pedicle TRAM can be coupled with a microvascular free TRAM or deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap for unilateral reconstructions needing additional volume with less morbidity to the abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Other methods are commonly used to augment the sometimes tenuous arterial blood supply or venous drainage of a pedicled TRAM flap. With a preliminary vascular delay procedure, the inferior epigastric vessels are ligated at least one week prior to the reconstruction. The superior epigastric vessels dilate in response to the relative hypoperfusion of the tissue in their vascular territory, an effect that appears to permanently augment the vascular supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This procedure can be used for both unipedicled and bipedicled flaps, and is most often used in patients who are at higher risk for fat necrosis and flap loss.</p><p>A second technique, called &quot;supercharging&quot; the flap, involves anastomosing the deep inferior epigastric artery and vein microsurgically into the thoracodorsal or internal mammary vessels to augment the vascular supply of the pedicled TRAM flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages </strong>&ndash; Like other autologous tissue reconstructions, pedicled TRAM flaps produce a natural appearance and texture in the new breast. The aesthetic results tend to age well, seldom requiring revision in later life to maintain symmetry with the contralateral breast. Unlike <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> techniques, pedicled TRAM reconstructions are essentially one-stage procedures: patients do not require multiple operations or weekly tissue expansions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Disadvantages of this type of reconstruction include long operative times (four to eight hours), relatively long hospitalizations (three to five days), and a longer postoperative recovery. Although it usually takes one to two months, it can take women up to two to four months to return to their preoperative physical functioning. Other outcomes associated with TRAM flap reconstruction, including patient satisfaction and postreconstruction physical functioning, are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction#H41\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient selection </strong>&ndash; Although TRAM reconstruction is a safe and reliable procedure, patient selection is critical to avoid flap loss and donor site morbidity. The ideal candidate for a pedicled TRAM flap is a nonsmoking, nondiabetic patient of normal weight with adequate soft tissue in the lower abdomen to match the volume of the contralateral breast. Patients with diabetes mellitus can be candidates for TRAM flap reconstruction assuming good glucose control and hemoglobin A1c levels that are less than seven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Overweight and obese patients are also candidates for TRAM flaps assuming they are in good general health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Absolute contraindications include a previous TRAM flap, abdominoplasty, or an open bilateral subcostal scar that violates the blood supply of the pedicles. Active smoking, obesity, diabetes, collagen vascular disease, postmastectomy radiation therapy (RT), and the presence of certain abdominal scars all increase the risk of complications with the flap and wound healing problems at the lower abdominal donor site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outcomes </strong>&ndash; Major complications from TRAM flap reconstruction are rare. These include total flap loss (1 percent or less) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], which necessitates surgery to both remove necrotic tissue and perform an additional procedure to reconstruct the breast. Rarely, patients can also experience bleeding, infection, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lesser complications are relatively common, including fat necrosis, acute partial flap loss, seroma, and lower abdominal laxity or hernias. Fat necrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> partial flap loss occur when a fatty region of the flap within the flap does not receive enough blood supply. The resulting tissue fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcification can simulate a mass in the reconstructed breast on postoperative physical examinations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute partial flap loss, usually manifested by small areas of skin loss, is usually treated nonoperatively, with dressing changes to promote secondary healing. Seromas most commonly occur in the donor site and may require percutaneous aspiration or reinsertion of a surgical drain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The incidence of long-term complications such as abdominal wall laxity, bulge, or hernia was 8 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and 3 percent in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These complications generally require surgical repair. Preventive maneuvers to reduce the incidence of abdominal bulge or hernia are useful and often require the use of a surgical mesh to reinforce the abdominal fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540373\"><span class=\"h2\">Free TRAM flap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike the pedicled TRAM flap, which leaves the rectus abdominis muscle attached to the costal margin and tunnels the lower abdominal skin and fat into the mastectomy site, the free TRAM flap completely detaches and directly transfers the lower abdominal tissue to the mastectomy site. The deep inferior epigastric artery and vein, which provide the vascular supply for the free flap, are anastomosed to local recipient vessels, using either the internal mammary or the thoracodorsal arteries and veins. Thereafter, the free TRAM flap is contoured and inset in a fashion similar to that of the pedicled TRAM. Donor site closure is the same with both types of TRAM flaps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64061 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages </strong>&ndash; Free TRAM flaps may provide a more robust blood flow, particularly to the perforators, making the flap&rsquo;s blood supply more reliable than pedicled TRAM flaps. Disadvantages of this technique include potentially longer operating times and the need for microsurgical expertise. Furthermore, a trained nursing staff is required in the early postoperative period for flap monitoring in order to detect vessel thrombosis and resulting flap compromise. The rate of total flap loss is also somewhat higher than that for pedicled TRAM flaps (2 to 5 versus less than 1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient selection </strong>&ndash; Because the free TRAM flap may provide a more robust blood supply than the pedicled TRAM flap, the free TRAM may be preferred when the mastectomy defect requires large amounts of skin and soft tissue coverage, or when large unilateral or bilateral reconstructions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75822\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75822 \">picture 2</a>) require the use of peripheral portions of the flap. In addition, the more generous blood supply can improve flap survival in patients who have risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, or obesity. Some women who are not candidates for pedicled TRAM flaps due to previous subcostal incisions and resultant interruption of the superior epigastric vessels can undergo free TRAM flap reconstruction without difficulty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outcomes</strong> &ndash; Complications in the early postoperative period include infection, hematoma, seroma, donor site necrosis, and partial or total flap loss. As noted above, the rate of total flap failure is somewhat higher for free TRAM than for pedicled flaps (2 to 5 versus less than 1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], although the free flap is more resistant to partial loss than is the pedicled TRAM flap. As with pedicled TRAM reconstructions, long-term complications for the free TRAM flap include abdominal wall laxity or hernia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498702795\"><span class=\"h1\">LATISSIMUS DORSI (LD) FLAP</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient selection </strong>&ndash; LD flaps are useful in patients who are not good candidates for <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> or TRAM reconstruction or who have failed prior flap reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In some individuals, the skin at the mastectomy site may be compromised from previous RT or surgical trauma, thus eliminating expander-implant reconstruction as a viable option.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">LD flaps also represent an acceptable alternative for patients who require autologous tissue reconstruction but are not appropriate candidates for TRAM flaps because of obesity, active smoking, or significant medical comorbidity. LD flaps also are commonly used for reconstruction of contour defects following lumpectomy and RT in breast cancer patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67952 \">figure 3</a>). Finally, LD flaps can work well for salvage of breast reconstruction in cases of partial or total loss of other types of autologous tissue reconstruction, provided that the thoracodorsal vessels or the LD muscle have not been sacrificed in previous operations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages </strong>&ndash; The advantages of LD reconstruction include flap reliability and suitability in patients who may be marginal candidates for more complicated flap techniques. The LD flap is a pedicle flap but does not require microvascular reconstruction and is easier to perform than abdominal-based flaps. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Disadvantages of the LD flap include significant donor site scarring and the frequent need for an implant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tissue expander placement due to insufficient flap volume. The latissimus dorsi muscle may also atrophy over time, making the underlying implant more prominent and causing contour irregularities in the reconstructed breast. In a report of 68 women undergoing reconstruction with combined LD flaps and implants followed for at least 10 years, one-half needed additional surgeries for exchange or removal of the prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outcomes </strong>&ndash; Complications from LD flaps include hematoma, infection, fat necrosis, and partial or total flap loss. Because the blood supply to the latissimus is extremely reliable, the incidence of flap loss is relatively low compared with other autologous tissue options for breast reconstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common complication is seroma formation in the LD donor site; rates as high as 12 to 21 percent are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Although it has not been systematically studied, the impact of LD harvest on shoulder function appears to be minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540379\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORATOR FLAPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an effort to conserve muscle, &quot;perforator&quot; flaps harvest only the skin and fat overlying the muscle. The dominant artery and vein supplying the flap are dissected from the muscle, thus preserving it in its natural location. It is important to emphasize that the muscle is split longitudinally but not harvested with the flap. Perforator flaps are usually free flaps but can be pedicled. The free flap is then transferred as described above for free TRAM flaps. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540385\"><span class=\"h2\">DIEP perforator flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used perforator flap for breast reconstruction is the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66615\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66615 \">figure 4</a>). The DIEP uses the same lower abdominal island of skin and fat as TRAM techniques but spares the rectus abdominis muscle. Also, as with TRAM flaps, the DIEP donor site is closed as a modified abdominoplasty. The likelihood of requiring a surgical mesh for abdominal closure is reduced because the muscle and the overlying fascia are preserved.</p><p><strong>Patient selection </strong>&mdash; Similar to TRAM flaps, patient selection for DIEP flaps should be made on the basis of body weight, medical comorbidities, quantity of abdominal fat, and breast volume. Patients who are very concerned about abdominal wall morbidity (ie, bulging, weakness, or hernia) after a TRAM reconstruction may also be candidates.</p><p>Contraindications to DIEP reconstruction are similar to those for TRAM flaps and include prior history of abdominoplasty or abdominal liposuction and active smoking (within one month of surgery). Relative contraindications include large transverse or oblique abdominal incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Pfannenstiel scars do not appear to influence complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Overweight and obese patients can still be good candidates for DIEP flap reconstruction assuming they are in good general health. However, as body mass index increases, so do complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Successful transplantation of perforator flaps requires blood vessels of suitable caliber and location. Accordingly, some surgeons employ preoperative evaluation of perforator vessels using modalities such as computerized tomographic (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages and disadvantages</strong> &ndash; The DIEP flap has all of the advantages of the free TRAM flap and a similar aesthetic outcome, but may be associated with a lower incidence of abdominal wall laxity and weakness, less postoperative pain, and shorter recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/21,27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27-33</a>]. In appropriately selected patients, some microsurgeons prefer DIEP flaps over free TRAM reconstruction. Given the choice between muscle preservation and muscle sacrifice, most patients will choose total muscle preservation because of improved function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Significant microsurgical expertise is required for the meticulous dissection and anastomosis of perforators as small as one millimeter in diameter. The complexity of the procedure contributes to longer operative times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outcomes</strong> &ndash; Patients should be counseled preoperatively that consideration of a DIEP flap as a reconstructive option depends upon the number, caliber, and location of the perforating vessels. If the inferior epigastric perforators are noted intraoperatively to be insufficient to support the entire flap, the procedure may need to be converted to a standard free TRAM reconstruction, in which case a portion of the rectus muscle would be harvested with the flap. Studies have demonstrated that there is very little difference in functional outcome comparing the DIEP flap to the muscle-sparing free TRAM following unilateral breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complications of the DIEP flap include fat necrosis, partial flap loss, total flap loss, and abdominal wall laxity or hernia. In a series of 758 DIEP flaps performed for breast reconstruction, 6 percent of patients were returned to the operating room for flap-related problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Partial flap loss occurred in 2.5 percent and total flap loss in less than 1 percent. Other problems included fat necrosis in 13 percent (risk factors were smoking and postreconstruction RT), seroma formation at the abdominal donor site in 5 percent, and abdominal hernia in 0.7 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether the incidence of partial and total flap loss is higher than with traditional TRAM procedures is unclear. Some studies show that DIEP flaps have a less robust blood supply than TRAM flaps, and therefore an increased risk of fat necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. One study, for example, compared 105 women who underwent bilateral pedicled TRAM flaps with 58 women who had bilateral DIEP flap reconstructions; there were significantly higher rates of partial skin loss, wound dehiscence, and fat necrosis with the DIEP flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There were no significant differences in the incidence of seromas or hematomas, back pain, abdominal hernias, or bulges between the two groups. Other studies suggest that rates of partial flap loss and fat necrosis are no higher with perforator flaps than with pedicled TRAM procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540391\"><span class=\"h2\">SEIA perforator flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) perforator flap provides the same abdominal tissue for breast reconstruction as the DIEP flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While not all patients have superficial inferior epigastric vessels of sufficient caliber to support transfer of the associated lower abdominal skin and fat, basing the flap on the superficial inferior epigastric vessels can provide a reliable, less invasive free flap option for breast reconstruction in appropriately selected patients.</p><p>Careful intraoperative evaluation of the superficial inferior epigastric vessels is mandatory with this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. If the vessels are undersized or otherwise not suitable, the flap can be converted into a DIEP or free TRAM for a more reliable vascular supply.</p><p>The indications for a SIEA flap are the same as for a DIEP flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, the SIEA flap is associated with even less donor site morbidity than the DIEP flap as no fascial incisions or muscle dissection are required. The SIEA flap is limited by variable anatomy, particularly with regard to the presence and size of the superficial inferior epigastric arteries. SIEA flaps are not anatomically and technically possible in most patients, and the available volume of tissue is limited. </p><p>As with the DIEP flap procedures, significant microsurgical expertise is required for the meticulous dissection and anastomosis of SIEA perforators as small as one millimeter in diameter. The complexity of the procedure contributes to longer operative times. In a retrospective review of over 200 SIEA flap breast reconstructions, there were no flap losses and the rate of return to the operating room was similar to that with DIEP flap reconstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540397\"><span class=\"h2\">GAP perforator flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who do not have sufficient lower abdominal fat for TRAM, DIEP, or SIEA flaps, but who prefer the use of autologous tissue, a more viable donor site may be the buttock area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75614 \">figure 5</a>). For this free flap, perforating vessels from either the superior gluteal artery (SGAP flap) or the inferior gluteal artery (IGAP flap) can be used as the vascular supply for the transferred tissue. For the SGAP flap, upper buttock tissue is used, resulting in a donor site scar that is concealable under most swimwear. If an IGAP flap is performed, the donor site scar lies within the lower buttock crease.</p><p>Advantages of GAP flaps include the ready availability of sufficient soft tissue for breast reconstruction in most patients. Furthermore, these flaps do not require the sacrifice of the gluteus maximus muscle and thus do not appear to have any adverse impact on postoperative functioning. </p><p>Disadvantages of GAP flaps include the technical challenges of flap harvest and transfer, and the associated risk of sciatic nerve injury. In general, the caliber and length of the vascular pedicle associated with gluteal perforator flaps is less than its abdominal counterpart (DIEP flap). Some patients report postoperative pain due to insufficient padding of the sciatic nerve. </p><p>In a retrospective review of 170 GAP flaps, 8 percent of patients required a return to the operating room with a 6 percent rate of vascular complications and total flap failure rate of 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540403\"><span class=\"h2\">TUG flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transverse upper gracilis (TUG) flap is based on the proximal gracilis muscle and its vascular pedicle, the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54628\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54628 \">figure 6</a>). This flap utilizes tissue from the posterior upper <span class=\"nowrap\">thigh/lower</span> buttock and provides another choice for women with insufficient lower abdominal fat for breast reconstruction. The advantage of the TUG flap is avoidance of scars on the abdomen, back, or gluteal region. The TUG flap is appropriate for small to moderate volume breast reconstruction because there is usually not a large quantity of fat in the upper thigh.</p><p>As with the DIEP flap procedure, significant microsurgical expertise is required for the meticulous dissection and anastomosis of TUG perforators, which are as small as one millimeter in diameter. The complexity of the procedure contributes to long operative times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1535617989\"><span class=\"h2\">PAP flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The profunda artery perforator (PAP) flap is becoming the preferred second option for many microsurgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. This flap is based off the profunda femoris artery and vein that has several associated perforators within the posterior compartment of the thigh. This flap is often considered as an alternative to abdominal flaps and is ideally suited for women with small- to moderate-sized breasts. The advantages of this flap over gluteal or medial thigh flaps are that lymphedema risk is minimal, pedicle length is increased, and gluteal contour is not affected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826540409\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications associated with autologous reconstruction include, but are not limited to, total or partial flap failure, infection, fat necrosis, and contour abnormalities. Donor site complications include seroma, muscle weakness, bulge, hernia, infection, pain, contour abnormality, and lymphedema. In a review of 468 patients and 565 deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps, postoperative complications requiring reoperation were twice as likely for bilateral reconstruction, and the risk of total flap loss was six times greater in bilateral reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1826540373\" class=\"local\">'Free TRAM flap'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly used perforator flap for breast reconstruction is the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66615\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66615 \">figure 4</a>). The DIEP uses the same lower abdominal island of skin and fat as TRAM techniques but spares the rectus abdominis muscle.
