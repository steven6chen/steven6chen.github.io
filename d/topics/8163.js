The best data regarding prevalence among deceased organ donors are from a study of 13,667 potential organ donors evaluated between 2004 and 2008 by 17 organ procurement organizations in the United States; HCV prevalence was 3.45 percent among normal-risk potential donors and 18.2 percent among high-risk potential donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In two reports, among recipients of organs from anti-HCV-positive donors, 14 to 100 percent tested positive for anti-HCV antibodies after transplantation, and 57 to 96 percent tested positive for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. The differences in the rate of transmission of HCV infection by anti-HCV-positive donors could be related to the prevalence of HCV RNA among these donors.</p><p>Transplant recipients who receive organs from HCV-positive donors have a high risk of acquiring HCV infection and liver disease. Some studies have shown nearly universal transmission; in one report, 75 percent of the 29 recipients of organs (19 kidneys, 6 hearts, 4 livers) from 13 anti-HCV-positive donors became anti-HCV or HCV RNA positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Others have not found quite as strong an association; only 13 of 46 (29 percent) kidney recipients of recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA)-positive donors developed posttransplant liver disease in a second series, although HCV RNA was not checked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Despite the latter study, concern over the risk of HCV transmission is great.</p><p>There are occasional reports of infection of recipients who received kidneys from donors who were negative for anti-HCV antibodies at the time of organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Some cases have been presumed due to acute infection of the donor just prior to kidney donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, in some cases, samples of blood archived at the time of organ donation subsequently tested positive for HCV RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p>In 2012, a kidney recipient was infected with HCV from a donor who was negative for both anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. HCV genotype 2b was isolated from donor splenocytes procured at organ recovery, which could also be detected in the kidney recipient. Active injection drug use and recent plasma transfusion were identified as HCV-related risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080135457\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES OF TRANSPLANTATION OF HCV-POSITIVE KIDNEY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recipients of kidneys from HCV-infected donors have decreased survival compared with those who receive kidneys from non-HCV-infected donors but better survival compared with individuals who remain on the waiting list. Further studies are needed to investigate whether safe and effective direct antiviral agents improve long-term clinical outcomes in recipients (both HCV positive and negative) of HCV-positive kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080135706\"><span class=\"h2\">Compared with HCV-negative kidneys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCV-negative recipients of HCV-positive kidneys may have decreased survival compared with recipients of HCV-negative kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This was suggested by a study of 20,111 kidney transplants performed between 1994 and 1998, of which 484 kidneys were positive for HCV, and 165 HCV-positive kidneys were transplanted into HCV-negative recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The three-year survival was lower among recipients of HCV-positive kidneys compared with HCV-negative recipients of HCV-negative kidneys (85 versus 93 percent, respectively).</p><p>Several studies have found that transplant patients who received organs from HCV-positive donors suffer from higher rates of liver disease than transplant patients who received organs from negative donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/14,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080135712\"><span class=\"h2\">Compared with waitlisted patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There appears to be a survival advantage associated with receiving a kidney from an anti-HCV-positive donor compared with remaining on the deceased-donor waitlist. Among nearly 40,000 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) patients awaiting transplantation, transplantation with such a kidney was associated with improved survival versus remaining on a transplant waitlist (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080135829\"><span class=\"h2\">Among HCV-positive recipients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of transplanting a kidney from an HCV-positive donor into an HCV-positive recipient is not completely clear. Most studies suggest that morbidity and mortality of HCV-positive recipients are not increased by the transplantation of kidneys from HCV-positive donors, despite the possibility of superinfection with HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. In one report that included 468 HCV-positive recipients, 5- and 10-year survival were not different between recipients of kidneys from HCV-positive and HCV-negative donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In contrast, other single-center as well as large registry studies have shown increased mortality and adverse liver outcomes associated with the transplantation of HCV-positive kidneys in HCV-positive recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Differences in immunosuppression or superinfection with another genotype may explain the observed differences in outcomes in different studies.</p><p>Nevertheless, the practice of using kidneys from HCV-seropositive donors for transplantation in anti-HCV-positive patients may offer the advantage of shorter waiting times for anti-HCV-positive patients that may outweigh the risk of increased mortality in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/35-37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37,39</a>]. The safety of this approach may be improved, ideally by matching donors and recipients according to the HCV genotypes. Furthermore, the possibility of treating HCV infection with newer, interferon-free regimens after transplantation might provide another argument to support the use of HCV-positive organs, but more studies are clearly needed before definite recommendations can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H757639294\"><span class=\"h2\">Among HCV-negative recipients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, transplantation of kidneys from HCV-infected donors into HCV-negative recipients has not been performed, due to the high risk of HCV transmission (see <a href=\"#H1080135136\" class=\"local\">'Transmission of HCV infection by kidney transplantation'</a> above). As a result, a substantial number of high-quality kidneys from deceased donors with HCV infection are discarded each year. The availability of direct-acting antiviral agents, which are associated with high HCV-cure rates and an acceptable side-effect profile, could potentially reduce waiting times and increase the organ supply by making HCV-infected kidneys available for transplantation.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of transplanting kidneys from HCV-infected donors into HCV-negative recipients were evaluated in a pilot trial of 10 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Donors were limited to those with HCV genotype 1. All patients received induction therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (rATG)-Thymoglobulin and intravenous glucocorticoids, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. An HCV viral load was measured in all recipients on day 3 posttransplant; treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbasvir-and-grazoprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elbasvir-grazoprevir</a> was started upon detection of HCV and continued for 12 weeks. The outcomes were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All recipients tested positive for HCV RNA at day 3 posttransplant and were initiated on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbasvir-and-grazoprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elbasvir-grazoprevir</a>. Following 12 weeks of therapy, all patients had a sustained virologic response (SVR) and were considered cured of HCV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At six months posttransplant, the median serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (97 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and 62.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>,<sup> </sup>respectively.

Additional studies are required to assess longer-term graft and patient outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFICATION OF HCV INFECTION AMONG DONORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to transplantation, the potential donor should be evaluated for evidence of HCV infection by blood tests (including assays for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA according to the United Network for Organ Sharing [UNOS]) and for the risk of HCV infection based on environmental or lifestyle factors. The assessment of risk is required because neither the blood test for anti-HCV antibodies nor HCV RNA is optimal for the identification of HCV infection. The evaluation of the donor for HCV infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> risk is necessary because the risk of HCV transmission to an HCV-negative recipient is high following transplantation of a kidney from an HCV-positive donor, and the recipient must be informed of the risk. While potential recipients may still choose to accept the kidney from an infected donor, the risk of infection must be discussed prior to transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1080135136\" class=\"local\">'Transmission of HCV infection by kidney transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p>The approach to detection of HCV infection or risk of infection varies slightly between deceased and living donors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080134444\"><span class=\"h2\">Deceased donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most organ procurement organizations have a policy for testing all deceased organ donors for evidence of HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/2,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,42</a>]. In the United States, the screening of deceased donors is regulated by the Public Health Service (PHS) through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The PHS issued guidelines for screening deceased donors for HCV in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The screening process includes the identification of criteria that placed the potential donor at increased risk for HCV infection and blood tests that indicate previous or current HCV infection. If risk factors cannot be determined, the deceased potential donor should be considered high risk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The identification of increased-risk criteria</strong> &ndash; This is done though confidential interviews with next of kin, life partner, cohabitant, or primary treating clinician. High-risk criteria are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have had sex with a person known or suspected to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or HCV infection in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Men who have had sex with men (MSM) in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women who have had sex with a man with a history of MSM behavior in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have had sex in exchange for money or drugs in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have had sex with a person who had sex in exchange for money or drugs in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have had sex with a person who injected drugs by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous route for nonmedical reasons in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A child who is less than 18 months of age and born to a mother known to be infected with, or at increased risk for, HIV, HBV, or HCV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A child who has been breastfed within the preceding 12 months and the mother is known to be infected with, or at increased risk for, HIV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have injected drugs by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous route for nonmedical reasons in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have been in lock-up, jail, prison, or a juvenile correctional facility for more than 72 consecutive hours in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have been newly diagnosed with, or have been treated for, syphilis, gonorrhea, <em>Chlamydia</em>, or genital ulcers in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>People who have been on hemodialysis in the preceding 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood tests</strong> &ndash; All deceased donors should be tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and for HCV RNA prior to procurement of the kidney. One can determine the presence of HCV RNA using a variety of tests, which we collectively refer to here as nucleic acid testing (NAT); this terminology is consistent with that used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The antibody test should be made available prior to transplantation. Although the NAT result may not be known prior to transplantation, data may be subsequently used to guide treatment of the recipient. If donor blood is hemodiluted (as among deceased donors who received blood products or crystalloid prior to death), the donor should be considered high risk since the assays are not reliable.</p><p/><p>The organ procurement organization is advised to archive blood samples for at least 10 years. The organ procurement organization should notify both the OPTN and transplant center regarding the identification of increased-risk criteria or evidence of infection.</p><p>Neither the blood test for anti-HCV nor the NAT is optimal for the identification of HCV infection. The antibody or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HCV only detects evidence of prior infection. This test does not indicate whether active transmissible infection is present. In addition, the ELISA may not identify donors who were recently infected (ie, within eight weeks prior to death), since it takes at least eight weeks for detectable antibodies to develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The NAT detects HCV RNA, but generally does not yield a result quickly enough to be useful for the evaluation of deceased donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, concerns have been raised about the lack of standardization of the test between different laboratories and the potential for false-positive and negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/43,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,46</a>]. As noted above, the NAT can be falsely negative in infected, deceased individuals who received blood products or crystalloid just prior to death, or who became infected just before death since HCV first replicates in target cells (ie hepatocytes) before it appears in blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The third-generation anti-HCV tests in donor screening are much more sensitive and specific than earlier tests and minimize the loss of organs due to false-positive results from screening assays for anti-HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Using ELISA3, for example, there was a lower prevalence (3.7 percent) of anti-HCV among cadaver organ donors than the extrapolated prevalence (4.2 percent) of anti-HCV by ELISA2 among cadaver organ donors in the United States.</p><p>If a deceased donor is identified as being at increased risk for or known to have HCV infection, the transplant center team should include this information in discussion of risk with the transplant candidate or medical decision maker. However, HCV-infected donors are not excluded from donation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the use of kidneys from donors with HCV infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1080134451\"><span class=\"h2\">Living donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The screening of living potential donors is closely regulated by <span class=\"nowrap\">PHS/OPTN</span> in the United States.

(See <a href=\"#H1080134444\" class=\"local\">'Deceased donors'</a> above.)</p><p>All living-donor candidates should be tested for anti-HCV antibodies and for HCV RNA by NAT. The tests should be performed at least within 28 days prior to surgery and as close to the time of surgery as possible. If an HCV-infected donor is identified, the transplant center should be notified and risk discussed with the potential recipient. If a kidney from an HCV-infected donor is used, OPTN should be notified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE USE OF KIDNEYS FROM DONORS WITH HCV INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1574740963\"><span class=\"h2\">Deceased donors with HCV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to accept a kidney from a donor that is at high risk for or has evidence of HCV infection depends on many recipient-related variables. These variables include recipient HCV status, the anticipated time on the waiting list, and morbidity conferred by dialysis.</p><p>We agree with the 2008 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines that kidneys from anti-HCV-positive donors should be given to only HCV RNA-positive recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. We suggest that HCV-negative recipients not be offered donor kidneys from high-risk deceased potential donors, even if the potential donor is anti-HCV negative; this is because the anti-HCV may be negative in the acute phase of infection or in immunocompromised individuals and since nucleic acid testing (NAT) is rarely available prior to transplantation. Furthermore, the risk of transmission of infections like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also remains. However, in view of data showing the safety of transplanting kidneys from high-risk donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], as well as the approval of safe and effective interferon-free therapy to treat HCV infection after transplantation, the use of kidneys from such donors may be considered in uninfected patients in cases of urgent medical need where the benefit is deemed to outweigh the risks. In all such cases, the recipient should receive specific counseling, be well informed, and participate in decision making.</p><p>In 2011, more than 1210 organ transplants were reported from donors who were positive for HCV <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis B virus (HBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Of these, 539 were transplanted into recipients known to be infected and 121 into recipients known to be uninfected. The infectious status of 550 recipients was not known.</p><p>The presence of HCV-related kidney disease among HCV-positive donors is generally excluded by an evaluation of renal function, urinalysis for detection of hematuria, and assessment of proteinuria. Although clinically silent immune-complex glomerulonephritis has been detected in patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCV-induced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], we are not aware of any report suggesting clinically silent glomerular disease in hepatitis C-positive subjects in the absence of any liver or known kidney disease (ie, in autopsies), nor in any biopsy studies of hepatitis C-positive donor kidneys at the time of transplantation. Among deceased potential donors, pretransplant (preimplantation) biopsy of deceased-donor kidneys can be used to evaluate the quality of the hepatitis C-positive donor kidney and to exclude pre-existing renal disease. However, it should be kept in mind that frozen sections are not reliable for assessment of mesangial cellularity, glomerular capillary wall thickening, and microthrombi. Fixation of the biopsy specimen in formalin followed by paraffin sectioning overcomes the limitations of frozen sections but typically takes four to five hours. The benefits of biopsy-guided decision making must therefore be balanced against the risks emanating from increased cold ischemic time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1574740991\"><span class=\"h2\">Living donors with HCV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not known whether a kidney from an HCV-infected donor who has been treated with an effective antiviral regimen may be safely transplanted into an HCV-negative recipient or into an HCV-positive recipient with a different HCV genotype. One case of transplantation to an HCV-negative recipient has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>The rationale underlying this approach is that HCV infection may be effectively treated in only 8 to 12 weeks, depending on the HCV genotype, treatment experience, and extent of the underlying liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 2 and 3 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-4-5-and-6-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 4, 5, and 6 infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Successful HCV treatment results in sustained virologic response (SVR), which is defined as the continued absence of detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after completion of therapy, and is considered a marker for cure of HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In view of the high SVR rates and the short duration of the HCV therapies, it may be worthwhile to delay kidney transplantation to cure an HCV-positive donor. Among HCV-positive recipients, this potentially would avoid superinfection with another genotype.</p><p>However, there is a small chance for transmission of HCV to an HCV-negative recipient with transplantation of a kidney from a treated HCV-positive donor. This could occur if there is false-negative HCV RNA testing of the donor, especially after a short follow-up (ie, 12 weeks) or in the case of &quot;occult hepatitis C infection.&quot; However, occult hepatitis C infection may have no clinical relevance, and data on the possibility of transmission are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2025433886\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

HCV infection has been associated with increased morbidity and possibly mortality in kidney transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1080135457\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of transplantation of HCV-positive kidney'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although recipients of kidneys from HCV-infected donors have worse outcomes compared with those who receive kidneys from non-HCV-infected donors, they have better outcomes compared with individuals who remain on the kidney transplant waiting list. (See <a href=\"#H1080135457\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of transplantation of HCV-positive kidney'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using kidneys from HCV-seropositive donors for transplantation in anti-HCV-positive patients may be a safe approach in the long-term as the risk of increased mortality is likely overweighed by the survival benefit conferred by shorter waiting times. (See <a href=\"#H1080135829\" class=\"local\">'Among HCV-positive recipients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to transplantation, the potential donor should be evaluated for evidence of HCV infection and for the risk of HCV infection based on environmental or lifestyle factors. The assessment of risk is required because the blood tests may be falsely negative in some donors. The potential recipient must be informed of the donor HCV status and the potential risk of infection prior to transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Identification of HCV infection among donors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most organ procurement organizations have a policy for testing all deceased and living potential organ donors for evidence of HCV infection. In the United States, there are mandated guidelines for screening deceased donors for HCV risk. If risk factors cannot be determined, the deceased potential donor should be considered high risk. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Identification of HCV infection among donors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with the 2008 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines that kidneys from anti-HCV-positive deceased donors should be given to only HCV RNA-positive recipients (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the use of kidneys from donors with HCV infection'</a> above). In cases of HCV-positive living donors for HCV-positive recipients, the risks of delaying transplantation for the antiviral treatment should be weighed against the benefits.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1574741202\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Svetlozar Natov, MD, and Brian JG Pereira, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-in-kidney-donors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pereira BJ, Milford EL, Kirkman RL, Levey AS.
