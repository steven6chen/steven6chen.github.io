HDV is a defective virus requiring the simultaneous presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to fully express its pathogenicity; thus, hepatitis D always occurs in the presence of HBV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most cases of HDV infection, HBV replication is suppressed to low levels by HDV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Liver damage in these patients is essentially due to HDV only. Occasionally, HBV and HDV replicate simultaneously, each virus contributing to the liver damage, thereby resulting in more severe liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE OF HDV INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical course is influenced by several factors, including the HDV genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere but a brief review is warranted to provide the rationale for antiviral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The predominant genotype in the Western world is genotype I. Once chronic HDV infection is established, it usually exacerbates the preexisting liver disease due to HBV. Progression towards cirrhosis may be rapid, but does not occur in all patients. HDV-associated chronic liver disease may run an indolent course and asymptomatic HDV carriers have been found in some geographical areas.</p><p>Patients who are currently referred for HDV infection appear to represent cohorts infected many years ago in whom the HDV-related disease rapidly developed to cirrhosis, but whose subsequent disease progression has been slow. This was illustrated in a report from Italy in which the estimated 5- and 10-year probability of survival free of liver transplantation in patients who had already developed clinically overt cirrhosis was 49 and 40 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A more ominous course toward liver decompensation has been documented in patients with active HBV and HDV replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the Far East, where the predominant genotype is genotype II, there is a less frequent association of chronic HDV infection with progressive liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">AIMS OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aim of treatment of hepatitis D is to eradicate or to achieve long-term suppression of both HDV and HBV.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary endpoint of treatment is the suppression of HDV replication, which is accompanied by normalization of the serum aminotransferase (ALT) level and amelioration of necroinflammatory activity on liver biopsy. Suppression of HDV replication is documented by loss of detectable HDV RNA in serum and of HDAg in the liver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A secondary endpoint is the eradication of HBV infection, with HBsAg to anti-HBs seroconversion. There is very little information to support that current treatment is effective in achieving this goal. Eradication of HBV infection with development of anti-HBs will protect the individual from reinfection with HBV as well as HDV. Patients who have cleared HDV but who remain HBsAg positive are still at risk of reinfection with HDV. This phenomenon has been observed in chimpanzees. However, reexposure to HDV appears to cause only a mild and self-limiting hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIALS OF INTERFERON ALFA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only drug approved at present for treatment of chronic hepatitis D is interferon alfa (IFNa). Peginterferon appears to be more effective than standard interferon, but data are limited. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients treated with interferon clear HDV infection. A meta-analysis of five trials comparing interferon with observation (including a total of 169 participants) concluded that there was a modest benefit in suppressing viral and liver disease activity in some patients, but such benefits were not sustained in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of action of IFNa in hepatitis D is unclear. IFNa does not have any antiviral activity against HDV when tested in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Thus, the efficacy of IFNa in patients with chronic hepatitis D may depend upon its antiviral effects on the helper virus (HBV) or its immunomodulatory effects. Interestingly, in vitro studies have found that HDV subverts the effect of IFNa signaling, possibly contributing to viral persistence and treatment resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-and-pegylated-interferon-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard and pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Trials of standard interferon therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absolute number of reported patients with chronic hepatitis D who have been treated with standard IFNa is small and the available data have shown mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>].</p><p>Eradication of HDV infection and resolution of liver disease after IFNa treatment have been reported anecdotally in uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In one of these reports, long-term therapy with high doses of IFNa permanently suppressed HDV replication in some patients and dramatically improved liver fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the favorable effects of IFNa have not been confirmed in all controlled trials.</p><p>In the largest multicenter trial, 61 Italian patients with chronic hepatitis D were randomly assigned to receive IFNa in doses of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">MU/m2</span> three times weekly for four months, followed by 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">MU/m2</span> three times weekly for an additional eight months, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. They were then followed for another 12 months. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight (25 percent) of the 31 treated patients had a normal serum ALT level versus none of the 30 controls at the end of the 12-month treatment period. However, all but one of the responders had biochemical relapse after discontinuation of therapy. Only one patient had a normal ALT level at the end of the follow-up period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourteen (45 percent) treated patients were HDV RNA-negative at the end of treatment; however, a similar proportion (27 percent) of controls also became HDV RNA-negative, suggesting that spontaneous fluctuations in HDV viremia may occur. The frequency of undetectable HDV-RNA at the end of the follow-up period was not significantly different (45 versus 33 percent with placebo). The only patient with persistently normal ALT level was also HDV RNA-negative at the end of the follow-up period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvement in liver histology at the end of therapy occurred with similar frequency in the two groups (57 versus 36 percent, p = NS).</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that IFNa therapy did not produce any appreciable benefit in patients with chronic hepatitis D.</p><p>In another smaller Italian study, 42 patients with chronic hepatitis D were randomly assigned to receive two different doses (9 versus 3 MU three times weekly) of IFNa for 48 weeks or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal serum ALT levels at the end of treatment occurred more frequently in the patients receiving 9 MU doses of IFNa than in the other two groups (70, 29, and 8 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response (normal ALT level and undetectable serum HDV RNA at the end of treatment) was also more frequent with 9 MU dosing (50, 21, and 0 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with 9 MU doses of IFNa was also associated with a marked improvement in liver histology. Five of the 10 responders in the 9 MU dose group had normal ALT levels that lasted for up to four years. However, none of the patients had sustained clearance of HDV RNA.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that high-dose interferon was effective in suppressing HDV replication but that the antiviral effect was not sustained. Furthermore, in a follow-up report they found that ALT normalization correlated with improved hepatic function and loss of IgM anti-HDV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Compared to treatment with low-dose interferon or placebo, those who received high doses of IFNa were more likely to have clearance of HDV RNA and HBV DNA as well as improvement in histologic activity and fibrosis (including reversal of cirrhosis in some patients).</p><p>However, these optimistic conclusions have not been confirmed by another randomized, controlled trial performed in Italy that used a similarly aggressive regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The reasons for these discrepant findings are unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Factors predicting response to standard IFNa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the poor overall response, it is difficult to identify factors that predict response. The only feature that may be associated with an increased likelihood of response is a short duration of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/11,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Peginterferon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little published experience with peginterferon in the treatment of chronic hepatitis D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The largest published study included 38 patients who were treated with pegylated IFN alfa-2b (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">MU/kg</span> per week) alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> for 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most patients had previously failed treatment with standard IFN. All patients were maintained on pegylated IFN for an additional 24 weeks, and then followed off therapy for 24 weeks. At the end of follow-up, HDV RNA was undetectable in eight patients (21 percent). Treatment had to be discontinued in 25 percent of patients while 58 percent required dose modification. The response rate was similar in the monotherapy and combination therapy groups suggesting that ribavirin had no effect on the viral clearance rate. The response rate was somewhat higher in a subset of patients who had not previously received interferon-based therapy (three of eight patients).</p><p>A higher virologic response rate (43 percent) was found in another study involving 14 patients treated with 12 months of pegylated IFN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The higher response rate may have been due to a lower proportion of patients with cirrhosis in the second study (28 versus 74 percent).</p><p>Several studies have tried to evaluate the appropriate duration of treatment among patients receiving pegylated IFN.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 18 patients with chronic HDV infection were randomly assigned to receive 12 versus 24 months of pegylated IFN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Extending the treatment duration to 24 months did not increase the likelihood of achieving HDV-RNA suppression. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study followed 104 patients with chronic HDV who received 48 weeks of treatment with pegylated IFN. Patients with a detectable serum HDV RNA after 24 weeks of therapy were unlikely to have a sustained virologic response after treatment was stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>However, certain patients may benefit from prolonged therapy if eradication of HBsAg is used as an endpoint (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Aims of treatment'</a> above). In a case series of four patients receiving pegylated IFN, treatment was continued until the HBsAg titer was not detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most patients required prolonged treatment (ranging from seven months to four years) to achieve a negative HBsAg value. The HBsAg remained negative in all patients 12 months after the end of therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Peginterferon plus adefovir dipivoxil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have evaluated combination therapy for HDV using nucleoside analogues. One of the largest controlled trials included 90 patients with compensated chronic hepatitis D who were randomly assigned to peginterferon alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a>, or adefovir monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. After 48 weeks, HDV RNA was negative in approximately 25 percent of patients in both peginterferon arms and none in the adefovir monotherapy arm. The response was sustained up to 24 weeks after stopping therapy. Thus, combination therapy appeared to offer no advantage to peginterferon monotherapy, while adefovir monotherapy was ineffective. A significant decline in HBsAg levels was observed in patients receiving peginterferon (especially when combined with adefovir) but not in patients treated with adefovir monotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3218302165\"><span class=\"h2\">HBV nucleotide inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is a logical approach to target HBV in its capacity as an HDV helper virus. Although earlier studies were discouraging, a small retrospective series found that all 19 patients coinfected with HIV, HBV, and HDV had undetectable HBV RNA and 10 (53 percent) had undetectable HDV RNA, after a median duration of 58 months of tenofovir treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, HBsAg seroclearance occurred in three patients. Thus, it is possible that long-term inhibition of HBV replication may also result in the suppression of HDV replication. These results should be confirmed in other studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several drugs have been evaluated as alternatives to interferon (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>). Many of these agents were used to treat other infections and were thought to have activity against hepatitis D virus (HDV) based upon in vitro studies or small case reports. However, results in larger human studies were discouraging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/19,27-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27-36</a>]. Newer agents that have novel mechanisms of action show more promise. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific inhibitors of HDV prenylation &minus; &quot;Prenylation&quot; involves the covalent addition of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid molecule to a conserved cysteine residue at or near the C-terminus of a protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This link promotes membrane interactions with the prenylated protein since the isoprenoid chain is hydrophobic.

FTI-277 and another agent, FTI-2153, were effective in clearing HDV viremia in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lonafarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor used to treat other diseases (eg, progeria), was evaluated in a phase 2a study of 14 patients with HDV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A 200 mg dose of lonafarnib, given twice daily for 28 days, resulted in an average serum HDV RNA decline of 1.54 log <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span>.

Myrcludex B was administered to 14 individuals, either as monotherapy (2 mg subcutaneously given daily) or in combination with pegylated interferon (IFN) for 24 weeks. Myrcludex B was well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination with pegylated IFN. Of the 14 patients who received Myrcludex B, 13 experienced a &gt;1 Log<sub>10</sub> reduction in HDV RNA after 24 weeks of therapy.

These data showed for the first time that partial protection against HDV superinfection could be achieved by active immunization.</p><p>A similar study used the short form of HDAg expressed by recombinant baculovirus or vaccinia virus as immunogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Again, after challenge of the woodchucks with HDV, partial protection was observed even though anti-HDV was not detected. It is possible that the protection was related to induction of cytotoxic T-cell response.</p><p>However, these encouraging results were not confirmed by other investigators who used live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing either the small or the large form of HDAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The explanations for the different outcomes using vaccines that are manufactured by very similar approaches are unknown.</p><p>In another approach, three synthetic HDAg peptides were administered to four woodchucks, resulting in the production of specific antibodies. These woodchucks developed transient, low-level viremia after inoculation with HDV but none developed chronic HDV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Thus, partial protection of HBsAg carriers from HDV infection through active immunization is feasible. The woodchucks serve as a useful animal model for evaluating HDV vaccines. However, worldwide implementation of a vaccination policy against HDV would probably prove too costly and impractical due to the need to screen for HBsAg carriers. Vaccination against HBV remains the most cost effective means to prevent HDV infection, except for individuals who are already infected with HBV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the rate of success is low, we suggest that patients with chronic hepatitis D and active liver disease, as evidenced by elevated ALT levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic hepatitis on liver biopsy be treated and treated early, particularly if there is advanced fibrosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This is based upon the observation that chronic hepatitis D can be a severe liver disease, and that response is more likely to be attained in patients with a short duration of infection. Asymptomatic HDV carriers with normal ALT levels do not require therapy but should be monitored for signs of active disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Aims of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal treatment of HDV is uncertain. Thus, patients should ideally be treated as part of a clinical trial. As noted above, the only treatment approved for chronic HDV is interferon alfa. Before the availability of peginterferon, the recommended dose regimen was standard IFNa 9 MU three times weekly for at least 12 months, although longer treatment had been advocated. However, in light of emerging data, we suggest pegylated IFNa replace standard IFNa as the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis D (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment should be administered for one year; whether longer duration of treatment will improve response rates remains to be established. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Peginterferon'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available data have not demonstrated an advantage from the addition of a <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleos/tide</span> analogue. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Experimental treatments'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Krogsgaard K, Kryger P, Aldershvile J, et al.
