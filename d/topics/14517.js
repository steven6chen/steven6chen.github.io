In normal pregnancy, urinary protein excretion increases substantially; hence, total protein excretion is considered abnormal in pregnant women when it exceeds 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Proteinuria is one of the cardinal features of preeclampsia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 1</a>), a common and potentially severe complication of pregnancy. However, two important points should be noted. First, the severity of proteinuria is only weakly associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and severe proteinuria is no longer considered a mandatory diagnostic feature of preeclampsia with severe features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. However, some studies report heavy proteinuria (&gt;3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> is associated with earlier gestational age at preeclampsia onset, earlier gestational age at delivery, and a higher incidence of fetal growth restriction as compared with milder degrees of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Second, proteinuria may be absent: Up to 10 percent of women with clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histological manifestations of preeclampsia and 20 percent of women with eclampsia have no proteinuria at the time of initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These observations are reflected in the 2013 American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy recommendations, which no longer require proteinuria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia if other severe preeclampsia features are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although less prevalent, primary renal disease and renal disease secondary to systemic disorders, such as diabetes or primary hypertension, are usually characterized by proteinuria and may first present in pregnancy. To further complicate this picture, 20 to 25 percent of women with chronic hypertension and diabetes develop superimposed preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>It is important for clinicians caring for pregnant women to understand how to identify proteinuria, and how to determine whether preeclampsia or renal disease (or both) is the cause. This topic will discuss the approach to the evaluation of pregnant women with proteinuria and management of nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy. The evaluation of proteinuria in nonpregnant individuals and measurement of protein excretion are discussed in detail separately.

Urinary protein excretion increases substantially due to a combination of increased GFR and increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additionally, tubular reabsorption of filtered protein is reduced in pregnancy, along with other nonelectrolytes, such as amino acids, glucose, and beta-microglobulin.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2249146845\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p>Standard urine dipstick testing is commonly performed on a fresh, clean voided, midstream urine specimen obtained before pelvic examination to minimize the chance of contamination from vaginal secretions. The urinary dipstick for protein is a semi-quantitative colorimetric test that primarily detects albumin. Results range from negative to 4+, corresponding to the following estimates of protein excretion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trace - between 15 and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1+ - between 30 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2+ - between 100 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3+ - between 300 and 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4+ - &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p/><p>A positive reaction (+1) for protein develops at the threshold concentration of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> which roughly corresponds to a 24-hour urinary protein excretion of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> depending on urine volume.</p><p>Although inexpensive and commonly used, the urinary dipstick has a high false-positive and false-negative rate when used to screen for abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy, especially at the 1+ level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This is due primarily to variability in urine concentration (osmolality), which can substantially affect random urine protein concentration (ie, the dipstick result) even though there is no change in total daily urinary protein excretion.</p><p>False positive tests may occur in the presence of gross (macroscopic) blood in the urine, semen, very alkaline urine (pH &gt;7), quaternary ammonium compounds, detergents and disinfectants, drugs, radio-contrast agents, and high specific gravity (&gt;1.030). Positive tests for protein due to blood in the urine seldom exceed 1+ by dipstick. False negatives may occur with low specific gravity (&lt;1.010), high salt concentration, highly acidic urine, or with nonalbumin proteinuria. False-negative urine dipstick proteinuria testing is most common in the third trimester of pregnancy, when preeclampsia is most frequently seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">QUANTIFYING PROTEIN EXCRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary protein can be measured as either albumin or total protein. Non-pregnant women normally excrete less than 30 mg of albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and less than 150 mg of total protein daily. In normal pregnancy, total protein excretion increases to 150 to 250 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and is even higher in twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>Accurate quantification of proteinuria in pregnancy is important in several clinical settings. If preeclampsia is suspected, proteinuria quantification is helpful, though not required, for diagnosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>). In women with pre-existing proteinuria, a large gestational increase in proteinuria can herald superimposed preeclampsia. In women with chronic kidney disease, proteinuria &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (odds ratio 3.69; 95% CI 1.63-8.36), including preterm delivery, small for gestational age infants, and need for neonatal intensive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In women with chronic hypertension, even mild proteinuria (50 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There are three methods to quantify proteinuria: 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein:creatinine ratio, and spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">24-hour urine collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional method requires a 24-hour urine collection to directly determine the daily total protein or albumin excretion. An extra benefit of this approach, if creatinine is also measured, is that it provides the information necessary to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the creatinine clearance. The 24-hour collection is begun at the usual time the patient awakens. At that time, the first void is discarded and the exact time noted. Subsequently, all urine voids are collected with the last void timed to finish the collection at exactly the same time the next morning. The time of the final urine specimen should vary by no more than 5 or 10 minutes from the time of starting the collection the previous morning. An inexpensive basin urinal that fits into the toilet bowl facilitates collection. The bottle(s) may be kept at normal room temperature for a day or two, but should be kept cool or refrigerated for longer periods of time. No preservatives are needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although generally considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis of proteinuria in both preeclampsia and renal disease, the 24-hour urine protein excretion in pregnant women is frequently inaccurate due to undercollection or overcollection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, when interpreting the results of a 24-hour urine collection, it is critical to assess the adequacy of collection by quantifying the 24-hour urine creatinine excretion, which is based on muscle mass. The 24-hour urine creatinine excretion should be between 15 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight, calculated using pre-pregnancy weight. Values substantially above or below this estimate suggest over- and undercollection, respectively, and should call into question the accuracy of the 24-hour urine protein result.</p><p>In addition to the high rate of <span class=\"nowrap\">inaccurate/incomplete</span> collection, the 24-hour urine sample is cumbersome for ambulatory patients, and the result is not available for at least 24 hours while the collection is being completed and analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Hence, there has been longstanding interest in alternative methods to quantify urine protein excretion in pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine protein to creatinine ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PC ratio) has become the preferred method for the quantification of proteinuria in the non-pregnant population due to high accuracy, reproducibility, and convenience when compared to timed urine collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of studies evaluating the urine PC ratio in pregnant women were performed in women with suspected preeclampsia. In these studies, the PC ratio was highly correlated with the 24-hour urine protein measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], as it is in non-pregnant adults. Use of the PC ratio has also been validated for baseline proteinuria quantification in early pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Routine bladder catheterization for measurement of urine PC ratio is not necessary; mid-stream clean-catch samples are accurate in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The time of day of urine specimen collection does not impact accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Over a dozen studies have validated the urine PC ratio for the detection of abnormal proteinuria in women with hypertensive pregnancy; most used the 24-hour urine collection as the &quot;gold standard&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/26,30-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30-42</a>]. Most studies have focused on accurate determination of greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of proteinuria, as this is the cut-off for preeclampsia diagnosis. Three systematic reviews have evaluated this literature, and came to similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2012 meta-analysis including 2978 women from 20 studies, spot urine ratio had a pooled sensitivity of 83.6 percent (95% CI 77.5-89.7) and specificity of 76.3 percent (95% CI 72.6-80.0) using a cut-off of 0.26 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine to predict proteinuria &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> by 24-hour urine collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The authors concluded that a low spot protein:creatinine ratio is a reasonable &quot;rule-out&quot; test for excluding proteinuria &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in hypertensive pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2008 meta-analysis including 1717 women from seven studies, a lower cut-off of 0.13 to 0.15 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine provided higher (90 to 99 percent) sensitivity, albeit with more false-positive results (specificity 33 to 65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A higher cutoff of 0.6 to 0.7 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine had a high specificity (96 percent) for significant proteinuria (&gt;300 mg in a 24-hour specimen), but at the cost of lower sensitivity (85 to 87 percent). Midrange <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> ratios (greater than 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mg</span> but less than 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mg)</span> did not reliably predict abnormal proteinuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another 2012 meta-analysis, including 2790 women from 15 studies, had similar findings. A single diagnostic threshold of approximately 0.30 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine had sensitivity and specificity of 81 and 76 percent, respectively, for the detection of &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> proteinuria by 24-hour urine collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A lower cut-off (0.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mg)</span> had better (89 percent) sensitivity for the exclusion of proteinuria. </p><p/><p>Taken together, these data suggest that a urine PC ratio above 0.7 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine strongly predicts significant proteinuria. A urine PC ratio less than 0.15 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine can be considered normal (predictive of less than 300 mg protein in a 24-hour collection). Confirmatory testing with 24-hour urine collection probably is not necessary in these individuals. Women with urine PC ratio results between 0.15 and 0.7 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine should have a 24-hour urine collection to accurately quantify proteinuria. Most international organizations endorse the use of the spot urine protein:creatinine ratio &ge;0.26 to 0.3 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/mg</span> creatinine for the diagnosis of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Some laboratories and international guidelines use urine protein:creatinine ratio in units of mg protein per mmol creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/mmol)</span>.

Like the PC ratio, the ACR (using a threshold between 20 and 60 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/g</span> creatinine) is strongly predictive of significant proteinuria (&gt;300 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/day</span> by 24-hour urine collection) in a high-risk obstetric antenatal clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/40,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,49</a>] and in women with hypertensive pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In one study, women with a spot urine ACR &gt;312 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/g</span> creatinine measured at 17 to 20 weeks of gestation were at almost eightfold higher risk of subsequently developing preeclampsia (relative risk [RR] 7.8) compared with women with ACR &lt;312 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/g</span> creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

In patients with established renal disease before conception or in whom proteinuria is documented before the 20th week of gestation, the diagnosis of pre-existing renal disease can be readily made because preeclampsia rarely occurs before that time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conversely, new-onset proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation suggests preeclampsia. Approximately one-third of women who present with new proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation eventually progress to preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>], and 25 percent of women with preeclampsia have proteinuria as their initial presenting sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In such cases, adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are more common as compared with women in whom hypertension was the first presenting sign of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. </p><p>Of course, de novo renal disease (for example, lupus nephritis) can also occur later in pregnancy. Especially when information on the presence of proteinuria (and hypertension) in early pregnancy is lacking, distinguishing between underlying renal disease and preeclampsia can be difficult. For this reason, it is useful to quantify protein excretion in early pregnancy in women at risk for underlying renal disease (ie, women with chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and systemic lupus erythematosus). Diagnostic evaluation in women when the etiology of proteinuria is unclear should include renal ultrasound, as urinary tract dilatation has been associated with proteinuria in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>A novel serum test for early diagnosis of preeclampsia has been developed, which relies on detection of abnormal levels of placentally-derived angiogenic factors, sFlt1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1) and PlGF (placental growth factor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. This diagnostic test is available in Europe (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland and Thermo <span class=\"nowrap\">Fisher/Brahms,</span> Hennigsdorf, Germany) and is being evaluated by the FDA for use in the United States. Although more studies are needed to validate its use, this blood test may prove useful and cost-effective in distinguishing preeclampsia from other causes of proteinuria in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>], and appears to be predictive of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with clinical suspicion of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. The sFlt1:PlGF ratio may be particularly helpful in distinguishing chronic kidney disease and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-pathogenesis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'sFlt-1, VEGF, PlGF'</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between renal disease and preeclampsia is important because it affects clinical management. In patients with renal disease, the usual aim is term delivery, while patients with preeclampsia often develop progressive disease culminating in the need for iatrogenic preterm delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In instances where the distinction between renal disease and preeclampsia cannot be resolved, it is prudent to assume preeclampsia as the working diagnosis, as it has the potential for rapid development of serious maternal and fetal complications.</p><p>In some cases, the distinction between renal disease and preeclampsia can only be made in retrospect, as clinical signs of preeclampsia generally resolve within 12 weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], while proteinuria due to underlying renal disease does not. However, resolution of proteinuria after preeclampsia, especially when severe, can sometimes take much longer. In one cohort study of 205 women with preeclampsia, 14 percent had persistent proteinuria at 12 weeks after delivery, which resolved by two years postpartum in all but 2 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Nevertheless, proteinuria (or hypertension) which persists longer than three months after delivery should prompt close follow-up and consideration of further evaluation and appropriate referral, so that underlying renal disease or chronic hypertension is detected and treated expeditiously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Superimposed preeclampsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When preeclampsia develops in women with preexisting renal disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension, it often occurs earlier in gestation and may be particularly severe. In such cases, significant clues to the diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia can be provided by the systemic manifestations of the disorder, if present, such as thrombocytopenia, an increase in levels of liver enzymes, hemolysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of fetal compromise (including intrauterine growth restriction) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60502 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, worsening hypertension and proteinuria in a woman with renal disease may represent an exacerbation of the underlying disease. Studies in women with documented primary renal disease predating pregnancy have demonstrated that the majority of women with glomerular disease exhibit increasing proteinuria during the course of their gestation and nephrotic syndrome in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis for hypertension and proteinuria in pregnancy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1350842828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrotic-range proteinuria (&gt;3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours) is a sign of glomerular injury. Pathology limited to the renal tubules and interstitium typically results in protein excretion rates less than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours unless glomerular disease is also present. Patients with protein excretion less than 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours are usually asymptomatic. In contrast, rates greater than 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours may cause the nephrotic syndrome, which consists of nephrotic-range proteinuria together with edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449434937\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney biopsy in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preeclampsia is the most common cause of de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria in pregnancy, and rarely requires kidney biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. However, the nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy may also be caused by preexisting renal disease (which is often accompanied by a large increase in proteinuria during pregnancy), and de novo renal disease that presents during pregnancy (eg, associated with invasive trophoblastic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]). Once it has been determined that the patient has heavy proteinuria, the etiology may be suggested from the history and physical examination. This is particularly true for patients who have a systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, HIV infection, or use of a medication known to cause nephrotic syndrome (NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, interferon-alpha). In some cases, however, renal biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis. The decision to perform renal biopsy during pregnancy, or to defer until after delivery, is based on several factors, including the stage of pregnancy, the severity of the renal disease, and the suspected underlying diagnosis.</p><p>Nephrotic range proteinuria during pregnancy due to primary glomerular disease is associated with a high risk of several adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia, acute kidney injury, preterm birth, low birthweight, and the need for neonatal intensive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Nevertheless, conservative management until delivery, particularly in patients who present in the third trimester, is a reasonable management approach. When nephrotic syndrome presents early in pregnancy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is progressive decline in renal function, timely treatment of the underlying kidney disease is often indicated. In such cases, the potential benefits of kidney biopsy may outweigh the risks.</p><p>Data on the safety of renal biopsy during pregnancy are limited. The major complication of kidney biopsy is bleeding. In a systematic review of reports of renal biopsies performed during pregnancy or postpartum, the risk of bleeding was higher when the biopsy was performed during pregnancy as compared with postpartum (7 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[16/197]</span> versus 1 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[3/268])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. All observed cases of major bleeding (ie, requiring blood transfusion) occurred in biopsies performed between 23 to 26 weeks of gestation, suggesting women in this gestational age range may be particularly vulnerable to complications. During this gestational window, however, the benefit of a biopsy (accurate diagnosis and subsequent tailored management) may outweigh its risks. Later in gestation, the gravid uterus makes the standard prone position difficult. In such cases, renal biopsy is frequently deferred until the patient has stabilized postpartum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5992575\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF NEPHROTIC SYNDROME IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of the nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy is based on expert opinion, as very little data are available to support evidence-based practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5992588\"><span class=\"h2\">Edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major goal in the management of nephrotic syndrome is to reduce edema to a level that allows comfort during ambulation. The dietary intake of sodium may be limited to 1.5 g (approximately 60 mEq) of sodium per day, provided normal blood pressure is maintained. Bed rest and leg elevation are safe and often effective methods to facilitate resolution of edema.</p><p>Historically, the use of diuretics has been discouraged because of the theoretical risk that they will impair the normal pregnancy-associated expansion of plasma volume, possibly decreasing placental perfusion. However, there is no clear evidence of adverse fetal effects, and loop diuretics are appropriate in pregnant women with severe, refractory edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In such cases, therapy should aim to reduce excessive edema at a slow rate of no more than 1 to 2 pounds per day with a loop diuretic, while a low sodium diet is maintained. A written record of daily weights, taken by the patient, is highly recommended. Diuretics should not be used in preeclampsia because plasma volume is already reduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5992598\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrotic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Routine prophylactic anticoagulation in severe nephrotic syndrome (ie, serum albumin &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> is controversial, and generally recommended only if another risk factor for thrombosis is present (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>). Since pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, we believe prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered in pregnant women with nephrotic syndrome and severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> or &lt;2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in membranous nephropathy), especially if another risk factor (eg, bedrest) is present. However, this decision needs to be made on a case-by-case basis with consideration of the patient&rsquo;s specific risk factors for bleeding complications, including pregnancy-related bleeding.</p><p>Low-molecular weight heparin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> is appropriate for prophylactic anticoagulation in pregnancy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> should be avoided during pregnancy because it crosses the placenta and can have adverse fetal effects, but can be used postpartum, even in breastfeeding women. Anticoagulation should be continued in the immediate postpartum period, particularly in women undergoing cesarean delivery, as this period carries a particularly high risk for DVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Ratios between 0.15 and 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mg</span> should be further evaluated by 24-hour urine collection. If a 24 hour urine collection is not obtained, a protein:creatinine ratio of 0.26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mg</span> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol)</span> in a random urine sample is suggested as the threshold for significant proteinuria.
