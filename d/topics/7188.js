However, the specific etiologic and pathogenic elements of this disorder are not fully understood. Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic and diffuse musculoskeletal pain, severe fatigue, and nonrestorative sleep. Initially described in adults, this disorder was subsequently described in children and adolescents and is often referred to as juvenile primary fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates clinicians, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists and that offers a combination of pharmacologic, cognitive-behavioral, and physical interventions, along with patient education, is most effective in treating patients with fibromyalgia. A stepwise approach to management is taken, starting with psychologic and physical interventions. Medications may be added, particularly for treating certain aspects of fibromyalgia such as depression and anxiety, sleep disturbances, and pain.</p><p>The treatment of fibromyalgia in children and adolescents is reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in children and the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease in adults are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H846193375\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Well-controlled clinical trials indicate that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing functional disability and symptoms of depression in adolescents with juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Critical elements of treatment include physical exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and cognitive-behavioral strategies to enhance coping and self-regulation of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In our practice, management of a child with fibromyalgia includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy starts with confirmation of the diagnosis by a clinician experienced in treating juvenile fibromyalgia. The disease is then reviewed with the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family, including its chronic but generally nonprogressive nature. If there are other disorders present (eg, depression, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, chronic headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, or other causes of musculoskeletal pain such as hypermobility syndrome), these should be identified and treated as well. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Education'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-impact aerobic activities, such as biking, swimming, or water aerobic exercises, are begun and individualized to meet each patient's needs. The level of activities should initially be set at a low level because most patients have become physically deconditioned and many have increased pain and low tolerance for exercise. It is important to emphasize the necessity of doing regular, daily aerobic exercise to achieve the most benefit. A course of physical therapy with gradual cardiovascular fitness training may help children and adolescents to develop the optimal activity regimen. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is referred for CBT, which is most effective if combined with an ongoing exercise program. Treatment should include behavioral interventions to establish more adaptive behavioral routines, including returning to school, facilitating coping and problem-solving strategies, and learning self-regulatory techniques to improve pain modulation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Psychologic interventions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following pharmacologic interventions are options for patients who have not responded to the above measures:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antiepileptic agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, particularly in patients who are inadequately controlled with or are intolerant of antidepressants. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'GABA agonists'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a> (dose of 20 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> or use of dual selective norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> (initial dose 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a> (50 to 100 mg twice a day). It should be noted that, for adolescents and children, there is a boxed warning for SSRIs and SNRIs because some patients have experienced a worsening of depression with suicidal ideation and behavior. Pediatric patients on these medications should be carefully monitored for this complication. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tricyclic antidepressants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amitriptyline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nortriptyline</a> in low doses (10 to 50 mg at bedtime), when difficulty initiating sleep is the primary concern. These agents are also potentially helpful in reducing the symptoms of chronic musculoskeletal pain, headaches, and irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial and sometimes most important therapy for patients with fibromyalgia is to provide them with a diagnosis, education about their illness, and structure for living their life with this chronic disorder. Simply having an actual diagnosis, after months and sometimes years of symptoms and many doctors' visits without a clear answer, is often of help to the patient and family in terms of beginning to understand and cope with the illness.</p><p>Education and advice on specific areas include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep regimen - Because of the prevalence of sleep disturbances in these children, it is important to establish a routine sleep regimen with regular times for waking and going to bed. Caffeine should be avoided, especially from the late afternoon hours onward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School attendance - For children who have avoided school, efforts should be directed towards a return to attending school on a regular basis. Full-time school attendance with minimal accommodations is the ultimate goal, although, for children with extended absenteeism, the process of achieving this may be a prolonged one. Behavioral strategies &quot;shaping&quot; return to school through successive approximations is an optimal strategy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change in expectations - While it is important that the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family maintain hope and optimism, realistic goals will help avoid disappointment and frustration. It is critical to help patients and families understand that this is a chronic condition and that there are no immediate, rapid, short-term interventions that will alleviate the problem. The goal is to improve functioning, normalize sleep, and address mood and coping first, with improvements in pain coming simultaneously or shortly thereafter. It is also important to set expectations that improvement is rarely linear, but, rather, it is characterized by steady gains as well as occasional setbacks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults with fibromyalgia, strong evidence shows that aerobic exercise has a beneficial effect, resulting in a sense of improved well-being, improved physical functioning, and a reduction in pain. Data show similar outcomes in juvenile fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H352172117\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one series, 64 children who had failed a home exercise program and local physical therapy were treated inpatient or in a day hospital for a mean of 23 days with five to six hours per day of individual physical and occupational therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">(PT/OT),</span> as well as a minimum of four hours a week of psychosocial therapy, but no pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Significant improvements in pain and function were demonstrated in both subjective and objective measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in improving the symptoms of children with fibromyalgia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-blind trial, 114 adolescents with fibromyalgia were randomized to CBT or fibromyalgia education after eight weeks of stable medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Both groups demonstrated a significant decrease in symptoms of depression and functional disability after eight weeks of therapy and at six-month follow-up, with the latter improving to a significantly greater degree in the CBT group. A significant decrease in pain was not seen in either group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another controlled trial, 30 adolescents with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to eight weeks of active pain-coping skills training or self-monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although all patients exhibited lower levels of disability and depressive symptoms after eight weeks than at baseline, those who received coping-skills training were better able to cope with pain than were those in the self-monitoring group. Subjects were then crossed over to the opposite treatment arm for eight weeks and were re-evaluated at week 16 of the study. All patients had lower levels of disability and depressive symptoms compared with baseline, but those who received self-monitoring followed by coping-skills training seemed to receive the most benefit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 67 children with fibromyalgia, cognitive-behavioral interventions (cognitive restructuring, thought stopping, distraction, relaxation, and self-reward) and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parent</span> education (pain management, psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, and activities of daily living) reduced pain, somatic symptoms, anxiety, fatigue, and school absences. The CBT group also showed improved sleep quality and reported improved functional ability in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of seven girls with fibromyalgia, cognitive-behavioral techniques (progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery) reduced pain and facilitated improved function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the use of medications in the treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia are limited. However, agents that have shown beneficial effects in adults also have been used in children and are sometimes effective. The following is a summary of agents that have been used in children with fibromyalgia. A more complete discussion on the use of each of these classes of medications in adults with fibromyalgia is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following antidepressants have been used to treat fibromyalgia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amitriptyline</a>). In general, these are effective even at doses below usual antidepressant levels, suggesting that changes in mood alone are not the mechanism by which they work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a>) and serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>).</p><p/><p>In a meta-analysis, these classes of antidepressants were shown to be effective in reducing pain and depression in adults with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a> have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome. In addition, tricyclic antidepressants were also beneficial in reducing pain and improving sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most analgesics, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids, are ineffective in reducing pain in patients with fibromyalgia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">GABA agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In randomized clinical trials, gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) agonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, help reduce pain in adults with fibromyalgia. Pregabalin was the first drug to be approved by the FDA for treatment of fibromyalgia. Both gabapentin and pregabalin are being used in children and adolescents with fibromyalgia and can be effective in reducing pain in some patients, even though neither drug has received a specific indication in this age group for this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative and complementary medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative or complementary medicine has not, in general, demonstrated sustained benefit in either adults or children with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Traditional Chinese acupuncture does not appear to be significantly more effective in relieving pain in adult patients with fibromyalgia than sham procedures. Data in children are limited to one small, observational study of children with chronic pain that reported improved discomfort after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but there are no data demonstrating its benefit specifically in patients with fibromyalgia. A randomized trial of 66 adult patients with fibromyalgia demonstrated greater improvement in the patients who performed tai chi twice a week for 12 weeks compared with those who performed a non-tai chi exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Whether such complementary approaches to fibromyalgia treatment are found to be beneficial in larger numbers of patients and in children and adolescents with fibromyalgia remains to be seen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies#H22300605\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies&quot;, section on 'Acupuncture'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies#H22300584\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies&quot;, section on 'Complementary and alternative therapies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little is known about the natural course of juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome, especially if left untreated. A number of studies have shown beneficial effects from pharmacologic, psychological, and physical interventions, but there are no follow-up data to determine the long-term impact of these treatments.</p><p>One study of 59 children (mean age at diagnosis 15.5 years) reported follow-up data at a mean duration of 18.3 months after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of the 50 patients available for follow-up, disease severity improved in 30 (60 percent), remained unchanged in 18 (36 percent), and worsened in 2 patients (4 percent) compared with their initial presentation. Thirty-seven patients were still taking medications at the end of the follow-up period. Active exercise was associated with a better outcome.</p><p>However, another study of 35 children with fibromyalgia reported a poorer outcome as 21 patients (60 percent) had not improved after a mean follow-up of 27 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Fibromyalgia, like other chronic conditions, may have a significant deleterious effect on quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a study of 59 children with fibromyalgia, patients self-reported severely impaired physical and psychosocial functioning using the Pediatric Quality of Life (Peds QL) Generic Core Score, PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and PedsQL Rheumatology Module Pain and Hurt Scale. Patients with fibromyalgia reported greater pain and fatigue than pediatric patients with other rheumatologic diseases and more fatigue when compared with children with cancer. These results demonstrated the significant effect that this disorder can have on an affected child at a single point in time.</p><p>Finally, there is the question of the trajectory of juvenile fibromyalgia over time. We know very little of the relationship between fibromyalgia in children and the syndrome in adults. Do children with fibromyalgia become adults with fibromyalgia? Do adults with fibromyalgia have a history of the syndrome when they were younger? Retrospective studies with adults tend to be flawed so that specific conclusions regarding antecedent childhood findings cannot be made. A single, prospective study found that approximately 60 percent of 48 young adults diagnosed with juvenile fibromyalgia in childhood or adolescence continued to experience widespread pain, poor sleep, and fatigue after a mean follow-up of 3.67 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another study of 94 patients with juvenile fibromyalgia and 33 gender-matched healthy controls followed for six years, the former group continued to have physical and emotional impairment into early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Further investigation of lifespan developmental approaches that focus on underlying mechanisms is needed to determine if there is a relationship between juvenile and adult fibromyalgia and, if so, whether intervention can alter the progression of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An interdisciplinary team that offers a combination of educational, cognitive-behavioral, physical, and pharmacologic interventions provides optimal management for the care of children with fibromyalgia.</p><p>We suggest the following management approach, which is patient centered and initially is focused on nonpharmacologic measures (see <a href=\"#H846193375\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmation of the diagnosis, education about the illness, and structure for living with this chronic disorder.
