The general approach is outlined in this section, and more specific recommendations are discussed below for the various toxicities. Our approach is consistent with those recommendations and those of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91786704\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose modifications and immunosuppressive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, treatment of moderate or severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) requires interruption of the checkpoint inhibitor and the use of corticosteroid immunosuppression. Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment for initial evidence of grade 1 adverse events. Treatment is based upon the severity of the observed toxicity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with grade 2 (moderate) immune-mediated toxicities, treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor should be withheld and should not be resumed until symptoms or toxicity is grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> or equivalent) should be started if symptoms do not resolve within a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) immune-mediated toxicities, treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor should be permanently discontinued. High doses of corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> or equivalent) should be given. When symptoms subside to grade 1 or less, steroids can be gradually tapered over at least one month.</p><p/><p>In the authors' experience, patients who will benefit from corticosteroids generally do so within days. If symptoms do not clearly improve, particularly after approximately three days with intravenous steroids, our approach is to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> rather than continue with a prolonged course of high-dose IV corticosteroids. If symptoms persist after the first infliximab dose, a second dose of infliximab (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> can be repeated two weeks after the initial dose.</p><p>The approach to the management of specific toxicities is discussed in the individual sections below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91786710\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of immunosuppression on efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for immunosuppressive therapy to manage irAEs does not appear to affect the response to checkpoint inhibition with either anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) antibodies or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-PD-1 antibodies &ndash; IrAEs are significantly less frequent with the anti-PD-1 antibodies compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In an analysis of 576 patients with advanced melanoma treated in four clinical trials, 24 percent received immunosuppressive therapy for the management of treatment-related adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There was no significant difference in the objective response rate between those who received immunosuppressive treatment and those who did not (29.8 versus 31.8 percent).

Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy was used in 29 cases (10 percent) who did not respond promptly to corticosteroids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The median overall survival was 16.5 months, and the estimated two-year survival rate was 39 percent for the entire cohort. Overall survival was the same in patients who had an irAE compared with those without an irAE, and there was no difference between those requiring corticosteroids and those not requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The time to treatment failure, defined as the need for alternative therapy or death, was 5.7 months for the entire cohort. As with overall survival, there were no significant differences between those with and without an irAE or between those treated with corticosteroids and those not receiving corticosteroids.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77637146\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77637167\"><span class=\"h2\">Opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged immune suppression is typically used to treat immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

Since both cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) have an important role in maintaining immunologic homeostasis, there is theoretical concern that therapeutic blockade of these receptors could lead to exacerbations of underlying autoimmune conditions or prior immune-related toxicity. </p><p>Given the life-threatening nature of the malignancies that patients face and the potential benefits of these checkpoint-blocking antibodies, clinicians should discuss the possible benefits and risks of immunologic checkpoint blockade with their patients. Retrospective data suggest that patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions or irAEs due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> can safely receive anti-PD1 therapy, experiencing a similar rate of irAEs that can usually be managed without need for permanent discontinuation of drug therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2439715389\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-PD-1 agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence indicates that anti-PD-1 agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a>) can be given safely and retain activity in patients with a pre-existing autoimmune disorder and in those who had major toxicity from prior <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> therapy.</p><p>A retrospective study analyzed the outcomes from 119 patients with advanced melanoma who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> at 13 academic centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 52 patients with a pre-existing autoimmune disorder, the objective response rate was 33 percent, and 20 patients (38 percent) had a flare of the autoimmune disorder requiring immunosuppression.

The most commonly represented autoimmune diseases included rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. </p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> in this setting appeared to be similar to that in the broader experience with this agent, with 6 of 30 (20 percent) patients having an objective response. Exacerbation of underlying autoimmune conditions occurred in 8 of 30 patients (27 percent), all of which were successfully managed with corticosteroids. There was one death due to colitis; in this case, immunosuppressive treatment was delayed for approximately one week due to delayed reporting of symptoms.

Since some patients with Hodgkin lymphoma may ultimately be referred for allogeneic HCT after PD-1 therapy, assessing toxicities of allogeneic transplantation in the setting of prior PD-1 is an important consideration in this patient population. One retrospective study reported outcomes in 39 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with a PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) who subsequently underwent allogeneic HCT (all but three with reduced intensity conditioning) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although the posttransplant relapse rate was favorable, there was a higher than expected rate of severe complications (four treatment-related deaths; one from hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, three from early acute graft-versus-host disease), and seven patients developed a noninfectious febrile syndrome that required treatment with steroids. Additional study in larger groups of patients is needed to determine whether prior PD-1 increases the toxicities of allogeneic HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77638037\"><span class=\"h2\">Biomarkers associated with side effects of checkpoint inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunologic biomarkers are being studied as a way to assess the risk of irAEs and as an aid in the early identification of such complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, ipilimumab-treated patients with melanoma who developed colitis had higher on-treatment serum concentrations of interleukin 17 (IL-17) compared with those without colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In that trial, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity with the combination was increased compared with either single agent (59 versus 21 and 28 percent, respectively, for nivolumab and ipilimumab).
