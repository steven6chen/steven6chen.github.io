Spondylosis, or degenerative arthritis affecting the spine, is the most common cause of LSS and typically affects individuals over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>LSS is a cause of disability in the aging population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Treatment approaches are often not straightforward and require careful consideration of potential risks and benefits.</p><p>This topic will discuss the prognosis and treatment of LSS, focusing on lumbar spondylosis. Other topics discuss more general issues related to the evaluation and treatment of low back pain, and also the pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonsurgical-interventional-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonsurgical interventional treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) due to degenerative spondylosis is relatively benign. Among 32 patients with symptoms and neuroimaging consistent with LSS who were followed for a mean 49 months without surgical intervention, symptoms remained unchanged in 70 percent, improved in 15 percent, and worsened in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, LSS causes discomfort, often limiting activities of daily living, and can lead to progressive disability.</p><p>Radiographic studies suggest that over time adjacent spinal segments also become affected in almost half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Some data indicate that this phenomenon may be a more frequent occurrence in those who undergo surgical fusion and contribute to re-operation rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSURGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, a trial of conservative, nonsurgical treatment precedes surgical treatment. The exception is the rare patient with progressive neurologic deficits, especially the cauda equina syndrome, which indicates more urgent surgical decompression.</p><p>Nonsurgical treatments used for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) have included physical therapy, analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, and epidural steroid injections. High quality clinical trials supporting the utility of these treatments are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other treatments for low back pain not specific to LSS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonsurgical-interventional-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonsurgical interventional treatment&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid and other injections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical therapy is the mainstay of conservative management, but evidence-based support in the literature is lacking. Regimens are not standardized. Stretching, strengthening, and aerobic fitness are usually recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-10</a>]. Goals of therapy include increased muscular stabilization and correction of posture. Techniques to increase lumbar flexion and reduce lumbar lordosis include strengthening of abdominal muscles. Abdominal corsets or braces can also help reduce lordosis and improve exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; however, their use is controversial, as overuse can lead to increased weakness of abdominal and other core muscles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One randomized study compared two six-week physical therapy regimens in 58 patients with LSS: manual physical therapy and treadmill walking versus lumbar flexion exercises, subtherapeutic ultrasound, and treadmill walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At six weeks, a greater proportion of patients in the first treatment group reported improvement (79 versus 41 percent); the difference was not statistically significant at one year (62 versus 41 percent). The physical therapy regimens were not well standardized, making specific recommendations difficult. However, this study provides some support for physical therapy programs in managing patients with LSS.</p><p>For overweight individuals, exercise for weight loss is an important goal to reduce lumbar lordosis and minimize axial strain on the spinal column. Bicycling and aquatic exercise programs may be good choices for patients with LSS. Dietary modification is also recommended as part of a weight loss program.

No studies have clearly identified the superiority of one class of drugs over another, but the complication profile of each plays a role in the ultimate choice for the individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of particular concern in the older age group is the associated cardiovascular risk associated with certain NSAIDs. The efficacy of these medications in managing isolated symptoms of neurogenic claudication is not clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;, section on 'Pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence does not support the use of epidural injections of corticosteroids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthetics in LSS. Most studies of this approach include a heterogeneous patient population with back pain, radicular pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurogenic claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>].</p><p>In a randomized trial of 400 patients with LSS and moderate to severe leg pain and disability, those patients who received one or two epidural injections of glucocorticoids plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> had similar pain and disability outcomes at six weeks as those who received injections of lidocaine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Adverse events (such as pain, headache, fever and infection) were nonsignificantly higher in the glucocorticoid group (21.5 versus 15.5 percent). Since this study did not include a sham control group, it does not rule out a potential benefit from the injection of the local anesthetic. Previously reported uncontrolled observational studies and small trials had suggested that injections of local anesthetic agents with or without corticosteroids were associated with reduced pain, in the short-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Potential indications for the use of epidural injections for the treatment of low back pain in other settings as well as a summary of associated adverse events are presented separately.

Surgical approaches are generally utilized after nonsurgical options have been exhausted and in patients who are disabled by their symptoms. In the absence of neurologic deficits, delayed surgery appears to produce benefits that are similar to surgery when selected as the initial treatment choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In cohort studies of individuals with LSS who initially chose nonsurgical therapy, about 30 percent subsequently requested surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Urgent surgery is required when neurologic deficits are rapidly progressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when bladder dysfunction emerges. While this may occur with cauda equina syndrome or conus medullaris syndrome in the setting of trauma or an intraspinal canal tumor, it is very rarely a manifestation of clinical decompensation in LSS due to spondylosis. In the former cases, the degree of neurologic recovery is related to the speed at which the compressive lesion is corrected and the severity of baseline deficits prior to intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical approaches for degenerative LSS include single or multilevel decompressive laminectomy with or without lumbar fusion. Lumbar fusion (with or without instrumentation) is generally reserved for patients with spondylolisthesis, a condition in which one vertebral body translates anteriorly or posteriorly with respect to an adjacent vertebral body. In the absence of spondylolisthesis (or other complicated spine pathology) the more conservative procedure (decompressive laminectomy without fusion) is preferred as it is associated with a lower complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A review of Medicare claims database demonstrated that as the frequency of complex fusion procedures for LSS increased, over the 2002 to 2007 time period, so did major complications, 30-day mortality, and resource use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Laminectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laminectomy, the most frequently used surgical procedure in this setting, involves removal of part or all of one or both lamina of the vertebra at the involved level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74811 \">figure 1</a>). In some cases the spinous process is removed as well; overlying connective tissues, ligaments, and muscle may be transected to gain access to the vertebra. </p><p>A systematic review of randomized surgical studies of degenerative lumbar spondylosis found some limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>In a subsequently-published multicenter study in the United States, 289 patients with symptomatic LSS but no spondylolisthesis were randomized to decompressive surgery versus nonsurgical care and followed for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Two-thirds of those randomized to surgical treatment and 43 percent of those assigned to nonsurgical care underwent surgery during the study period. In this study, the intention-to-treat analysis did find a benefit for surgery for a measure of bodily pain, but not for disability or functional outcome. An as-treated analysis, which also included an observational cohort of an additional 365 patients, demonstrated a benefit for surgery on all outcome measures at three months and two years, that was maintained at four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A smaller randomized trial of 94 patients also reported a benefit from surgical over conservative treatment that was smaller and diminished over time, with no significant benefit in disability at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A nonrandomized, prospective cohort study, the Maine Lumbar Spine Study followed 144 patients with LSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this study, the 77 patients choosing surgery had more severe symptoms and worse functional status at baseline. Surgically treated patients reported greater improvement in symptoms and functional status compared with the nonsurgical group at one and five years. The relative benefit of surgery declined over time, and was no longer statistically significant after five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Over the 10 years of the study, 15 of 77 surgically treated patients underwent repeat surgery, and 21 of the 67 initial nonsurgical patients underwent surgery. Regardless of the initial treatment group, patients receiving subsequent surgery reported less improvement than those who did not undergo subsequent procedures.</p><p>Other cohort studies in LSS have reported on the observed benefits associated with surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,30,31</a>]. All of these cohort studies have used heterogeneous and unvalidated patient outcome measures, making it difficult to assess and compare the magnitude of benefit. In general, 60 to 90 percent of patients report some improvement of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> quality of life in the first year after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As with the Maine Lumbar Spine Study, the benefit from surgery gradually declines over time. Outcomes vary significantly among studies and centers, suggesting that local surgical expertise and other procedural factors may influence outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraspinous spacer implantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potentially less invasive treatment option involves implanting a device between the spinous processes at one or two vertebral levels, relieving compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This procedure is said to be appropriate for those patients with spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis who have intermittent claudication symptoms that are exacerbated in extension and relieved in flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. A randomized, multicenter study in 191 patients compared the implantation of the X STOP implant, a titanium alloy device, to nonoperative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. At six months, symptoms were relieved in 52 percent of treated patients, compared with 9 percent of controls. Benefit was maintained at two and four years of follow-up and was associated with reduced disability and improved quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>Subsequent, uncontrolled observations have found that implantation of the X STOP device has been efficacious in many patients, if not in as large a proportion as was found in the clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40,41</a>]. While radiologic improvement in spinal canal and neuroforaminal narrowing can be measured after surgery, these changes are not correlated with clinical benefit and are not maintained over time in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Adverse effects also appear to be more commonly reported in general clinical experience; these include <span class=\"nowrap\">discitis/osteomyelitis,</span> device dislocations, spinous process fractures, recurrent disc herniation, hematoma, cerebrospinal fluid fistula, and foot drop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].</p><p>It is unclear how this newer procedure compares with the standard surgical procedure, decompressive laminectomy, in terms of effectiveness, side effects, recovery time and long-term outcomes.

Most surgeons include fusion when operating on patients with spondylolisthesis. The addition of instrumentation (insertion of rigid implants such as a rod or screw) in fusion improves the rate of successful fusion but does not clearly impact clinical outcomes, and is associated with a higher complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Similarly, intraoperative implantation of bone morphogenetic proteins has been shown to improve fusion rates, but has not been shown to clearly improve clinical outcomes and may increase complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/58-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-63</a>]. Administrative data of surgical outcomes from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1993 and 2002 reported a 13 percent complication rate that included hematoma, as well as pulmonary, renal, and cardiac complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

After a mean follow-up of three years, patients with spinal fusion had significantly less back and lower limb pain and had better physical function. In this study, unsuccessful radiographic fusion did not correlate with poor outcome. In contrast, a nonrandomized comparison of decompression with and without fusion in 5390 patients revealed no significant difference in patient satisfaction or recurrent operations at two years of followup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. &#160;</p><p>A study of 304 patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, and either neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy, randomly assigned patients to nonsurgical treatment or to decompressive laminectomy and fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Within two years of follow-up, 64 percent of those assigned to surgery and 49 percent of those assigned to conservative treatment underwent operative therapy.

Negative predictors were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant disorder influencing walking capacity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular comorbidity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scoliosis</p><p/><p>Positive predictors were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better walking ability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better self-rated health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less comorbidity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More pronounced canal stenosis</p><p/><p>Smoking has also been identified as being associated with negative surgical outcomes, including nonunion, delayed healing, and increased pseudarthrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/87-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-90</a>]. Animal studies have shown that nicotine administration reduces bone fusion rates, presumably by impairing revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. Smoking cessation appears to be beneficial in improving outcomes after surgery. In one review of 357 patients undergoing spinal fusion, the nonunion rate of those who stopped smoking for six months or longer after surgery was similar to nonsmokers and significantly less than those who continued to smoke (17 versus 14 versus 26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

However, for some patients, the symptoms become disabling and restrict activity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with LSS who do not have fixed or progressive neurologic deficits, we suggest conservative treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Physical therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral pain medication are often used, although their efficacy has not been rigorously evaluated. (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Nonsurgical treatment'</a> above).<br/><br/>The available evidence does not support the use of epidural injections of corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Epidural injections'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest surgical therapy for patients who do not have an adequate clinical response to conservative therapy and who are functionally disabled by their symptoms and for patients who have a progressive neurologic deficit (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In the absence of spondylolisthesis (or other complicated spine pathology) decompressive laminectomy without fusion is preferred over more complicated surgical techniques involving fusion with or without instrumentation (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend urgent surgical consultation for rare patients with a rapidly progressive cauda equina or conus medullaris syndrome or newly emerging bladder dysfunction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
