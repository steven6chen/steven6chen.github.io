In preparation for a trip, individuals should arrange a pretravel consultation with either a specialized travel clinic or a primary care practice with expertise in travel medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The traveler should come to the visits with a record of prior immunizations and an itinerary.</p><p>Immunization needs are based on the traveler's prior immunizations, health conditions, and likely exposures while traveling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82688 \">table 1</a>). Those exposures depend upon the countries and regions to be visited and on the nature of potential exposures to infectious agents. For example, travelers with short-term tourism itineraries may have different requirements from those with longer-term occupational exposures. A pretravel consultation enables updating of routine immunizations to protect against illness due to infections for which there is an increased risk of exposure during travel (such as diphtheria, measles, and varicella) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Information on the indications, dosing, side effects, timing, and contraindications for immunizations in travelers are provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a second-yearly publication, Health Information for International Travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], with ongoing updates in an online version.

Fatalities due to yellow fever acquired by unvaccinated tourists have occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. YF vaccination is legally required for entrance into specific countries, usually if the traveler is arriving from an infected country. However, many countries that have yellow fever transmission do not have a legal requirement for vaccination, and travelers to those countries need vaccination for their own protection.</p><p>The YF vaccine is a live virus vaccine grown in chick embryos. Following vaccine administration, a low-level viremia with the vaccine virus often develops within three to seven days and persists for one to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

A YF vaccination certificate for international travel is valid for the life of the recipient, no matter when it was issued.

Other contraindications include age &lt;6 months, allergy to a vaccine component, and thymic disorders. There is a precaution against yellow fever vaccination for travelers &ge;60 years of age and infants aged 6 to 8 months; for these patients, the risk of severe illness and death due to yellow fever infection should be balanced against the risk of serious vaccine effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Pregnancy is also a precaution for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a> administration (in contrast with most other live vaccines that are contraindicated in pregnancy). If travel is unavoidable and the risks for yellow fever virus exposure are felt to outweigh the vaccination risks, a pregnant woman should be vaccinated. If the risks for vaccination are felt to outweigh the risks for yellow fever virus exposure, pregnant women should be issued a medical waiver to fulfill any international health regulation requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In some circumstances, patients require proof of YF vaccination for travel, but YF vaccine administration is contraindicated.

For circumstances in which YF vaccine documentation must be presented to international customs officials according to International Health Regulations, the traveler can be provided with a Medical Letter of Waiver. For individuals planning travel to an area for which YF vaccine is recommended to avoid risk of infection in the unvaccinated traveler, serious consideration to a change in itinerary should be advised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3179735\"><span class=\"h4\">Major adverse events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three well-characterized serious adverse events occur following YF vaccine administration (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever#H4021643727\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Yellow fever&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions &ndash; These are uncommon (1.4 per 100,000 doses administered) and principally occur among persons with histories of allergies to egg or other substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The YF vaccine package insert contains a desensitization regimen that can be considered.

YEL-AND manifests as several distinct clinical syndromes, including meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and bulbar palsy. Meningoencephalitis occurs due to direct viral invasion of the central nervous system; the other syndromes are autoimmune manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incidence rate of YF vaccine-associated encephalitis in very young infants has been estimated to be 50 to 400 cases per 100,000 population, and the overall reporting rate for YEL-AND is 0.4 to 0.8 cases per 100,000 doses distributed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (rate in 60- to 69-year-olds: 1.6 cases per 100,000 doses distributed; rate if &ge;70 years: 1.1 to 2.3 cases per 100,000 doses distributed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This syndrome was first reported in 2001, and a total of about 57 cases have been described. The median time from vaccination to symptom onset is three days (range one to eight days); death has occurred in 65 percent of cases. All known cases of YEL-AVD have occurred following a recipient's first YF vaccination, with no reported cases following booster doses. The reporting rate of YEL-AVD is 0.3 to 0.4 cases per 100,000 doses distributed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but higher rates have been reported in older individuals (1.0 to 1.1 cases per 100,000 doses distributed in persons aged 60 to 69 years and 2.3 to 3.2 cases per 100,000 doses distributed for persons aged &ge;70 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-travel/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition to older age, history of thymus disease or thymectomy are specific risk factors. All primary vaccinees should clearly be told to call with any symptoms of any kind within one week of vaccination, and anyone with significant flu-like or febrile illnesses should be brought in for assessment as well as complete blood count and biochemistry.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1651524\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dosing consists of a single 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection.

There are two types of polio vaccine: an oral polio vaccine (OPV) containing live attenuated polioviruses and an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). In the United States and many regions of the world, only IPV is available given the rare risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) with OPV.</p><p>As of 2017, wild-type polio viruses persist in only two endemic countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan).
