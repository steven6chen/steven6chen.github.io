Multiple factors contribute to sleep impairment in this population: age- and dementia-related changes in sleep and circadian rhythms, primary sleep disorders, institutional and environmental factors, and comorbid illnesses and medications. Sleep disturbances and disorders are important to recognize and treat in patients with dementia, as they are a major contributor to caregiver distress and are associated with an increased likelihood of institutionalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of common sleep disturbances and sleep disorders in patients with dementia. The evaluation and treatment of other neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia are reviewed separately.

Population-based studies suggest that chronic sleep disturbances and decreases in total sleep time are often secondary to poor health and chronic disease rather than aging itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. This is further supported by observations that overall improvements in health correlate with improvements in sleep in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and that healthy older adults rarely exhibit pathologic sleep when assessed objectively with overnight polysomnography (PSG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dementia-related changes</strong> &ndash; Patients with neurodegenerative dementias report and exhibit more disruptive sleep compared with age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

In observational studies, subjective reductions in total sleep time, increased nighttime wakefulness, reduced sleep efficiency, poor subjective sleep quality, long sleep times (&gt;8 hours), and disturbed sleep have all been associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incident dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Some of these parameters also correlate with biomarkers of beta-amyloid pathology in cognitively healthy older adults, although findings have not been entirely consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Changes in sleep quality also vary based on the underlying dementia etiology. As an example, alpha-synucleinopathies (eg, Parkinson disease [PD], dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]) are characterized by nighttime sleep disturbances that tend to occur early in the course of disease (even preclinically) and remain stable throughout the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. By contrast, sleep disturbances in tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD) are more prominent in later stages of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1659168\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep architecture</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age-related changes</strong> &ndash; Sleep generally becomes lighter and more fragmented as individuals age. There are more arousals and awakenings during the night as well as an increased number of sleep stage shifts due to the arousals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The percentage of time spent in REM sleep decreases with age, with a corresponding increase in the time spent in lighter stages of sleep. Additionally, slow-wave sleep (also called deep sleep) exhibits a linear and gradual decrease of roughly 2 percent per decade of life starting in early to middle adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/3,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26</a>] and stabilizing by the seventh decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While these age-related changes in sleep architecture are well documented, their consequences are not well understood.

Patients with AD have more and longer awakenings, with subsequent increases in stage 1 sleep and decreases in slow-wave sleep. Patients with AD and PD exhibit a decreased percentage of REM sleep as well as reduced REM episodes, latency, and density when compared with healthy older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/24,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional electrophysiologic changes associated with specific types of dementia include a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of K complexes in patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>] and an increase in the prevalence of REM sleep without atonia in patients with alpha-synucleinopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The sleep-wake cycle is the most apparent circadian rhythm and is paralleled by the rhythms of core body temperature fluctuation and melatonin secretion. Circadian rhythms are regulated by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the endogenous clock of the brain. Zeitgebers are exogenous stimuli that entrain the circadian rhythm, which is slightly longer than 24 hours, to the 24-hour day. The most important zeitgeber is light; others include physical activity, meals, and social contact.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age-related changes</strong> &ndash; The most common circadian rhythm change of aging is phase advancement. This manifests as getting sleepy earlier in the evening and waking up earlier in the morning.

It is hypothesized that deterioration of the SCN leads to weakened functioning. These changes can result in more fragmented sleep, decreased sleep efficiency, and increased daytime sleepiness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, the external cues that are necessary to entrain the circadian sleep-wake rhythm may be weak or missing in older adults. Older adults tend to spend very little time exposed to bright light; this is even more prominent among adults living in nursing homes. Like other sleep changes, changes in circadian rhythm (eg, decreased rhythm amplitude and robustness, delayed rhythms) may themselves be risk factors for cognitive decline and incident dementia in aging adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dementia-related changes</strong> &ndash; Circadian rhythm disturbances are more prominent and more disabling in patients with dementia compared with healthy older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

As a result, it is very common for patients with AD to have more activity during the night than during the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, the phenomenon of sundowning, where behavioral disturbances peak in the late afternoon or evening, is closely related to circadian rhythm abnormalities.

Dysregulation of melatonin secretion, a natural hormone produced by the pineal gland and controlled by the SCN, has also been noted in patients with dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p>As in older adults, patients with dementia may have decreased exposure to environmental zeitgebers or weakening of their impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/49,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,55</a>].

Difficulty falling asleep may be the result of an insomnia disorder, restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(RLS/WED),</span> disturbed circadian rhythms, medications (eg, stimulants), or other substances (eg, caffeine, nicotine). Difficulties staying asleep may be result of insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), circadian disturbances, or environmental factors (eg, noise).

ISWRD is characterized by the lack of a clearly defined sleep-wake rhythm, with at least three short bouts of waking that can last one to four hours throughout a 24-hour period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103995 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F108177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108177 \">table 1</a>).

Additionally, decrease or lack of environmental zeitgebers such as light and social schedule may precipitate or further exacerbate the disorder.

Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep diary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> actigraphy for the evaluation of sleep-wake patterns and the diagnosis of circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders. Actigraphy is a noninvasive method for recording rest-activity cycles based on measurement of motor activity with a device worn around the wrist. Actigraphy can be particularly useful in the evaluation of patients with dementia because it provides longitudinal and objective data on sleep patterns, activity, and light exposure (in some devices), independent of patient or caregiver recall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103995 \">figure 1</a>). Actigraphy has also been extensively used and validated in patients with PD, where motor symptoms can obscure the clinical assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

While in-laboratory PSG assessment may be necessary in certain cases (eg, suspected RBD), such testing can be extremely challenging to complete in patients with advanced dementia. For suspected RBD, the role of PSG is twofold: to document characteristic REM sleep without atonia (RSWA), and to rule out OSA, which can cause dream enactment by virtue of sleep fragmentation. If possible, ambulatory recording devices that require minimal equipment and wires may be more pragmatic when there is a high suspicion for OSA or PLMD. Different devices are required for each of these two conditions, however, and these devices generally do not record sleep.

However, the risks and burdens of various interventions must be weighed against expected benefits. In general, nonpharmacologic strategies should be fully explored and employed before considering pharmacotherapy, with rare exceptions (eg, dopamine agonist for restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease <span class=\"nowrap\">[RLS/WED]</span> or periodic limb movement disorder [PLMD], melatonin or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> for rapid eye movement [REM] sleep behavior disorder [RBD] with potentially injurious behaviors).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515601682\"><span class=\"h2\">Insomnia and other sleep-wake disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of difficulties in sleep initiation and maintenance (ie, insomnia) or irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD) in patients with dementia must be individualized according to patient needs, capabilities, and patient and caregiver preferences. We approach insomnia and circadian sleep-wake rhythm disturbances similarly. Behavioral, nonpharmacological treatments that focus on environmental changes and establishing consistent patterns are the mainstay of therapy, especially for patients who have mild to moderate dementia and are able to follow behavioral planning with the help of a caregiver.</p><p>In order to best gauge whether an intervention is working, we recommend regular outcome assessments and routine use of sleep diaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 4</a>) to be completed by caregivers. Questionnaires such as the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>] and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] may be useful for serial monitoring of treatment response in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264902394\"><span class=\"h3\">Environmental restructuring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor sleep is closely related to environmental disturbances, particularly in the hospital and nursing home settings. Addressing these factors is important across a range of sleep disturbances and etiologies in patients with dementia.</p><p>General recommendations for environmental restructuring include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the environment dark during the night and bright during the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce noise at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eliminate unnecessary nocturnal awakenings for vital signs and medication administration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, match roommates living in institutions based on their sleep-wake patterns</p><p/><p>In institutional settings, noise and roommate disturbances can directly impact nocturnal sleep quality. Multiple nighttime disturbances by clinicians and staff are common due to requirements for vital signs checks, movement to avoid pressure sores, and medication administration. In one study, nursing home staff was responsible for 50 percent of patients' nighttime awakenings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Many of these interruptions can be avoided or minimized by scheduling them before and after regular sleep times.</p><p>Other environmental factors have an indirect impact on sleep through changes in circadian rhythms, including changes in light exposure, exercise, and socialization. Institutionalized adults have significantly lower exposure to diurnal light and higher exposure to nocturnal light compared with community-dwelling older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/55,56,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56,94</a>]. Strengthening these environmental cues can help to entrain more normal circadian rhythms and thereby improve sleep quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515601490\"><span class=\"h3\">Addressing polypharmacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polypharmacy is common among patients with dementia and is often implicated in complaints of insomnia or other sleep-wake disturbances. In our experience, sleep-related side effects of medications are commonly overlooked.</p><p>Medications for chronic medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychiatric conditions (eg, antipsychotic medications, stimulants, respiratory medications, antihypertensives, and decongestants) may significantly impact sleep and result in sleep disturbances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50646 \">table 5</a>). When possible, culprit medications should be discontinued.</p><p>For essential medications, the timing of medication administration should be considered, such that stimulating medications and diuretics are taken earlier in the day and sedating medications are administered prior to bedtime.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264900427\"><span class=\"h3\">Multicomponent behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral therapy is best accomplished with a multicomponent treatment program that involves both patient and caregiver, ideally over multiple sessions. Support for this approach is drawn from a large body of literature on cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/95-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-97</a>] and more limited studies on the application and modification of these techniques for patients with dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/98-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-101</a>]. The behavioral components of CBTI are most relevant in patients with dementia, as opposed to the cognitive components (eg, restructuring maladaptive thoughts about sleep).</p><p>Key aspects of a multicomponent approach include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental restructuring (see <a href=\"#H264902394\" class=\"local\">'Environmental restructuring'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of polypharmacy (see <a href=\"#H515601490\" class=\"local\">'Addressing polypharmacy'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep hygiene education (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilization and maintenance of consistent sleep-wake schedules</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulus control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77189 \">table 7</a>)</p><p/><p>Over multiple sessions, these components are modified based on patient response, the environment, and other issues that arise during treatment. Depending upon symptoms and response, treatment programs may include several components that focus on the environment and also target circadian rhythm disturbances, such as light exposure and exercise.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our experience, stabilization and maintenance of a consistent sleep-wake schedule are best achieved by setting a consistent wake-up time. If possible, patients should also maintain a consistent bedtime; however, patients may find this difficult for a variety of reasons (eg, napping during the day, exerting more energy on some days). Even if a patient goes to sleep at different times, waking up at a consistent time will help stabilize the rhythms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bright light therapy can be achieved in several ways. Weather permitting, spending time outdoors in the morning, paired with a physical activity such as walking, is an optimal strategy that can be incorporated into the daily home or institutional routine. Sunglasses should be avoided to maximize light reaching the eyes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are more restricted, light boxes that emit appropriate light strength are readily available for purchase. Light intensity is measured in lux (a measure of amount of light one receives at a specific distance from the source of the light). We suggest at least 30 minutes in front of the light box first thing in the morning using a 10,000 lux light box or full spectrum light. Using a light box of lower intensity will require more exposure time to achieve similar effect.</p><p/><p>When tested individually, bright light therapy, exercise, and environmental restructuring have been shown to result in only modest improvements in sleep and circadian rhythms in older adults and patients with dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/92,93,102-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93,102-107</a>].

Over the course of six sessions, patients and their caregivers learned to evaluate and identify sleep schedules, activities, and environmental factors that might impact sleep as well as strategies to manipulate these factors in ways congruent with improved sleep. Post-therapy, patients exhibited significant reductions in nighttime awakenings, time spent awake during the night, and improved depression ratings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness of a similar multicomponent treatment in nursing home residents who had major comorbidities and cognitive impairment and demonstrated a decrease in daytime sleepiness, increase in social participation and exercise, and decrease in nighttime awakenings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264900759\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacotherapy does not have a role in the routine management of insomnia or other sleep-wake disturbances in patients with dementia. There are no controlled trials to support the effectiveness of these medications in this patient population, and older adults with cognitive impairment have increased susceptibility to a variety of side effects (eg, drowsiness, confusion, gait instability, nocturnal falls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/87,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,108</a>].</p><p>When drugs are prescribed for insomnia in patients with dementia, it is often at the request of a stressed or overwhelmed caregiver when nonpharmacologic strategies have not been fully explored, and the sleeping problems rarely resolve over time. We strongly encourage a multicomponent, nonpharmacologic approach that should, over time, obviate the need for pharmacologic sedation.</p><p>Use of prolonged release melatonin (2 mg) was reported to improve sleep maintenance and cognitive function compared with placebo in a randomized trial of 80 older patients with mild to moderate AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-and-sleep-disorders-in-patients-with-dementia/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].

Studies in patients with dementia are more limited. In addition, there are several unique barriers to CPAP use in patients with dementia. Patients with significant memory deficits may require reminders from their caregiver; others may require assistance in placing the CPAP due to impaired motor dexterity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-apnea-and-other-causes-of-impaired-sleep-in-older-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep apnea and other causes of impaired sleep in older adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Nonetheless, these potential difficulties should not deter clinicians from appropriate diagnosis and treatment of OSA, particularly when OSA is associated with clinical symptoms such as daytime sleepiness that are bothersome to the patient and family. Clinicians should be prepared to help troubleshoot anticipated and unanticipated problems with CPAP application and adherence. When CPAP therapy is initiated in patients with dementia, the caregiver should be trained in how to use the mask and CPAP machine along with the patient.

Changes can be observed in total sleep time, time spent awake after sleep onset, sleep architecture, and circadian rhythms. (See <a href=\"#H1659148\" class=\"local\">'Sleep quality and duration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1659168\" class=\"local\">'Sleep architecture'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1659188\" class=\"local\">'Circadian rhythms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulties with sleep initiation and sleep continuity are probably the most common sleep-wake disturbances in patients with dementia, affecting approximately one-third of patients. Other common problems include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), increased agitation in the evenings (sundown syndrome), and abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep. (See <a href=\"#H264899831\" class=\"local\">'Symptom spectrum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best way to detect and diagnose sleep-wake disturbances in patients with dementia is to routinely ask about them. Caregiver or bed partner interview is crucial to supplement the history provided by the patient. The history should focus on three major areas of sleep complaints: difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, EDS, and unusual sleep-related behaviors or movements. (See <a href=\"#H264899860\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the initial assessment indicates difficulty with sleep initiation and maintenance, the next step is to consider the timing of sleep over the 24-hour cycle. Unusual sleep timing (eg, sleeping during the day more than night, going to sleep very early or very late) suggests a circadian rhythm disorder. If sleep timing is unchanged from the premorbid state, the most likely causes are primary insomnia, restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(RLS/WED),</span> or effects of medications or the environment. (See <a href=\"#H72635613\" class=\"local\">'Formulating a diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many sleep-wake disorders in patients with dementia are diagnosed by history alone. Others, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), require further evaluation with polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep apnea testing. (See <a href=\"#H1659343\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor sleep in adults with dementia is closely related to environmental disturbances, particularly in hospital and nursing home settings. General strategies for environmental restructuring include keeping the environment dark during the night and bright during the day, reducing noise at night, eliminating unnecessary nocturnal awakenings, and matching roommates based on sleep-wake patterns when possible. (See <a href=\"#H264902394\" class=\"local\">'Environmental restructuring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For insomnia and circadian rhythm disturbances in patients with dementia, we suggest behavioral, nonpharmacologic therapies that are individualized according to patient needs, capabilities, and patient and caregiver preferences (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with mild to moderate dementia who are able to follow behavioral planning with the help of a caregiver are good candidates for multicomponent behavioral therapy that focuses on environmental changes and establishing consistent sleep patterns. (See <a href=\"#H264900427\" class=\"local\">'Multicomponent behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with advanced dementia, nonpharmacologic interventions consist primarily of environmental restructuring and management of polypharmacy. (See <a href=\"#H264902394\" class=\"local\">'Environmental restructuring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H515601490\" class=\"local\">'Addressing polypharmacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pharmacotherapy for insomnia is poorly studied in patients with dementia and is associated with a high risk of side effects. (See <a href=\"#H264900759\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild to moderate dementia and comorbid OSA can tolerate and adhere to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP has been shown to improve sleep and have some positive impact on cognition in patients with dementia. (See <a href=\"#H1659355\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span> occur with increased frequency in patients with dementia and are readily treatable with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies.
