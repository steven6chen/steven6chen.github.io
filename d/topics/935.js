This topic will discuss the anesthetic management of labor and delivery for preeclamptic patients, including labor analgesia, cesarean delivery, fluid management, and invasive monitoring. The pathogenesis, clinical features and diagnosis, and obstetric management of patients with preeclampsia are discussed separately.

Women with preeclampsia are at an increased risk for life-threatening events, including placental abruption, cerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, hepatic failure or rupture, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and progression to eclampsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The preanesthesia evaluation of these patients should focus on severity of disease, the airway examination, hemodynamic status, and coagulation parameters, all of which may change over time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3896218020\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity of preeclampsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preeclampsia may be classified as severe (also called preeclampsia with severe features) or preeclampsia without severe features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In general, peripartum anesthesia for patients with preeclampsia without severe features is managed as it would be for patients without preeclampsia, recognizing that severity may increase at any time. Patients with preeclampsia without severe features may or may not receive magnesium for seizure prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Seizure prophylaxis'</a> and <a href=\"#H3140834780\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative magnesium'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4014850864\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway management may be particularly difficult in preeclamptic patients who are prone to edema and bleeding with airway instrumentation. Airway edema may worsen over the course of labor, and may be present even with a reassuring airway examination. Airway evaluation is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2756618946\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary edema'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2362692095\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe preeclampsia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count) may develop thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of spinal epidural hematoma with neuraxial anesthesia techniques. Both the absolute platelet count, and the trend in the count over time are important considerations for the timing and advisability of neuraxial procedures. The platelet count necessary to safely perform neuraxial anesthesia is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and practice varies. In the absence of other coagulation abnormalities, we usually perform neuraxial anesthesia procedures for patients with a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;75,000/microL,</span> with close followup for signs of spinal epidural hematoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H3627956713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Neuraxial analgesia and low platelets'</a>.)</p><p>Other coagulopathies may develop, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, as well as liver function abnormalities, and may also preclude the use of neuraxial techniques. Coagulation testing, other than a platelet count, should be individualized based on patient factors (eg, liver function test abnormalities, abruption). Changes in prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and fibrinogen do not occur in most preeclamptic patients with a normal platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>We do not transfuse patients with platelets solely to allow neuraxial anesthesia. However, if the obstetrician administers platelet transfusion prior to cesarean delivery, there may be an opportunity for spinal anesthesia. Indications for platelet transfusion and correction of coagulopathy are discussed separately.

The decision to care for these patients on the labor floor, or in the intensive care unit (ICU), should be institution specific, collaborative between anesthesia, obstetric, and nursing teams, and based on available resources and clinical expertise. </p><p>Advantages of care on the labor floor include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximity of the obstetric, neonatal, and obstetric anesthesia teams, for rapid response to changing clinical situations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familiarity of the nursing staff with intrapartum assessment of labor, fetal monitoring, and the drugs, procedures, and interventions frequently used during labor and delivery</p><p/><p>Advantages of the intensive care unit for these patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familiarity with invasive monitoring and vasoactive infusions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior resources for maternal resuscitation</p><p/><p>In some institutions, the best compromise may be to cross cover, with obstetric and ICU nurses sharing patient care in the most appropriate unit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H818074266\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODYNAMIC MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure may be labile, and change rapidly in patients with preeclampsia, due to disease progression, administration of vasoactive medications, the pain of labor, or anesthetic interventions. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring (ie, arterial catheterization, central venous catheter placement) is not routine for these patients, but may be indicated in some circumstances.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arterial catheterization </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A radial artery catheter should be considered prior to induction of general anesthesia for patients with severe preeclampsia, if time permits, to provide continuous blood pressure monitoring and rapid response to adverse changes. (See <a href=\"#H1805503008\" class=\"local\">'General anesthesia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2324694342\" class=\"local\">'Goal blood pressure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radial artery catheters are not routinely placed for hemodynamic monitoring during labor for patients with preeclampsia. However, radial artery catheterization is a low-risk procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] that may be beneficial for continuous blood pressure monitoring, and facilitates blood sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Indications for placement are similar to those for patients without preeclampsia, including difficult peripheral venous access, central administration of vasoactive infusions, and measurement of cardiac function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> preload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-during-anesthesia#H2717003433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring during anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Other monitors of circulation'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, complication rates for central line placement are relatively high in patients with severe preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and there are no randomized trials to support the use of CVCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Blood pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;160/110</span> mmHg should be lowered aggressively, while monitoring the fetus to be sure that uteroplacental perfusion is maintained and late decelerations do not develop. The medications and doses used for treatment of acute, severe hypertension are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110261\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110261 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Though specific blood pressure targets are not supported by data, goals for blood pressure management for preeclamptic patients should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of severe hypertension to reduce the risk of stroke and intracranial hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; Severe systolic hypertension is associated with stroke in these patients in the peripartum period.

Treatment priorities in this setting are the same as the priorities for patients without anesthesia, as follows (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eclampsia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eclampsia&quot;, section on 'Prevention of recurrent seizures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eclampsia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eclampsia&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway protection and prevention of hypoxia</strong> &mdash; Supplemental oxygen should be provided and the airway supported until the seizure ends. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Control of hypertension </strong>&mdash; Blood pressure control should be meticulously maintained at &lt;160 mmHg systolic</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention of recurrent seizures</strong> &mdash; Magnesium is the drug of choice for prevention of seizures.

The evaluation should focus on the airway, hemodynamic status, and coagulation abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H4252746037\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthesia evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with preeclampsia are at risk for airway edema and difficulty with airway management. Airway edema may worsen during labor and delivery. (See <a href=\"#H4014850864\" class=\"local\">'Airway evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia and other coagulopathies may develop with severe preeclampsia, and may preclude neuraxial anesthesia techniques because of the risk of spinal epidural hematoma. We place epidural catheters early in labor, especially for patients with falling platelet counts. In the absence of other coagulopathies, we place epidural catheters for patients with a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;75,000/microL,</span> do not perform neuraxial techniques if the platelet count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;50/microL,</span> and make individualized decisions for patients with a platelet count between 50 and 75 microL. (See <a href=\"#H2362692095\" class=\"local\">'Coagulation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous fluid administration should be restricted for patients with preeclampsia to avoid pulmonary edema. No fluid bolus is required for initiation of labor analgesia, and fluid co-loading with neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery should be avoided or limited to &lt;500 mL. (See <a href=\"#H750856792\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of neuraxial analgesia for labor for patients with preeclampsia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Continuous neuraxial analgesia attenuates the hypertensive response to labor pain and circulating catecholamines, and provides a means for rapid conversion to surgical neuraxial anesthesia and avoidance of general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H3587243778\" class=\"local\">'Advantages of neuraxial labor analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with preeclampsia, we target a blood pressure at the patient&rsquo;s baseline, but always systolic &lt;160 mmHg and diastolic &lt;110 mmHg. Vasopressors should be administered in small doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> 2.5 to 5 mg IV, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> 25 to 50 mcg IV). (See <a href=\"#H2324694342\" class=\"local\">'Goal blood pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend neuraxial anesthesia rather than general anesthesia for patients with preeclampsia, for cesarean delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), primarily because it avoids the risk of severe, possibly life threatening hypertension during induction of anesthesia or during emergence. Endotracheal intubation may be difficult in these edematous patients. Spinal, epidural, and combined spinal epidural may all be used safely. (See <a href=\"#H785231152\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For prevention of neuraxial anesthesia-induced hypotension for patients with preeclampsia, we administer a prophylactic, titrated administration of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> infusion (ie, starting at <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50&nbsp;mcg/min)&nbsp;with</span> phenylephrine rescue boluses (eg, 25 to 50 mcg IV). For patients with bradycardia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> (5 to 10 mg IV bolus, or 1 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span> IV infusion) should be administered as an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H404880199\" class=\"local\">'Vasopressors during neuraxial analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When time permits, we consider placement of an arterial catheter prior to induction of general anesthesia for patients with severe preeclampsia. Induction of general anesthesia for these patients should always include steps to minimize or eliminate the hypertensive response to intubation. A variety of medications may be administered during induction for this purpose, with a target systolic blood pressure &lt;160 mmHg (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, nitroglycerine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>). (See <a href=\"#H204530840\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnesium is routinely administered to prevent seizures in preeclamptic patients. We recommend continuing magnesium in the operating room during cesarean delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Magnesium <strong>potentiates</strong> nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs); nondepolarizing NMBAs should be avoided. If NMBAs are absolutely necessary, they should be administered in small, incremental doses, and the effect should be monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator. (See <a href=\"#H3140834780\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative magnesium'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-preeclampsia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Estcourt LJ, Ingram C, Doree C, et al.
