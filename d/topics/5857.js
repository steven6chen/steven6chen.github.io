At that time, case reports described patients who developed intense suicidal ideation during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The manufacturer of fluoxetine subsequently performed a meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials (3065 patients with major depression) and found that the pooled incidence of the combined outcome of preparatory acts, nonfatal self-harm, or death did not differ significantly between patients who received fluoxetine or placebo (0.3 versus 0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The analyses suggested an increased risk of suicidal ideation, preparatory acts for self-harm, or nonfatal self-harm occurring during the first weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, compared with placebo. As a result, the FDA elevated the advisory and issued a warning regarding emergence of suicidality in children and adolescents starting antidepressant treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-adults/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p>The FDA issued an advisory in 2005 about suicidality in adults treated with antidepressant drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 2007, the FDA extended the 2004 warning about antidepressant drugs and suicidality to include adults aged 18 to 24 years and all antidepressant drugs. The warning issued in 2007 did not advise against the prescription of antidepressants for approved indications, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Instead, the warning emphasized that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients 18 to 24 years of age should be informed about the risk of developing suicidality during initial antidepressant treatment (generally the first one to two months).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should monitor patients closely during initial antidepressant treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression and certain other serious psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with an increased risk of suicidality.</p><p/><p>Although the risk of suicidality posed by antidepressants remains in question, there is no doubt about the risk of suicidality in untreated depressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, an observational study of 186 depressed patients followed for up to 38 years found that 14 percent committed suicide, which was 27 times greater than the rate in the general population; treatment with an antidepressant was associated with a lower rate of suicide mortality.

The highest quality of existing evidence consists of meta-analyses of data from secondary analyses of randomized efficacy trials.</p><p>The question about whether antidepressants precipitate suicidality should ideally be answered with placebo-controlled trials specifically designed to address this issue. However, no such trials exist and it would not be feasible to assign depressed patients to a long-term placebo arm. Instead, we must rely upon secondary analyses of trials designed to evaluate clinical efficacy and medical adverse events. Our ability to answer the question with these analyses is restricted by certain factors. First, patients at high risk for suicide attempts are typically excluded from such trials (limiting external validity or generalizability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-antidepressants-on-suicide-risk-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, data from such trials are limited in their capacity to detect change in suicidality and, in addition, cannot address the patients about whom we are most concerned. A second limitation of existing trials is that assessments were not designed to identify emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation. Consequently, reanalyses of those data depend on post-hoc classification of measurements intended for a different purpose. Third, although most trials involved patients with depression, some trials involved other psychiatric illnesses, such as anxiety disorders. Fourth, trials were short-term in duration, lasting approximately six to eight weeks.</p><p>Suicide deaths are relatively rare events in randomized trials, and there were typically fewer than 100 completed suicides for all drugs and placebo combined in the meta-analyses. Although the analyses included hundreds of trials and tens of thousands of patients, statistical power to detect differences in suicide mortality rates was modest. Thus, none of the analyses could rule out relatively large (ie, three- or fourfold) increases or decreases in risk of suicide mortality during antidepressant treatment compared with placebo.

The warning does not advise against the use of antidepressants for approved indications, including depressive and anxiety disorders. (See <a href=\"#H16005408\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear evidence that antidepressant treatment of depressed patients increases the risk of suicidality (suicidal ideation, action to prepare for an attempt, attempt or nonfatal self-harm, or death) in adults. Randomized trials suggest that antidepressants may possibly reduce suicidality; some observational and ecological studies show an association between greater antidepressant use and decreased suicide attempts and suicide deaths. (See <a href=\"#H16005416\" class=\"local\">'Evidence review'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available evidence strongly suggests an age-specific effect of antidepressants and risk of suicidality. Among young adults (and children and adolescents), onset of suicidality is significantly greater compared with placebo, during at least the first few weeks of antidepressant treatment. The absolute difference is approximately four patients per 1000. However, the same evidence shows no detectable effect of antidepressant treatment on suicidality in middle-aged adults, and suggests a protective effect (lower risk of suicidality with antidepressant medication than with placebo) among older adults. (See <a href=\"#H2249150277\" class=\"local\">'Suicidality and age'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The small risk of suicidality in young adults associated with antidepressants needs to be balanced against the clear risk of suicidality associated with depressive syndromes.

In addition, all patients initiating antidepressant therapy should receive follow-up within two to four weeks.
