The concept of the TACs is useful for clinicians seeking a pathophysiologic understanding of the primary neurovascular headaches and a rational therapeutic approach to treating or preventing these headaches. Despite the diagnostic challenges, the short-lasting primary headaches are important to recognize because of their excellent but highly selective response to therapy.</p><p>Currently, the treatment of cluster headache is based on empirical data rather than a clear understanding of the biologic mechanisms that underlie the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Drug treatment in cluster headache shows a placebo rate of about 30 percent, similar to that observed in migraine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In general, cluster headache treatment can be divided into acute therapy aimed at aborting individual attacks and prophylactic therapy aimed at preventing recurrent attacks during the cluster period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the acute treatment, prevention, and prognosis of cluster headache. Other aspects of cluster headache are discussed separately.

Therefore, preventive therapy should be started without delay once a cluster headache bout begins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2157482804\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute headache treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with acute cluster headache, we recommend initial treatment with either 100 percent oxygen or a triptan, in agreement with national guidelines and expert consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Oxygen should be tried first if available (eg, in a hospital or emergency clinic setting) since it is without side effects. Otherwise, subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> 6 mg can be used as initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Triptans'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who have suboptimal response to inhaled oxygen and are unable to administer or tolerate subcutaneous injections, we suggest treatment with intranasal triptans. Choices include intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> 20 mg or intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolmitriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolmitriptan</a> (5 mg). Intranasal triptans are administered <strong>contralateral</strong> to the side of headache. Intranasal triptan treatment has a slower onset of action than subcutaneous injection, but is more convenient to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>For patients who do not respond to or tolerate triptans and oxygen, alternative choices include intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Lidocaine'</a> below), oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergotamine</a>, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a> (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ergots'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect evidence suggests that intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> for acute cluster headache is less effective than triptan treatment.

The goal is to suppress attacks over the expected duration of the cluster period. An effective preventive regimen is of utmost importance because patients typically have one to eight cluster headaches a day, and repeated use of abortive medications may result in toxicity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rebound.</p><p>For patients with chronic cluster headache and those with relatively long-lasting (ie, two months or longer) active periods of episodic cluster headache, we recommend initial preventive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Verapamil'</a> below), in agreement with national and expert consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Many preventive drugs require several weeks of therapy and dose escalation until efficacy is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Due to the relatively long time needed to titrate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> to an effective dose, glucocorticoids (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a> where available) may be used as adjunctive therapy in the first two weeks of verapamil administration. Glucocorticoids in particular can rapidly suppress cluster attacks during the time required for the longer-acting preventive agents to take effect. An alternative is greater occipital nerve block ipsilateral to the headache attacks. (See <a href=\"#H3306952680\" class=\"local\">'Greater occipital nerve blocks'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with episodic cluster headache who have active cluster periods that last less than two months, we suggest initial preventive therapy with glucocorticoids alone (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below). Because of their potential for systemic side effects, glucocorticoids should only be used for short-term prophylaxis.</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergotamine</a> has a relatively long half-life compared with triptans, and can be used as preventive treatment (evening dosage) for attacks that occur only at night. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ergots'</a> below.)</p><p>Although there is no high quality evidence supporting the utility of combining various prophylactic drug treatments in cluster headache, clinical experience suggests that some patients do better with a combination of preventive medications rather than high dose monotherapy. In most instances of combined therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> is given in moderate doses (240 to 480 mg daily) in conjunction with another prophylactic medication, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>.</p><p>For patients with episodic cluster headache, prophylactic medications should be tapered after the expected duration of the cluster has passed. For patients with chronic cluster headache who have a good response to preventive pharmacotherapy, we suggest a dose reduction trial of preventive medications every three months. The drugs can be restarted at the lowest effective dose if symptoms recur.</p><p>When chronic cluster headache is unresponsive to medical treatments, various surgical interventions and neurostimulation techniques are potential treatment options, though none are clearly established as effective. In such cases, it is particularly important to exclude potential causes of secondary cluster headache. Neurostimulation techniques, including sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation, appear promising but remain investigational. Destructive surgical procedures are unproven and should be viewed with great caution. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Surgery and neurostimulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> and oxygen inhalation are first-line treatments for acute cluster headache attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other agents with some evidence of effectiveness include ergots, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although controlled trial evidence is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], oxygen therapy is considered to be safe and effective for aborting cluster headache.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A double-blind randomized trial evaluated 76 patients, each treating four cluster headache attacks, and compared 100 percent oxygen therapy (at 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> for 15 minutes) with air placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. By intention-to-treat analysis, pain-free status or adequate relief of attacks at 15 minutes was significantly more frequent with oxygen (78 percent of attacks, versus 20 percent with placebo).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two early small randomized trials found that inhalation of pure oxygen was beneficial for acute cluster headache attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Significant pain reduction was observed within 20 to 30 minutes in approximately 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>In some patients, oxygen may be completely effective even when the pain is at maximal intensity, but in other cases the response is incomplete. Repeated or frequent oxygen intake in a short period of time should be avoided, because there is evidence that the attack frequency may increase in some patients with overuse of oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Oxygen (100 percent) is administered via a nonrebreathing facial mask with a flow rate of at least 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> with the patient in a sitting, upright position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The inhalation should continue for 15 minutes to prevent the attack from returning, although the pain may subside as soon as five minutes after starting oxygen. Higher oxygen flow rates, up to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min,</span> may sometimes be effective when standard rates are not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. From a practical standpoint, it is reasonable to increase the flow rate if a lower rate is ineffective, as higher flow rate does not increase the risk of side effects. The use of a demand valve mask may enhance the efficacy of oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Oxygen is generally safe and without side effects. However, patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should not be treated with inhaled oxygen because of the risk for developing severe hypercapnia and CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis.</p><p>Unlike normobaric oxygen therapy, hyperbaric oxygen is not widely available, and there are few studies evaluating its utility for abortive treatment of cluster headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Triptans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have established that triptans, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolmitriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolmitriptan</a>, are effective for the acute treatment of cluster headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In trials involving a combined total of 183 patients with cluster headache, subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> (6 mg) was beneficial (ie, pain-free within 20 minutes) in about 75 percent of patients, whereas the response rate for placebo was 25 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

While triptans are generally well tolerated, uncomfortable side effects include nonischemic chest pain and distal paresthesia. It is still recommended that triptans be avoided in patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease or stroke, Prinzmetal angina, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, or pregnancy. It may be prudent to give the first triptan dose under medical supervision for patients with risk factors but no known coronary heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Triptans'</a>.)</p><p>Because of concerns about potential adverse effects, including medication overuse headache, some experts suggest that subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> 6 mg should be limited to no more than two doses in 24 hours, and intranasal triptans to no more than three doses in 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Verapamil'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with episodic cluster headache who have active cluster periods that last less than two months, we suggest initial preventive therapy with glucocorticoids alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We prefer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 60 to 100 mg once a day for at least five days, followed by a taper with a dose reduction of 10 mg daily.
