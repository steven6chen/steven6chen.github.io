The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as expulsion or extraction of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 g or less. The term &quot;fetus&quot; will be used throughout this discussion, although the term &quot;embryo&quot; is the correct term at &le;10 weeks of gestation.</p><p>The management of spontaneous abortion, with a focus on the first trimester, is discussed here. The risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and classification of spontaneous abortion are discussed separately.

Use of pharmacologic therapy (eg, estrogen, vitamins) has not been found to be effective. Most miscarriages are not preventable, since chromosomal abnormalities account for approximately 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials found no benefit of progestin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A limitation of this analysis was that it included both women with and without prior miscarriage, and women with recurrent miscarriage (two or more miscarriages) are typically considered a distinct patient population. Randomized trials of combined estrogen and progestin therapy have not evaluated use in average risk women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A meta-analysis of 28 randomized trials found no benefit of vitamin supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, one observational study found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation (&gt;730 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day)</span> was associated with a decreased risk of miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Further study is needed to determine whether additional folic acid supplementation should be recommended, since pregnancy women are already advised to take 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid daily to prevent neural tube defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation and management of couples with recurrent spontaneous abortion are discussed separately.

Treatment with progestins is the most promising treatment for threatened abortion, but its efficacy has not been established.</p><p>The use of progestins to reduce the risk of miscarriage among women with threatened abortion is controversial. This was evaluated in a meta-analysis that included four randomized trials with a total of 421 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The rate of spontaneous abortion was statistically significantly lower with progestin treatment compared with either placebo or no treatment (14 versus 26 percent; relative risk 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.79). Progestins were administered either orally or vaginally, and a subgroup analysis found a significant decrease in the rate of abortion only for oral progestins; the analysis of vaginal progestins lacked sufficient statistical power to detect a difference. There was no significant increase in congenital anomalies or pregnancy-induced hypertension in the progestin group. Another meta-analysis of five randomized trials (only one trial was included in the meta-analysis described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]) included 660 women with threatened abortion treated with the oral progestin dydrogesterone (not available in the United States), compared with placebo or supportive care (eg, bed rest) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There was a significant decrease in the rate of miscarriage in the progestin group (13 versus 24 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.7).</p><p>The results of these analyses appear promising; however, these analyses were limited by the small number of participants and events and poor methodologic quality of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Many miscarriages are caused by genetic abnormalities in the conceptus. It is unlikely that progestins could prevent a miscarriage of this etiology. The data are insufficient to make a recommendation for or against progestins for women with threatened abortion.</p><p>Other medications that have been investigated for threatened abortion include human chorionic gonadotropin, uterine muscle relaxants (eg, tocolytics, beta-agonists), vitamin supplementation, and Chinese herbal medicine, but high-quality data do not support their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Physical activity precautions are often advised for women with threatened abortion. Bed rest is commonly recommended, but randomized trials have not found that bed rest at home or in the hospital is beneficial in preventing fetal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Abstinence from sexual intercourse and physical exertion is also typically advised, although there are no data to support this. In our practice, we advise patients to avoid vigorous activity, heavy lifting, and sexual intercourse, but do not prescribe bed rest.</p><p>In our practice, we manage patients with threatened abortion expectantly. We counsel patients about the risk of miscarriage and advise them to call with additional vaginal bleeding, pelvic cramping, or passage of tissue from the vagina. We repeat a pelvic ultrasound weekly until a viable pregnancy is confirmed or excluded. If the patient has a viable pregnancy and symptoms have resolved, she may resume routine prenatal care. If symptoms continue, the patient should be monitored with ultrasound and pelvic examination to assess for progression to a missed, inevitable, incomplete, or complete abortion. She should also undergo further evaluation for other etiologies of bleeding during pregnancy.

These types of spontaneous abortion are defined as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inevitable abortion refers to cases in which the patient has vaginal bleeding, typically accompanied by crampy pelvic pain, and the cervix is dilated. Products of conception can often be felt or visualized through the internal cervical os.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete abortion refers to cases in which vaginal bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain are present, the cervix is dilated, and products of conception are found within the cervical canal on examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Missed abortion refers to a spontaneous abortion in a patient with or without symptoms and with a closed cervical os.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526856\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a treatment method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with an incomplete, inevitable, or missed abortion can be managed with surgical (dilation and curettage) or medication (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>) uterine evacuation or with expectant management. All three approaches have similar efficacy, and the choice of treatment method depends mainly upon patient preference.</p><p>We suggest surgical management for women who do not want to wait for a pregnancy to pass spontaneously or with medication evacuation and who wish to avoid the experience of pain and bleeding that accompanies the passage of the products of conception. In addition, surgical evacuation is required for women with heavy bleeding or intrauterine sepsis in whom delaying therapy could be harmful. It is also required for women with contraindications to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or who have medical comorbidities and need a controlled method of uterine evacuation in a hospital setting (eg, coagulopathy). (See <a href=\"#H1042103879\" class=\"local\">'Septic abortion'</a> below.)</p><p>On the other hand, some women prefer to avoid surgery and anesthesia. This may be due to a concern about risks or may be due to a preference to pass the pregnancy without instrumentation. For these women, options include either expectant management or medication evacuation.</p><p>Some women prefer medication rather than expectant management to expedite the process and potentially increase the likelihood of success. Other women may prefer to avoid medication.</p><p>Surgery, medication, and expectant management have comparable efficacy for uterine evacuation in women with a first-trimester miscarriage. This has been demonstrated in systematic reviews of randomized trials of women with first-trimester missed or incomplete abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p>Surgical uterine evacuation has several advantages over other methods, including: a shorter time to completion of treatment. Systematic reviews of randomized trials have found that complete evacuation within 48 hours is more likely with surgical than medical management and more likely with medical than expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p>Surgical treatment also lowers risk of unplanned hospital admissions and need for subsequent treatment. This was best illustrated in the MIST randomized trial, the only trial to compare all three treatment strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Women with spontaneous abortion at &lt;13 weeks of gestation (n = 1200) were assigned to expectant, medication (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>), or surgical management. There were significantly more unplanned hospital admissions in the expectant and medication group, compared with the surgical management group (49 versus 18 versus 8 percent). Surgical management was required in 44 percent of women in the expectant management group and 13 percent in the medication group, while 5 percent of women in the surgical group required further surgical intervention.</p><p>Surgery has the potential for operative complications, but these occur infrequently with dilation and curettage. In the MIST trial, there was a 1 to 2 percent incidence of surgical complications and 2 to 3 percent incidence of infection for all three groups. Blood transfusions were required in 2 percent of women in the expectant management group, 1 percent in the medication group, and no patients in the surgery group.</p><p>Regarding future reproductive outcomes, in the MIST trial, at five years, there was no significant difference in live birth rates across the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In terms of cost, based upon the MIST trial data, surgical evacuation was the most cost-effective method, but the differences were small (1086, 1410, and 1585 Great British pounds for surgical, medication, and expectant management, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Further, cost analyses depend on several factors, including the scope of costs considered in the analysis and the community in which the costs are incurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p>Medication evacuation appears to be associated with a lower risk of surgical intervention than expectant management, but data are inconsistent. A randomized trial that included women with any type of spontaneous abortion (including complete abortion) at &lt;14 weeks&rsquo; gestation (n = 182) compared sequential management (expectant management for one week, and if unsuccessful, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>) with immediate treatment with mifepristone and misoprostol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The sequential treatment group required significantly higher rates of surgical evacuation overall (44 versus 19 percent), emergency surgical evacuations (20 versus 5 percent), and emergency room visits (34 versus 17 percent).</p><p>By contrast, a meta-analysis including three randomized trials with a total of 335 women compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> treatment with expectant management for incomplete abortion and found no significant difference in the rate of complete (average risk ratio [ARR] 1.23, 95% CI 0.72-2.10) or in the need for surgical evacuation (ARR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17-2.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the analysis lacked sufficient statistical power.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical evacuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical treatment of first- or early second-trimester failed pregnancy is with dilation and curettage (D&amp;C). This procedure involves dilation of the cervix followed by removal of the pregnancy with sharp curettage, suction curettage, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The procedure is typically performed under intravenous conscious sedation and a paracervical block. Prophylactic antibiotics are given (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 1</a>). The procedure is generally performed in an operating room or procedure room, but some clinicians perform uterine evacuation as an office procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Beginning at 16 weeks gestation, dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) is the preferred procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The procedure involves wide mechanical dilation of the cervix, destruction of the fetal parts, and removal of all tissue with a large-bore vacuum curette. Cervical dilation may require several days of preparation and the procedure is typically performed in an operating room under general anesthesia.</p><p>Ultrasound guidance is not required, but performing curettage or evacuation under ultrasound guidance may help the surgeon guide the placement of the instruments during the procedure. Ultrasound visualization of a thin endometrial stripe at the end of the curettage assures the surgeon that the majority of the pregnancy tissue has been removed. Hysteroscopic guidance may be used if there is a uterine septum.</p><p>Potential complications include: anesthesia-related complications, uterine perforation, cervical trauma, and infection. Intrauterine adhesions may develop, which might lead to subsequent infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Its safety and efficacy have been established by multiple randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Misoprostol has several advantages over other drugs, including prostaglandin E2. It is low-cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], has a low incidence of side effects, is stable at room temperature, is readily available, and the timing of use can be controlled by the patient. In addition, clinical assessment and subsequent misoprostol administration can be safely performed by appropriately trained non-clinician providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

A classic history of complete abortion is several hours of vaginal bleeding with uncomfortable pelvic cramping, followed by passage of tissue and a decrease or resolution of bleeding and cramping.</p><p>The patient should be examined to evaluate for ongoing bleeding and to confirm that the cervix is closed and that the uterine size is consistent with or smaller than gestational age.</p><p>If possible, the tissue should be examined to confirm that it is (or is not) the products of conception. Ultrasound examination may be useful for patients who continue to bleed or have pelvic or abdominal pain.

This includes bleeding and uterine cramping. The bleeding typically starts as spotting or light bleeding (less than the volume of a period) and then reaches its heaviest flow for two to four hours while the tissue is expelled. This coincides with the pattern of pain, which is typically absent or dull and crampy and then increases to intense pain during expulsion. The pain then typically decreases and a dull ache or crampy feeling may remain intermittently for up to two weeks. An over-the-counter nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>) may be taken if the patient has no contraindications. Some patients may experience nausea or vomiting.

Septic abortion is uncommon in women with spontaneous abortion and is more frequently associated with induced abortion.

Intravenous antibiotics are administered until the patient has improved and been afebrile for 48 hours, then are typically followed by oral antibiotics to complete a 10- to 14-day course. The need to complete a full course with oral antibiotics after clinical improvement has been questioned based upon data from a randomized trial that found no difference in women who received only a short course of intravenous therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Care should be taken with uterine instrumentation since the risk of perforation is high in a gravid, infected uterus. In addition, all the products of conception should be evacuated with suction evacuation and a gritty texture obtained with a sharp curette.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-adhesions-clinical-manifestation-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Evacuation of the uterus should begin <strong>promptly</strong> after initiating antibiotics and stabilizing the patient in cases of suspected septic abortion or retained products of conception as delay in evacuation may be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Suction curettage is less traumatic than sharp curettage. Indications for further surgery and possible hysterectomy include failure to respond to uterine evacuation and antibiotics, pelvic abscess, and clostridial necrotizing myonecrosis (gas gangrene). A discolored, woody appearance of the uterus and adnexa, suspected clostridial sepsis, crepitation of the pelvic tissue, and radiographic evidence of air within the uterine wall are indications for total hysterectomy and adnexectomy.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preconceptual and prenatal counseling and care regarding modifiable etiologies and risk factors (eg, maternal disease, teratogens, infections) are the most important interventions for prevention of spontaneous abortion in women with no prior history of miscarriage. (See <a href=\"#H1042103972\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with threatened abortion are managed expectantly until their symptoms resolve or there is progression to an inevitable, incomplete, or complete abortion. Treatment with progestins is under investigation, but the data are insufficient to make a recommendation. Other interventions, including bed rest, treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin, muscle relaxants, or vitamin supplementation have not been found to be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Threatened abortion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with an incomplete, inevitable, or missed abortion can be managed surgically, with medication, or expectantly. All three management approaches are effective, but treatment is completed more quickly with surgical management and involves fewer medical visits. The choice of method is typically based upon patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H526856\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a treatment method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a spontaneous abortion who do not want to wait for a pregnancy to pass either spontaneously or with medication evacuation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who wish to avoid the experience of pain and bleeding that accompanies the passage of the products of conception, we recommend surgical evacuation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In addition, surgical evacuation is required for women with heavy bleeding or intrauterine sepsis in whom delaying therapy could be harmful and in women with contraindications to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>. (See <a href=\"#H526856\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a treatment method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who prefer to avoid surgery and anesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who prefer to pass the pregnancy without instrumentation, options include either expectant management or medication evacuation. Some women prefer medication rather than expectant management to expedite the process and potentially increase the likelihood of success. Other women may prefer to avoid medication entirely. Women who choose these options should be counseled about the 10 to 20 percent risk that surgical evacuation will be required if uterine evacuation is incomplete. (See <a href=\"#H526856\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a treatment method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with spontaneous abortion managed expectantly for four weeks, we suggest surgical or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> evacuation rather than continued expectant management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Expectant management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential complications of treatment of spontaneous abortion include: hemorrhage, uterine perforation, retained products of conception, and infection. (See <a href=\"#H1042103979\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) values typically return to normal within two to four weeks after a completed abortion. After expectant management or medication evacuation of spontaneous abortion, many clinicians measure a serum hCG level weekly until it is undetectable. It is not common practice to do this after surgical evacuation. Other experts advise that follow-up hCG testing is unnecessary after any method of evacuation if normal menstrual cycles resume within four to six weeks. If hCG level do not return to undetectable, the patient should be evaluated for retained products of conception, an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, or gestational trophoblastic disease. (See <a href=\"#H1898086716\" class=\"local\">'hCG testing'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Regan L, Rai R.
