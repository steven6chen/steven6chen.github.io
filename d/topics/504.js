Gas may enter the circulation if the pulmonary vascular integrity is disrupted concomitantly with alveolar rupture from overdistention of the airspaces. This complication has been reported most frequently in adults who are mechanically ventilated for the acute respiratory distress syndrome and in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (hyaline membrane disease), but it can also occur in patients with other diagnoses including those who are mechanically ventilated during anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/2,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,51-54</a>].

Rapid ascent without exhalation can result in expansion of gas in the lungs and consequent alveolar rupture. If the pulmonary veins tear as the alveoli rupture, air can return to the left heart with the oxygenated blood and then embolize through the arterial system to produce tissue ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Alternatively, air bubbles may form in the venous system during ascent and embolize to the systemic circulation via a patent foramen ovale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-scuba-diving#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of SCUBA diving&quot;, section on 'Arterial gas embolism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009037991\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare case reports of air embolism have been reported during sexual intercourse (including orogenital sex), pregnancy, labor and delivery, and autoerotic practices (eg, vaginal insufflation of cocaine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]. Venous air embolism has also been described following insufflation of the urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. With the advent of plastic equipment and closed blood delivery systems, entry of large volumes of air into the venous system is no longer a problem with routine transfusions. However, significant amounts of air may be inadvertently transfused following the use of more complex transfusion systems, such as apheresis and blood salvage equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air embolism can be classified in to two types: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venous air embolism</strong> &ndash; Venous air embolism (also called pulmonary air embolism) occurs when air enters the systemic venous circulation and travels to the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation. (See <a href=\"#H952826036\" class=\"local\">'Venous air embolism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arterial air embolism</strong> &ndash; Arterial air embolism occurs when air enters the arterial circulation. Arterial air embolism can produce ischemia in any organ that has insufficient collateral circulation. It is typically a more serious occurrence than venous embolism. (See <a href=\"#H952826049\" class=\"local\">'Arterial air embolism'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>As a general rule of thumb, air embolism can occur when the following is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/1,2,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,69,70</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct communication between a source of air and the vasculature</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pressure gradient favoring the passage of air into the circulation rather than bleeding from the vessel </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, surgical incision (communication between atmospheric air and the vasculature) in neurosurgical and otolaryngological procedures is usually superior to the heart at a distance that is greater than the central venous pressure. This sets up a condition of negative venous pressure relative to the atmosphere, which favors the passage of air into the circulation, especially when the patient is in a sitting position (ie, Fowler&rsquo;s position) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/5,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,71</a>]. This explains why these surgeries are at higher risk than others for venous air embolism. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Surgery and trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>As another example, hypovolemia causes subatmospheric pressure in veins (ie, collapsable veins) such that when they are incised during venous catheter insertion, the pressure gradient is in favor of air moving from the atmosphere into the vein.

The pathophysiologic effects can be direct or indirect:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Direct</strong> &ndash; Small amounts of air can be removed from the pulmonary vascular bed by gas diffusion across the arteriolar wall and into the alveolar spaces. However, when the capacity of the lung to remove gas is exceeded (eg, 50 mL or more) pulmonary outflow tract obstruction with or without concomitant arterial embolization can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obstruction &ndash; The pulmonary outflow tract, pulmonary arterioles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary microcirculation become obstructed resulting in circulatory collapse (ie obstructive shock) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H104104293\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Obstructive'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Large bubbles tend to obstruct the pulmonary outflow tract (known as &ldquo;air lock&rdquo;). This diminishes blood flow from the right heart, resulting in increased central venous pressure, decreased pulmonary arterial pressure, and decreased systemic arterial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Smaller bubbles tend to lodge within the pulmonary arterioles or pulmonary microcirculation, directly impeding blood flow and inducing vasoconstriction. As a result, the following hemodynamic effects may be observed: increased pulmonary vascular resistance, increased pulmonary arterial pressure, and increased right ventricular pressure. There may be an initial brief increase in the cardiac output and systemic arterial pressure due to tachycardia followed by a decrease in cardiac output and systemic arterial pressure, as well as myocardial ischemia due to hypoxia, right ventricular overload, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> air emboli to the coronary arterial circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/1,7,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial embolization &ndash; Venous air may pass through the pulmonary capillaries, enter the arterial circulation, and cause arterial air embolization with organ ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H952826049\" class=\"local\">'Arterial air embolism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Detrimental effects of venous gas embolism are determined by the total volumes of air injected as well as the rate and the final location. It is estimated that 300 to 500 mL of gas introduced at a rate of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> can be acutely fatal for humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/2,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40</a>].

Other estimates suggest that 50 mL of venous air can also be fatal. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indirect</strong> &ndash; Secondary effects of air embolism can also result in end organ damage. As an example, air bubbles in the pulmonary microcirculation are associated with local endothelial damage and the accumulation of neutrophils, platelets, fibrin, and lipid droplets at the gas-fluid interface. Additional endothelial damage may be caused by the activation of complement and the release of mediators and free radicals from neutrophils and other inflammatory cells. Consequences of the endothelial damage may include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (ie, adult respiratory distress-like picture), bronchoconstriction, and physiological changes, such as hypoxemia (due to alveolar flooding and ventilation-perfusion mismatching), increased physiologic dead space (with a rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub> if ventilation is held constant), decreased lung compliance (secondary to pulmonary edema), and increased airway resistance (may be due to release of bronchoconstricting mediators such as serotonin and histamine from damaged endothelium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/1,7,40,74-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,40,74-79</a>].

CT chest, particularly CT pulmonary angiography is frequently performed to determine the cause of dyspnea and rule out venous thromboembolism. CT is probably more sensitive than chest radiography for the detection of air, but because it is often delayed, bedside chest radiography should be done first in every case of suspected venous air embolism. In general, the sensitivity and specificity of radiologic imaging findings are poor. This is because imaging is often normal (ie, falsely negative) due to the rapid absorption of air as testing is being arranged. As an example, one study of 17 patients with cerebral arterial gas embolism reported a sensitivity of 25 percent for imaging (mostly CT and MRI) in detecting cerebral air and 50 percent for the detection of secondary effects of cerebral air (ie, infarcts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of CT are greatest when large defects are detected because small (&lt;1 mL), asymptomatic air emboli of uncertain clinical significance (from contrast material) are detectable in 10 to 25 percent of contrast-enhanced CT scans if carefully sought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/44,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,91</a>].

Consequently, it is often used during neurosurgical procedures for the preclinical detection of cerebral air. It has not been formally compared with CT or MRI of the brain. In addition, capnography can be readily used to detect a reduction in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>; however, end-tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>is also nonspecific and can occur with pulmonary embolism, massive blood loss, circulatory arrest, or disconnection from the anesthesia circuit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

Vasopressors should be administered to those who fail resuscitation with intravenous fluids. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravenous access</strong> &ndash; Peripheral venous access (14 to 18 gauge catheters) is typically sufficient for the initial evaluation and management of many patients with suspected air embolism. Central venous access should be obtained in those in whom peripheral access cannot be obtained, in those who need infusions of large volumes of fluids, or for the ongoing infusion of vasopressors. Central venous access may also be useful in patients who require frequent blood draws for laboratory studies and for hemodynamic monitoring (eg, central venous pressure, central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation). Regardless of the form of access, care during placement and use should be taken such that new air is not introduced into the vascular space. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment of generalized seizures and secondary effects of embolism</strong> &ndash; The approach to treating seizures and other secondary effects of air embolism, (eg, acute lung or kidney injury) is the same as for other general medical patients, which are discussed in detail separately.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009040456\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient with <strong>venous</strong> air embolization should be immediately placed into the left lateral decubitus position (Durant&rsquo;s maneuver), Trendelenburg position, or left lateral decubitus head down position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. These positions place the right ventricular outflow tract inferior to the right ventricular cavity, causing the air to migrate superiorly into a position within the right ventricle from which air is less likely to embolize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/1,2,6,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6,40</a>]. The potential benefit of appropriate positioning was suggested by an animal experiment in which 40 percent of animals in the left lateral decubitus position survived the venous injection of a lethal amount of air (the experiment did not assess the left lateral decubitus head down or Trendelenburg position) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, a patient with <strong>arterial</strong> air embolism should be placed in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The reason that the optimal position differs for arterial and venous air embolism is that arterial blood flow is more forceful than venous blood flow and air bubbles are propelled forward by the arterial blood flow even if the patient is in a head down position. Since the head down positions have the potential to exacerbate the cerebral edema that is typically induced by cerebral air embolism, a flat supine position is also favored for this reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/70,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009039891\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific interventions (hyperbaric oxygen, withdrawal of air from the right atrium, cardiac massage) can be used in select cases to reduce bubble size (hyperbaric oxygen) or remove air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/1,2,40,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,40,98</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009039280\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperbaric oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is not routinely administered in patients with air embolism but is a useful adjunct in severe cases, which is often those with arterial air embolization. When available, HBO should be administered to patients with evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary compromise, as well as those with neurologic deficits, or other evidence of end-organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>]. We prefer that HBO be administered within the first four to six hours after symptom onset but continued benefit has been reported when HBO therapy is delayed for up to 30 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. The potential benefits of HBO must be weighed against the potential risks of transport to the HBO facility where it is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The potential clinical benefits of HBO are mostly derived from small retrospective case series that examine patients with neurologic deficit from air embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/102,103,105-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103,105-107</a>]. These studies are limited by small sample size, their retrospective design and lack of adjustment for severity of illness. Nonetheless, collectively they report benefit particularly when HBO is administered within the first four to six hours after symptom onset. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective cohort study of 86 patients with venous or arterial air embolism, patients treated with HBO within six hours of presentation were more likely to recover than patients who received HBO after six hours or more (68 versus 40 percent), with outcomes best in those who underwent HBO within three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case series of 17 patients treated with HBO for air embolism that developed during cardiac surgery, all five patients who were treated within three hours from the operation and half (two out of four) of those treated three to five hours from operation experienced a full neurologic recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. With a delay of 9 to 20 hours, only one (out of eight) patients had a full neurologic recovery. </p><p/><p>HBO provides oxygen at pressures higher than atmospheric pressure and at 100 percent concentration such that a &ldquo;supra&rdquo; physiologic level of systemic hyperoxia can be achieved (ie, greater than that provided by 100 percent oxygen). Typically, a partial pressure of oxygen &gt;2000 mmHg can be achieved with HBO (compared with &lt;600 mmHg with 100 percent oxygen via face mask). This degree of hyperoxia allows enormous gradients for nitrogen to be displaced from inside the air bubble, which in turn, reduces air bubble size and the degree of mechanical obstruction to end arterial blood flow. In addition, the increase in the arterial oxygen tension improves oxygen delivery and ameliorates tissue ischemia. The mechanisms and clinical applications of HBO therapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HBO is of limited availability and only highly specialized centers have expertise in the provision of this therapy. It is an intermittent therapy that often requires physical transfer of patients which can infer risk of cardiac arrest or death during transfer. Thus, the benefits of HBO therapy should be weighed against the risk of death during transfer and discussed with the patients and caregivers in every case. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009039632\"><span class=\"h3\">Manual removal of embolized air</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air has been successfully aspirated from the right ventricle via a central venous catheter, pulmonary artery catheter, or percutaneously introduced needle, according to case reports and experimental models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/air-embolism/abstract/40,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,96</a>].

Surgery, trauma, vascular interventions, and barotrauma from mechanical ventilation and diving are the most common causes of air embolism. These and other less common causes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56802 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air embolism requires direct communication between a source of air and the vasculature, as well as a pressure gradient favoring the passage of air into the circulation. Venous air embolism is a consequence of air being introduced into the venous circulation, traveling to the right heart, and lodging in the pulmonary circulation. Arterial air emboli may be a consequence of incomplete filtration of venous air emboli by the lung, the introduction of air directly into the arterial system, or paradoxical embolization. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air embolism should always be suspected when patients experience sudden-onset respiratory distress (venous air embolism) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> experience a neurological event (arterial embolism) in the setting of a known risk factor (eg, intravenous catheter insertion, trauma). The spectrum of clinical findings depends upon the degree of severity of embolism, end-organs affected, and underlying comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76772 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minor cases of <strong>venous</strong> air embolism are common, cause minimal or no symptoms, and are often transient and self-resolving. In more severe cases, dyspnea is almost a universal finding and may be accompanied by substernal chest pain, lightheadedness, or dizziness. Immediately life-threatening cases are characterized by acute-onset right-sided heart failure, an acute sense of impending doom, sudden-onset loss of consciousness, hemodynamic collapse (from obstructive shock), or cardiac arrest. Signs include a gasp, cough, or sucking noise, a mill wheel murmur, tachypnea, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, wheezing, crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The symptoms and signs of <strong>arterial </strong>embolism vary depending on the organ affected (usually the brain) so that many patients present with an acute change in mental status <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> focal neurological deficits. Severe cases may present with loss of consciousness, coma, and cardiac arrest. Additional features include the signs of acute ischemia of affected organs, including the heart and skin, resulting in chest pain, wheeze, crepitus over superficial vessels, livedo reticularis, and bubbles within retinal arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with suspected air embolism include all those that can cause acute pulmonary, cardiovascular, or neurological decompensation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67564\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67564 \">table 4</a>). There are no pathognomic features of air embolism that distinguish it from other forms of embolism or acute decompensation other than the demonstration of air on imaging. (See <a href=\"#H2823387\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is best made by demonstrating air in the intravascular space or organs in a patient with a known risk factor for air embolism. However, because air may be rapidly absorbed from the circulation while waiting for diagnostic imaging, air embolism is typically a retrospective clinical diagnosis, based upon a high index of suspicion and the exclusion of other life-threatening processes. (See <a href=\"#H1009038370\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected air embolism, we suggest the following strategy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients should be rapidly assessed for airway stability, breathing, and circulation, and appropriate supportive therapies should be administered (eg, high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, volume resuscitation, vasopressors, advanced cardiac life support). For all patients suspected as having air embolism, we recommend the administration of supplemental oxygen with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Although the optimal FiO<sub>2</sub> or oxyhemoglobin saturation level is unknown, we prefer to start with the highest level of FiO<sub>2 </sub>to achieve the highest saturation as tolerated by the patient. (See <a href=\"#H1457061785\" class=\"local\">'Supportive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with suspected <strong>venous</strong> air embolism, we recommend placing the patient in the left lateral decubitus head down position, rather than leaving the patient supine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The left lateral decubitus and Trendelenburg positions are acceptable alternatives. Conversely, for patients with <strong>arterial</strong> air embolism, we suggest placing the patient in the supine position rather than head down positions. (See <a href=\"#H1009040456\" class=\"local\">'Positioning the patient'</a> above.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with suspected air embolism, simultaneous with initial assessment, the following diagnostic tests should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81655 \">table 3</a>): complete blood count and differential, serum chemistries, creatine phosphokinase, serum troponin-I or -T, brain natriuretic peptide, arterial blood gas analysis, chest radiography, and electrocardiography. Additional testing depends upon the suspected source of air and location of potential end organ damage and may include transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography (if intracardiac air is suspected), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary arteries (if venous air embolism is suspected), and contrast-enhanced CT of the brain (if cerebral embolism is suspected). (See <a href=\"#H1009038364\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with air embolism, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is <strong>not</strong> routinely administered. When available, HBO should be administered to patients with evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary compromise, as well as to those with neurologic deficits or other evidence of end-organ damage. We prefer that HBO be administered within the first four to six hours after symptom onset but continued benefit has been reported when HBO therapy is delayed for up to 30 hours. The potential benefits of HBO must be weighed against the potential risks of transport to the HBO facility where it is administered. The aspiration of air from the right ventricle using a preexisting central venous catheter and closed-chest cardiac massage (ie, chest compressions) are last resort therapies that may be attempted in patients who are in extremis due to air embolism.
