The child and caregivers should receive instruction regarding the proper use of the medication delivery system(s) prescribed to ensure that the child receives the full benefit of the medication(s).

It is rarely used due to potential side effects and numerous drug interactions, the need to monitor serum levels, and the superior efficacy of other controller medications. However, theophylline may have some utility in patients who are not adherent with or have technical difficulties using inhaled medications and who are unable to tolerate or have failed to respond to an LTRA.

Combination therapy with inhaled glucocorticoids and LABA should be restricted to children who fail to achieve adequate asthma control with medium<strong>-</strong>dose inhaled glucocorticoids.

They act by inhibiting most steps in the cascade of the inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-treatment-of-persistent-asthma-with-controller-medications/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The benefits of glucocorticoids include reduced bronchial hyperresponsiveness, prevention of the late asthmatic response, and enhanced lung function. Inhaled glucocorticoids can be delivered directly to the airways at a fraction of the dose used systemically, with minimal side effects. Furthermore, much of the small amount of drug that is absorbed at low doses is deactivated after one pass through the liver.
