OSA is the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 4 males and 1 in 10 females for mild OSA, and 1 in 9 males and 1 in 20 females for moderate OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. OSA has been increasing in prevalence over the last two decades in parallel with the increase in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Over half of patients with OSA who present for surgery are undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The incidence of perioperative complications is greater in patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>], leading the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and others to develop clinical practice guidelines and protocols for the perioperative management of patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/3,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-14</a>]. Recommendations include maintaining a high index of suspicion for OSA, careful use of medications, vigilant monitoring for upper airway obstruction, and an integrated team approach to perioperative management. There is little direct evidence that these precautions improve outcomes, so recommendations are generally based upon indirect evidence, clinical rationale, and expert opinion.</p><p>The intraoperative management of patients with OSA is reviewed here, using risk mitigation strategies and precautions. This includes determining whether the surgery should be performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis, anesthesia techniques, premedication, and airway management. The increase in perioperative complications, preoperative evaluation and management, and postoperative management of patients with OSA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical risk and the preoperative evaluation and management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515569907\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the choice of anesthetic technique is determined by the surgical procedure and preferences of the patient, anesthesiologist, and surgeon. Patient-related factors such as airway concerns and high levels of anxiety also influence the choice of technique.</p><p>In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a general principle is to use an anesthetic technique that minimizes the use of respiratory depressants whose effects will continue into the postoperative period. Most anesthetic techniques can be modified to conform to this goal.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitored anesthesia care (MAC)</strong> is the provision of close monitoring by an anesthesia provider with sedative and analgesic medications as needed, while the surgeon is responsible for pain relief using local anesthetic. While this approach may lead to unacceptable respiratory depression in patients with high sedative requirements (eg, extremely anxious patients), this concern can be mitigated by choosing short-acting or nonrespiratory depressant sedatives as discussed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral nerve blocks</strong> may be used as the sole anesthetic, or in conjunction with general anesthesia to lower anesthetic and analgesic doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Use of nerve blocks as the sole anesthetic removes the need to control the airway, although block failure may necessitate back-up general anesthesia. Long-acting blocks (long-acting local anesthetics or a continuous infusion via a catheter) used for postoperative analgesia may eliminate the need for postoperative opioids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuraxial anesthesia</strong> (spinal or epidural) may be the sole anesthetic or combined with general anesthesia. As with peripheral nerve blocks, neuraxial anesthesia lowers dosing requirements for anesthetic agents and opioids. Another advantage is that when neuraxial anesthesia is used as the sole anesthetic, airway management is not needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is some evidence that neuraxial anesthesia leads to lower perioperative complications than general anesthesia in OSA patients. For example, in a retrospective population-based study of over 30,000 patients with OSA having hip or knee arthroplasty, the use of neuroaxial anesthesia was associated with lower overall major complications as compared with general or combined general-neuraxial anesthesia, 16 versus 17 or 18 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The odds of pulmonary complications were also lower with neuraxial compared with general anesthesia (odds ratio 0.825). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General anesthesia </strong>is required for many surgical procedures and is requested by many patients. Before choosing general anesthesia, patients should be carefully assessed for potentially difficult airway management. When general anesthesia is planned, the addition of a regional technique may decrease opioid requirements.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202862700\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several strategies and precautions used in the intraoperative and immediate perioperative period may mitigate the anesthetic risks in the patient with known or presumed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93968\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93968 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257787\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication with sedatives or opioids in patients with OSA should not be administered routinely. These patients are vulnerable to depression of upper airway muscle activity by sedatives, which may precipitate upper airway obstruction. If premedication is necessary, it is prudent to use a continuous oxyhemoglobin saturation monitor and to establish intravenous access for administration of antagonist agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>) if required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Patients with OSA, particularly obese patients, may be more likely to have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. When these patients are felt to be at risk of aspiration, we premedicate with prophylactic agents (eg, proton pump inhibitors, non-particulate antacids). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia#H107497733\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Preoperative antacids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67394135\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitored anesthesia care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with OSA, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) anesthesia should minimize use of sedative agents because of their respiratory-depressant effects. Oxygenation and ventilation should be continuously monitored throughout surgery via pulse oximetry and capnography, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

OSA patients are also particularly susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of these medications because of the blunted physiologic response to hypercarbia and hypoxia in OSA. Both respiratory depression and respiratory muscle inhibition continue into the postoperative recovery period, so there may be advantages to short-acting anesthetic agents that allow rapid emergence with less ongoing sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Almost all aspects of airway management in patients with OSA are more difficult than in other patients, including maintenance of a patent airway in an unintubated, sedated (spontaneously breathing or mask ventilated) patient, supraglottic airway device (SGA) placement and ventilation, and laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.</p><p>The general principles for the management of difficult airways should be adapted to the patient with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reassess</strong> the patient for physical factors related to airway management and recent changes in medical conditions.

Patients should be preoxygenated with a tight-fitting face mask for several minutes; oxygenation and ventilation may be improved using airway-opening maneuvers, mask-assistance, CPAP, and nasopharyngeal airways. Optimal preoxygenation will prolong the period before oxygen desaturation during apnea, especially in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202862729\"><span class=\"h3\">Mask ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mask ventilation is the most basic technique for any patient with hypoventilation or hypoxemia. The fact that mask ventilation is more difficult in patients with OSA can lead to critical problems in both routine and emergent situations. Patients who are poorly mask ventilated during the period between induction and laryngoscopy are more likely to desaturate during prolonged laryngoscopy (which occurs when patients are difficult to intubate, such as the patient with OSA). In addition, when mask ventilation is needed as an emergent rescue technique in patients who cannot be intubated, inability to mask ventilate can be fatal.</p><p>An observational study found that 5 percent of the general adult population is difficult to mask (by a single anesthesiologist) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

However, the failure rate may be higher in patients with OSA, as two of the four risk factors for LMA failure, male gender and increased body mass index, are also associated with OSA. Obese patients may benefit from use of second-generation devices, which allow for higher seal pressures and provide a gastric vent.

Predictors of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation (eg, high Mallampati score, decreased thyromental distance, increase in neck circumference, crowded oropharynx) are common in OSA. OSA, especially severe OSA, also predicts difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation, independent of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

This may mitigate the respiratory depressant effects of opioids, which are exaggerated in OSA: central respiratory depression, upper airway obstruction, and decreased level of consciousness, with consequent alveolar hypoventilation and hypoxemia.

A general principle for patients with OSA is to use an anesthetic technique that minimizes the use of respiratory depressants whose effects will continue into the postoperative period. (See <a href=\"#H515569907\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with OSA are sensitive to the respiratory-depressant effects of sedatives and opioids, which may be mitigated by lower doses and use of shorter-acting agents. Reversal agents should be available. (See <a href=\"#H257787\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal positioning for airway patency, airway adjuncts, and use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be helpful in minimizing airway problems during monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Oxygenation and ventilation should be continuously monitored (most often with pulse oximetry and capnography). (See <a href=\"#H67394135\" class=\"local\">'Monitored anesthesia care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During general anesthesia, short-acting anesthetic agents may shorten emergence and decrease postoperative respiratory depression. (See <a href=\"#H75932529\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with OSA are at higher risk of having a difficult airway (mask ventilation, supraglottic airway ventilation, laryngoscopy, and intubation). Clinical practice guidelines on the management of difficult airways should be followed by having basic and emergency equipment immediately accessible, a primary and alternative airway management strategy, and skilled assistance immediately available. (See <a href=\"#H66026087\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maneuvers to improve oxygenation and ventilation due to difficult mask ventilation include (see <a href=\"#H202862729\" class=\"local\">'Mask ventilation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H67396004\" class=\"local\">'Supraglottic airways'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use head-up positioning with several minutes of preoxygenation with a tight-fitting mask prior to inducing general anesthesia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Try two nasopharyngeal airways and an oropharyngeal airway, and optimize the sniffing position to maximally open the airway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Promptly use a two-person mask ventilation technique</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place a supraglottic airway (eg, laryngeal mask airway [LMA])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulties with laryngoscopy and intubation are common in OSA. Patients with a high suspicion of difficult mask and supraglottic airway ventilation and difficult intubation should be managed as having a difficult airway. Advanced airway techniques (eg, video laryngoscopes) or awake intubation should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H202862736\" class=\"local\">'Laryngoscopy and intubation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extubation of patients with OSA should take place in a head-up position, with airway reflexes intact, neuromuscular blocking agents reversed (if needed), and the patient adequately ventilating and responsive.
