While the majority of patients with chronic stable angina are treated with medical therapy, revascularization on top of medical therapy is the preferred treatment strategy in many clinical subgroups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Indications for revascularization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients who undergo revascularization receive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting, as opposed to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

Specialized revascularization devices such as rotational atherectomy (for severely calcified lesions) or laser angioplasty (for in-stent restenosis) have been evaluated in clinical trials.</p><p>Neither short- nor long-term benefits have been shown consistently with these revascularization devices. In particular, atherectomy devices have generally failed to improve patient survival or the durability of the revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These findings indicate that <strong>routine</strong> use of specialized device therapies (over the combination of balloon dilation and stent implantation) is not justified.</p><p>The use and efficacy of rotational atherectomy, cutting balloon atherectomy, and excimer laser angioplasty will be reviewed here. The complications associated with their use are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary complications of atheroablative devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the purpose of this topic, a specialized revascularization device is a catheter-based tool designed to address unique problems associated with certain lesions, such as those that are calcified. These devices have specialized functions used at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention and typically supplement or assist balloon angioplasty and the implantation of a stent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ROTATIONAL ATHERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotational atherectomy is performed with a rapidly rotating olive-shaped burr whose leading hemisphere is coated with microscopic diamond chips. Contact of the burr with fibrocalcific plaque grinds calcified atheroma into particles small enough to pass through the distal myocardial capillary bed. It was designed to both &quot;debulk a lesion&quot; and to remove calcified tissue that after might interfere with the ability of a percutaneous balloon to pass.</p><p>The routine use of rotational atherectomy during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was shown to not be useful in a meta-analysis of 16 device trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Using data from the four trials that evaluated rotational atherectomy, its routine use, compared to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) alone, was associated with significant increases in restenosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.25), myocardial infarction at 30 days (OR 2.18), and major adverse cardiac events at one year (OR 1.52).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcified and complex lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite these shortcomings, rotational atherectomy is valuable for heavily calcified lesions that cannot be treated successfully by balloon angioplasty or that interfere with a delivery of a stent to a more distal location. It is also used commonly for calcified ostial lesions of the right coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Uncontrolled results from a multicenter registry found that rotational atherectomy was successful (defined as less than 50 percent residual stenosis) in 94 percent of calcific lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of intracoronary stents for specific coronary lesions&quot;, section on 'Ostial lesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Use prior to stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no value in performing rotational atherectomy routinely before stenting. The ROTAXUS trial randomized 240 patients with complex calcified native coronary lesions to stenting using a paclitaxel-eluting stent with or without routine rotational atherectomy. At nine months, clinical outcomes of MACE, TLR, and definite stent thrombosis were not different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, rotational atherectomy does have utility prior to stenting when a proximal calcified segment prevents stent delivery or when there is a large plaque burden, which may interfere with optimal stent expansion and may be associated with an increased risk of in-stent restenosis. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal mammary artery graft stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although uncommon, stenosis within an internal mammary artery graft may cause recurrent ischemia after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). While such lesions are most often treated with balloon angioplasty, unsatisfactory results may occur when the lesion at the anastomotic site is rigid and fibrotic. Although data are limited to a small number of patients, rotational atherectomy may infrequently be needed for such lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Despite success reported from a retrospective, observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], a later randomized trial of 298 patients showed higher risk for recurrent restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>We do not generally use rotational atherectomy for treatment of in-stent restenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential complications of rotational atherectomy include severe coronary spasm, dissection, perforation, and slow flow through the capillary bed due to excessive particle embolization.

When rotational atherectomy is being considered, the weight of evidence or opinion was in favor of the efficacy of IVUS for establishing the presence and distribution of coronary calcium. However, in our practices, IVUS is rarely used for this indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865029575\"><span class=\"h1\">ORBITAL ATHERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orbital atherectomy, similar to rotational atherectomy, utilizes a rotating burr to ablate plaque into particles small enough to be cleared by the reticuloendothelial system. The device differs from rotational atherectomy in that the burr is flexible and the depth of plaque ablation can be changed by altering the speed of rotation. In the ORBIT II trial, 443 patients were treated with orbital atherectomy in an open-label registry. After atherectomy, successful stent delivery occurred in 98 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At 30 days, the incidence of primary efficacy end point (residual stenosis &lt;50 percent post-stent without in-hospital major adverse events) was 88.9 percent. Components of the combined end point included a cardiac mortality rate of 0.2 percent, myocardial infarction (defined as creatine kinase MB fraction &gt;three times the upper limit of normal) rate of 9.7 percent, and a target vessel revascularization rate of 1.4 percent.

It produces sharp, clean, longitudinal incisions, leaving the interincisional segments of the untreated segment intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It was proposed that this type of controlled dilatation might reduce the force needed to dilate an obstructive lesion.</p><p>An initial nonrandomized matched comparison suggested that the incidence of restenosis and target vessel revascularization was lower with cutting balloon angioplasty than with other methods of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This was not confirmed in the RESCUT trial that compared the cutting balloon to conventional angioplasty in 428 patients with in-stent restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] or in a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The lumen produced by the laser is 0.9 to 2.0 mm in diameter; as a result, laser angioplasty must be followed by the use of another device to achieve a satisfactory final result. The excimer laser has not found acceptance for general use based on lack of success and higher risk for coronary dissection and perforation in earlier trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In the meta-analysis of 16 device trials cited above, three trials evaluated laser angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specialized-revascularization-devices-in-the-management-of-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
