Generally, the full spectrum of cardiac lesions seen in a postnatal population can be detected in the fetus, with the exception of some minor lesions, such as secundum atrial septal defects, which are less likely to be diagnosed in the prenatal period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184758498\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR PRENATAL SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis of cardiac disease provides parents an opportunity to obtain prognostic information prior to birth, learn about treatment options before and after delivery, reach decisions concerning the management approach that is best for their family (eg, whether to terminate pregnancy or undergo in utero intervention, if available; nonintervention), and plan for specific needs at birth (eg, place of delivery, pediatric and obstetric providers, route of delivery, palliative care). It may also improve neonatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Given the complexity of these issues, referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, pediatric cardiologist, geneticist, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatologist is recommended.</p><p>There are few data on the impact of prenatal diagnosis on morbidity or mortality of affected fetuses, despite substantial experience in the identification of fetal cardiac anomalies. In a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies on the effect of prenatal diagnosis of critical congenital heart disease on neonatal mortality, prenatal diagnosis reduced mortality prior to planned cardiac surgery compared with postnatal diagnosis (pooled odds ratio 0.26; 95% CI 0.08&ndash;0.84; 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">death/207</span> prenatal diagnoses versus 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">deaths/821</span> postnatal diagnoses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The analysis was limited to patients with comparable anatomy, standard risk, a parental desire to treat, and optimal care. The small number of deaths precludes a clear conclusion about the benefit of prenatal diagnosis, and the observed survival benefit may not apply to newborns who have a prenatal diagnosis of noncritical congenital heart defects or who receive nonoptimal care.</p><p>Prenatal diagnosis of cardiac disease has also been associated with a reduction in neonatal morbidity, including severe acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Infants with congenital heart defects that require patency of the ductus arteriosus for systemic or pulmonary blood flow can benefit by early postnatal intervention (prostaglandin E1) to prevent closure of the ductus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Similarly, readiness to perform transcatheter intervention (eg, balloon atrial septostomy for patients with d-TGA or HLHS, balloon valvuloplasty for patients with critical pulmonic or aortic stenosis)or pacing of complete heart block soon after birth enables rapid stabilization of the postnatal circulation and thus may improve outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/4,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-9</a>].</p><p>In some cases, prenatal diagnosis also provides an opportunity for in utero treatment. Transplacental medical therapy improves the prognosis of some fetal arrhythmias, particularly tachycardias (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the general approach to diagnosis and treatment of fetal arrhythmias&quot;</a>). Invasive in utero cardiac intervention (eg, aortic or pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], atrial needle septoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] ) may improve the prognosis of some lesions, such as HLHS or severe valvular abnormalities (eg, severe mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, pulmonary atresia); however, these interventions are performed at only a few fetal surgery centers and are considered investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIMUM AGE FOR SCREENING FOR FETAL CARDIAC DEFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimum gestational age for screening for structural fetal cardiac anomalies is 18 to 22 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Fetal cardiac anatomy can be visualized well at this stage of pregnancy, a complete fetal anatomic survey can be performed, and there is time for further evaluation (eg, echocardiogram, chromosomal microarray), if indicated, while the fetus is still previable. After 30 weeks of gestation, it can be difficult to obtain good images as the fetus becomes more crowded within the amniotic cavity.</p><p>The structure of the fetal heart can be reasonably assessed as early as 10 weeks of gestation. In a 2006 systematic review of the accuracy of first-trimester ultrasound examination for detecting major congenital heart disease using transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound transducers or a combination of both methods (10 studies, n = 1243 patients), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 85 percent (95% CI 78-90) and 99 percent (95% CI 98-100), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, most of the studies were in populations with fetuses at increased risk of congenital heart disease.</p><p>It should be noted that some fetal cardiac conditions may not be detected until, or may first present after, 18 to 22 weeks of gestation. For example, fetal arrhythmias, <span class=\"nowrap\">myocarditis/cardiomyopathy,</span> heart failure, valvular insufficiency or obstruction, and cardiac tumors have variable onset. In addition, small ventricular or atrial septal defects, minor valve lesions, partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and coronary artery anomalies are often not detected prenatally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184751909\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC FETAL CARDIAC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3277190525\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommended views</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard, basic obstetrical ultrasound examination includes assessment of the four chambers and outflow tract of the fetal heart. The inclusion of views of the outflow tract increases the likelihood of identifying conotruncal anomalies such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, double outlet right ventricle and truncus arteriosus. This examination is consistent with practice guidelines for sonographic screening of the fetal heart available from the International Society for Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and the American Institute for Ultrasound in Medicine with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and the American College of Radiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Formal evaluation of rhythm and cardiac function are not part of a basic fetal cardiac evaluation.</p><p>A meta-analysis evaluating the performance of different fetal sonographic protocols for diagnosis of fetal structural heart disease found that inclusion of the outflow tract in the basic examination increased detection rates of structural cardiac disease substantially: sensitivity 65 to 90 percent (four chambers with outlet tract or outlet tract and three vessels with trachea views) versus 52 percent with the four-chamber view alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, there were wide variations in detection rates among screening studies, with some studies reporting only 15 percent detection of congenital heart disease. Factors affecting sensitivity include type of ultrasound practice (eg, university versus community hospital), operator training and experience, gestational age, maternal weight, fetal position, and type of defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Fetal echocardiography is a more sensitive, but less cost-effective, screening approach for pregnancies at low risk of congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184757147\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal cardiac imaging should always be performed with the highest possible transducer frequency to maximize image resolution, and at the highest possible frame rate (preferably &gt;50 Hz), due to the rapid movement of the heart, which normally beats at 120 to 160 beats per minute. The standard four-chamber view can be obtained in 95 to 98 percent of second trimester pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. It is obtained either from the long axis or apical view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61751\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61751 \">image 1</a>). Usually it is easiest to start with a standard abdominal circumference plane of the fetal abdomen and angle the transducer cephalad on the fetus. The four chambers of the fetal heart are seen with the left atrium most posterior and the right ventricle most anterior. The right and left atria and ventricles should be approximately symmetric in size. The heart should occupy about one third of the chest area.</p><p>In addition to the four-chamber view, sweeps through the outflow tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95753\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95753 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95754\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95754 \">image 3</a>) and the three-vessel view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95752\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95752 \">image 4</a>) with sweeps through the mediastinum should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/14,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,26</a>]. The mean axis of the fetal heart is approximately 45 degrees to the left of the midline (normal range 30 to 60 degrees). An increase in the axis can be a marker for outflow tract abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

Prenatal diagnosis provides parents an opportunity to obtain prognostic information prior to birth, learn about treatment options before and after delivery, reach decisions concerning the management approach that is best for their family, and plan for specific needs at birth. Depending on the lesion, prenatal diagnosis may reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H184758498\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for prenatal screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimum gestational age for screening for structural fetal cardiac anomalies is 18 to 22 weeks of gestation. However, some fetal cardiac conditions may not be detected until, or may first present, later in gestation. Fetal arrhythmias, <span class=\"nowrap\">myocarditis/cardiomyopathy,</span> heart failure, valvular insufficiency or obstruction, and cardiac tumors have variable onset. Small ventricular or atrial septal defects, minor valve lesions, partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and coronary artery anomalies are often not detected prenatally. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Optimum age for screening for fetal cardiac defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A basic fetal cardiac assessment should include a four-chamber view and the outflow tracts. (See <a href=\"#H184751909\" class=\"local\">'Basic fetal cardiac evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal echocardiography should be performed in fetuses at a higher risk of congenital heart disease than would be expected for the general population (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Advanced fetal cardiac evaluation'</a> above). We agree with American Heart Association (AHA), American Society of Echocardiography (ASE), and Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) guidance describing fetal, maternal, and familial factors conferring an increased risk of fetal cardiac disease. (See <a href=\"#H184758220\" class=\"local\">'Indications for echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed fetal anatomic survey should be performed. Extracardiac abnormalities are detected in at least 20 to 40 percent of fetuses with a cardiac defect. Approximately 4 percent of patients with cardiac anomalies have an identifiable syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H184757127\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for extracardiac anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increased risk of genetic abnormalities, particularly aneuploidy or 22q11 deletion, in these fetuses; the frequency of genetic abnormality depends on the specific lesion. The two main approaches for genetic testing are (1) G-banding of fetal cells obtained via amniocentesis, with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess for microdeletions, such as 22q11, not detectable by visual banding techniques, and (2) chromosomal microarray, which detects submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities in 5 percent of fetuses with ultrasound-detected anomalies and a normal G-band karyotype. Either approach is reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H184757325\" class=\"local\">'Genetic assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The necessity, timing, and frequency of follow-up ultrasound assessment should be guided by the nature and severity of the lesion, presence of heart failure, anticipated timing and mechanism of progression, and the options available for prenatal and postpartum intervention. We suggest at least one follow-up examination early in the third trimester to look for abnormalities that progressed in severity or may not have been detectable earlier in gestation. (See <a href=\"#H184757331\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery should be planned at a facility with the appropriate level of care for the mother and neonate. Early delivery and cesarean delivery are generally performed only for standard obstetrical indications.
