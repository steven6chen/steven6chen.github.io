After babies are weaned, they no longer drink breast milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713003\"><span class=\"h1\">How long should I breastfeed before weaning?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most doctors recommend that women breastfeed their baby for at least 1 year (12 months). But some women breastfeed longer.</p><p>For the first 4 to 6 months of life, breast milk is the only food babies need. Most babies start eating and drinking other foods (in addition to breast milk) when they are 4 to 6 months old. These foods include infant cereal and mashed up vegetables, fruits, and meats. Babies should not drink juice or cow's milk until they are 1 year old.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713010\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I wean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women choose to stop breastfeeding at different times and for different reasons. Most of the time, the mother chooses when to wean. But sometimes, weaning happens because a baby no longer wants to breastfeed.</p><p>Some babies wean quickly. Other babies can take months to wean.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713017\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I wean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When you decide to wean, do not stop breastfeeding all at once. Instead, try to reduce your breastfeeding slowly. To do this, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drop 1 breastfeeding session every 2 to 5 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shorten each breastfeeding session</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase the time between breastfeeding sessions</p><p/><p>Some women start to wean by stopping the daytime feedings first. They might still breastfeed at night or before bedtime. The night or bedtime feedings are usually the last feedings to be stopped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713024\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I give my baby a bottle or cup when I wean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can give your baby a bottle or a cup. Most babies younger than 6 months old are weaned to a bottle. Most babies older than 1 year are weaned to a cup. Babies between 6 months old and 1 year old can be weaned to a bottle or a cup.</p><p>To help your baby's first bottle or cup feedings go smoothly, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have someone else give your baby the bottle or cup</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give the bottle or cup before your baby gets too hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put breast milk in the bottle or cup</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a cup with 2 handles and a snap-on lid (if you use a cup)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713031\"><span class=\"h1\">What breast problems can happen with weaning?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different breast problems can happen with weaning. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Engorgement, which is when the breasts become too full of milk &ndash; This can cause the breasts to be swollen, hard, warm, and painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blocked milk duct &ndash; This can cause a red and painful breast lump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70540 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast infection &ndash; This can cause a fever and a hard, red, and swollen area of the breast.</p><p/><p>These problems are especially likely to happen if you stop breastfeeding all at once. If you need to wean all at once, there are things that you can do to prevent these problems. For example, you can use a breast pump or your hand to release some milk from your breasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73810 \">figure 1</a>). You can do this a few times a day for a few days until your breasts stop hurting.</p><p>Breast problems from weaning are treated in different ways, depending on the problem. If you have any of the above symptoms or problems, let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713038\"><span class=\"h1\">How might my breasts change after weaning?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women find that their breasts feel emptier and get smaller after weaning. Some women have stretch marks on their breasts. But stretch marks usually fade over time.</p><p>After you stop breastfeeding, your breasts will stop making milk. But it can be normal to still have some milk in your breasts for months or years after weaning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713045\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I feel sad or guilty when I wean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is normal for women to feel sad or guilty when they wean. Weaning can also be hard for babies. Your baby might need extra love during this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713052\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have questions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have any questions about breastfeeding or weaning, ask your doctor or nurse. Some women also find it helpful to work with a breastfeeding expert, called a &quot;lactation consultant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29713194\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-solid-foods-during-infancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Starting solid foods during infancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
