It has been used successfully to treat a variety of malignancies, predominantly germ cell tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma. The major limitation of bleomycin therapy is the potential for life-threatening interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (also called fibrosing alveolitis) in up to 10 percent of patients receiving the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].

Potential drug interactions that may modify the course of bleomycin-induced lung injury and the therapeutic options available for management will also be discussed. A general approach to immunocompromised patients with respiratory symptoms and the evaluation of interstitial lung disease in patients receiving chemotherapy are presented separately.

Bleomycin binds to DNA by intercalation of the bithiazole moiety between base pairs of DNA and by electrostatic interactions of the terminal amines. The reduction of molecular oxygen by ferrous ions chelated by bleomycin leads to hydrogen subtraction from the C3 and C4 carbons of deoxyribose, resulting in cleavage of the C3-C4 bond and liberation of a base with a DNA strand break [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Depletion of iron with chelators also reduces the toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> both in vitro and in vivo, probably secondary to decreased production of free radicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bleomycin</a> hydrolase, an enzyme that degrades bleomycin, is active in all tissues with the exception of the skin and the lung, which may account for the specific toxicity of the drug to these organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/2,6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,11</a>]. Studies investigating the varying susceptibility of mouse strains to bleomycin reveal that a bleomycin-resistant strain <span class=\"nowrap\">(BALB/c)</span> has much greater bleomycin hydrolase activity compared to a bleomycin-sensitive strain.

Nude (athymic) mice are resistant to bleomycin-induced lung injury, suggesting that the inflammatory process is important to the pathogenesis of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, SCID mice are not resistant, suggesting that T lymphocytes do not play a profibrotic role in the murine model of bleomycin-induced fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The influence of genetic factors in the development of bleomycin-induced lung injury is suggested by the large variation in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> sensitivity among treated patients, and by data showing that the development of bleomycin-induced lung injury in rodents is strain-specific.

In at least one report, long-term pulmonary toxicity (unspecified) persisted in 8 percent of patients treated with three courses of BEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. With few exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/31,32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,36</a>], most of these reports defined bleomycin pulmonary toxicity according to symptoms and clinical findings of pneumonitis and respiratory failure, and not by systematic assessment for asymptomatic pulmonary toxicity using pulmonary function tests (PFTs). (See <a href=\"#H2806420295\" class=\"local\">'Screening asymptomatic patients for lung toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p>However, more recent data suggest that the overall risk of clinically-apparent and fatal bleomycin-induced lung injury may be lower, and that pulmonary toxicity is reversible and without long-term sequelae in most cases. The best data come from a registry-based series of 565 consecutive patients derived from the Danish Testicular Cancer database, who were treated with BEP for a germ cell tumor and underwent systematic and close monitoring of PFTs before, during, and for five years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The maximum cumulative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> was limited to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Overall, more than 50 percent of the patients had a history of smoking. Approximately 9 percent discontinued bleomycin because of a significant (&ge;25 percent) decline in hemoglobin-corrected diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) during treatment. Other pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) were unchanged after BEP therapy. Excluding pulmonary embolism, 12 patients (2.1 percent) developed nonfatal acute pulmonary toxicity that was potentially attributable to bleomycin, and only one of the 15 deaths during treatment was attributed to bleomycin pneumonitis (0.17 percent). </p><p>At five years of follow-up of the Danish Testicular Cancer database, only a minority of BEP-treated patients, including those who discontinued <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> due to a decrease in DLCO, suffered long-term restrictive disease (4.1%; 95% CI 1.8-6.3%) or obstructive lung disease (2.7%; 95% CI 0.8-4.6%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. After a median follow-up of 16.1 years, the 15-year cumulative risk for pulmonary disease in treated patients was low, and comparable to that of a contemporaneously treated group of 2548 patients with stage I germ cell tumors who received no chemotherapy and were observed in a surveillance program (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107640 \">table 1</a>). Although pulmonary function returned to normal in the majority of patients over time, patients who underwent pulmonary surgery or suffered pulmonary embolism during or before treatment had continuously decreased pulmonary function as did smokers. Importantly, there were no differences in long-term outcome among patients who received all of the doses of bleomycin (median 142 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> versus those whose doses were attenuated because of changes in the DLCO (median dose 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>. &#160;</p><p>These data suggest that identification of patients who have asymptomatic decreases in DLCO, and early discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> in such individuals leads to low rates of long-term bleomycin-induced pulmonary disease without compromising oncologic outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2806420295\" class=\"local\">'Screening asymptomatic patients for lung toxicity'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (PMNSGCTs) who require postchemotherapy thoracic surgery to remove residual disease may be more susceptible to postoperative respiratory complications related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Among 221 patients with PMNSGCT who underwent postchemotherapy mediastinal or lung surgery at a single institution, acute respiratory failure or pneumonia developed in 22 of the 166 patients who had received BEP (13 percent) and none of the 55 who had received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (VIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bleomycin-induced-lung-injury/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, similar findings have not been observed at other centers and the authors remain comfortable treating such patients with BEP in the absence of other risk factors for bleomycin pulmonary toxicity and with serial PFTs to monitor DLCO and vital capacity. To minimize postoperative risks in all patients previously treated with BEP including those with PMNSGCT, limitation of supplemental oxygen and avoidance of excess intravenous fluid support is recommended.

Additional problems with interpretation of a baseline DLCO include reductions in inspiratory capacity due to airway compression by mediastinal masses and the inability to put forth maximal inspiratory effort due to chest pain.

(See <a href=\"#H2806420295\" class=\"local\">'Screening asymptomatic patients for lung toxicity'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of clinical manifestations usually occurs subacutely between one and six months after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> treatment, but may occur during therapy or more than six months following the administration of bleomycin. Symptoms and signs of bleomycin-induced lung toxicity include nonproductive cough, dyspnea, pleuritic or substernal chest pain, fever, tachypnea, crackles, lung restriction, and hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"#H2960899774\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic pattern of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis includes bibasilar subpleural opacities with volume loss and blunting of the costophrenic angles; however, fine nodular densities may also be seen. Honeycombing may develop, as the fibrosis progresses. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend permanently discontinuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> therapy in most patients with documented or strongly suspected bleomycin-induced lung injury, including an asymptomatic decrease in the DLCO of 25 percent or more (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). While successful reinitiation of bleomycin in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis related to bleomycin has been described, we do not reintroduce bleomycin in these patients unless the goal of therapy is cure and there is no equally effective alternative antineoplastic agent for the patient's disease. (See <a href=\"#H599304681\" class=\"local\">'Permanent discontinuation of bleomycin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptomatic bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity and evidence of impairment on pulmonary function tests, we recommend administration of systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The usual initial dose is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 0.75 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (ideal body weight) up to 100 mg per day. After four to six weeks, this dose is gradually tapered. For patients with mild toxicity (eg, asymptomatic, no need for supplemental oxygen, decrease in DLCO as the only manifestation, minimal to no radiographic abnormalities), we would stop the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> and watch for worsening of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DLCO before initiating glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H1740138258\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids for lung toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with a clinical presentation of chronic pulmonary fibrosis (late, indolent onset and CT scan consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia), we suggest not administering systemic glucocorticoids based on the lack of benefit in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the evidence is anecdotal as to whether administration of high inspired fractions of oxygen may provoke or exacerbate pulmonary toxicity several years after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, we suggest carefully titrating any supplemental oxygen to provide only enough oxygen to maintain the oxygen saturation at 89 to 92 percent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3448649854\" class=\"local\">'Supplemental oxygen and future perioperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For bleomycin-exposed patients who undergo subsequent surgery, intravenous fluids are administered sparingly to avoid volume overload and perioperative pulmonary edema.
