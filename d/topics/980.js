However, adjunctive pharmacotherapy may be indicated for acutely ill patients who do not gain weight despite first line treatment with nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy. In addition, adjunctive pharmacotherapy may possibly help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients who do not respond to first line treatment. Distorted thinking about body image and food usually does not respond to pharmacotherapy, nor do maintenance medications help delay or prevent subsequent episodes of anorexia nervosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5094786\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with anorexia nervosa, standard treatment consists of nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy, which are supported by far more evidence than pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Medications are used only for patients who do not respond to initial, standard treatment; if pharmacotherapy is added to the treatment regimen, the focus of treatment needs to remain upon nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy.</p><p>Many patients with anorexia nervosa refuse pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], particularly medications with side effects that include weight gain and the metabolic syndrome. This refusal stems from symptoms of anorexia nervosa that include lack of recognition of the seriousness of the disorder and ambivalence about weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Negotiation and motivational interviewing (motivating the patient to gain weight by eliciting both the patient&rsquo;s reasons to do so and the patient&rsquo;s ambivalence about change) may help overcome this resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Parents of adolescents may also refuse consent due to general concerns about drug safety, which may be allayed with education. </p><p>For patients with anorexia nervosa who consent to medications, clinicians should initially prescribe a small dose because low weight patients are at increased risk for side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/1,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,9</a>]. In addition, depletion of body protein increases the percentage of unbound (free) drug in serum and depletion of body fat decreases the volume of distribution. Pharmacokinetic problems such as poor drug absorption or toxicity can occur because of starvation, vomiting, dehydration, or excess hydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The antidepressant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> should be avoided because it is associated with a higher incidence of seizures in patients with eating disorders, particularly patients who binge-eat and purge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should consider the medical complications of anorexia nervosa when selecting a medication. As an example, starvation can cause bradycardia, hypotension, QT dispersion, diminished heart rate variability, and the long QT syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, drugs that prolong cardiac conduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a>), such as antipsychotics and antidepressants, should be used cautiously in malnourished patients. Tricyclic antidepressants should not be used because of their potential cardiotoxicity. The medical complications of anorexia nervosa are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: Medical complications and their management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3028991\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few randomized trials suggest that antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>) may be useful for restoring weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, many other psychotropic drugs have demonstrated little or no benefit for weight gain and other therapeutic targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/1-4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,14,15</a>].</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the general lack of demonstrated efficacy of pharmacotherapy in anorexia nervosa. Starvation and alterations in neurotransmitter function may prevent response to medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, restrictive eating behavior may become so neurobiologically entrenched that it is impervious to medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Further, relatively few rigorous trials have been conducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>], and many patients refuse to participate in randomized pharmacotherapy trials or drop-out after enrollment; these problems make it difficult to interpret the results and to demonstrate a beneficial effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, a one-year randomized trial with 122 patients found that 55 percent dropped out, and much of the attrition occurred within the first five weeks. </p><p>Most randomized trials of pharmacotherapy have been conducted within multimodal programs that specialize in eating disorders and are based at academically-affiliated hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For anorexia nervosa patients who do not have access to specialized treatment, pharmacotherapy may conceivably provide greater benefits than those observed in the trials.</p><p>Medication combinations have not been studied for any specific indication (eg, mood disorders) in patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and should generally be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3028999\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of treatment in medically stable patients with anorexia nervosa is weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3030016\"><span class=\"h3\">Antipsychotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of adjunctive antipsychotics for restoring weight in patients with anorexia nervosa appears to be modest at best, based upon meta-analyses that aggregated data for different drugs.

However, patients not gaining weight despite standard treatment are candidates for adjunctive pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment#H251810\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Anorexia nervosa'</a> and <a href=\"#H5094779\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low weight patients treated with pharmacotherapy are at increased risk for side effects and should initially receive a small dose. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a> should not be used because it is associated with a higher incidence of seizures in patients with eating disorders. Medical complications of anorexia nervosa should also be considered. As an example, drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a>) that impact cardiac function, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants (especially tricyclic agents), should be used cautiously in malnourished patients. (See <a href=\"#H5094786\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: Medical complications and their management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For acutely ill patients not gaining weight with nutritional rehabilitation plus psychotherapy, we suggest adjunctive treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day, rather than other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1214159\" class=\"local\">'Olanzapine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H240421\" class=\"local\">'Other medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychopathology about body image and food generally does not respond to pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H3029007\" class=\"local\">'Distorted thoughts about body image and food'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of choice for patients who have recovered from an episode of anorexia nervosa is maintenance psychotherapy; adjunctive pharmacotherapy is not beneficial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment#H251954\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Psychotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"#H3029015\" class=\"local\">'Relapse prevention'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild to moderate comorbid depressive or anxiety disorders often resolve with standard treatment consisting of nutritional rehabilitation plus psychotherapy. For severe comorbid disorders that do not respond to standard treatment, it is reasonable to initially try a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Severe depression that is unresponsive to an SSRI may perhaps respond to a second-generation antipsychotic. (See <a href=\"#H3029030\" class=\"local\">'Comorbid psychopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">American Psychiatric Association.
