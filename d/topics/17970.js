PLL can be of B or T cell lineage:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell PLL (T-PLL) is a rare T cell neoplasm composed of lymphoid cells, typically with involvement of the peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. The name &quot;prolymphocyte&quot; is a misnomer, as the tumor cells in this disease are of post-thymic T cell origin. This class of neoplasms includes many cases previously classified as T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a category no longer included in the current World Health Organization classification.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B cell PLL (B-PLL) is a very rare B cell neoplasm comprised of so-called prolymphocytes, typically with involvement of the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. The name &quot;prolymphocyte&quot; in this case is also a misnomer, as the tumor cells in this disease are mature activated B cells. By definition, these prolymphocytes comprise more than 55 percent of the cells in the blood and bone marrow.</p><p/><p>This topic will review the management of T-PLL. The diagnosis of T-PLL and the diagnosis and management of B-PLL are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=b-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;B cell prolymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435582\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with T-PLL require treatment at the time of diagnosis. Active treatment is typically reserved for patients with symptomatic disease. This is principally because: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the possible exception of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), T-PLL cannot be cured by current treatment options.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-PLL is a heterogenous disease. While T-PLL is typically more aggressive than B-PLL, up to 30 percent of patients with T-PLL present with initially stable or slowly progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Among newly diagnosed patients with asymptomatic T-PLL, we suggest observation rather than immediate treatment. Therapy is indicated for patients with the following disease-related complications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness, night sweats, weight loss, symptomatic lymphadenopathy, or fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin infiltration, pleural effusion, or central nervous system involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive disease, as demonstrated by increasing lymphocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. In contrast, transient localized lymphadenopathy, occurring in response to localized infections, is not necessarily an indication for treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435910\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC PLL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, immediate treatment is recommended in patients with symptomatic disease. Otherwise, a period of observation is suggested. It is very important to monitor these patients closely because, unlike patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, patients with T-PLL inevitably progress, sometimes with a rapid course that may be fatal. (See <a href=\"#H435582\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>During the observation period, we perform blood counts at monthly intervals along with a clinical examination. Of particular importance is the rate of increase in blood lymphocyte count and any evidence indicating emergence of progressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic disease. A blood lymphocyte doubling time less than 8.5 months has been associated with a worse prognosis and may be considered evidence of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some clinicians choose to offer treatment in this setting, although it is our preference not to treat based on the doubling time alone. In addition to the doubling time, the initial level of blood lymphocyte count should be considered. For example, a doubling of the lymphocyte count from 10,000 to 20,000 per microliter in less than eight months in a patient who is free of symptoms does not have the same weight in deciding to initiate therapy as a rapid doubling of the lymphocyte count from 75,000 to 150,000 per microliter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3804053\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the initiation of active therapy for patients with symptomatic disease, patients with T-PLL should undergo a pretreatment evaluation to determine the extent of disease, patient performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785%7EHEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 graphicRef72901 \">table 1A-B</a>), and assessment of comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. </p><p>In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with T-PLL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serologic and polymerase chain reaction testing for human T-lymphotropic viruses, type 1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients planning to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> should undergo serology testing for cytomegalovirus (IgM and IgG), herpes simplex virus (IgM and IgG), hepatitis B (HBsAg and anti-HBc), and hepatitis C (anti-HCV). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is recommended for all patients. This sample should be sent for pathologic review, immunophenotyping, cytochemistry, and conventional cytogenetics. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and women with childbearing potential should receive counseling about the potential effect of treatment on their fertility and options for fertility-preserving measures. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> or purine analogs is unlikely to result in infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest x-ray should be obtained to evaluate for hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. We also obtain a computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate the bulk of disease and screen for unusual sites of involvement (eg, liver involvement).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3804676\"><span class=\"h1\">REMISSION INDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment of patients symptomatic of T-PLL consists of chemotherapy administered with the goal of attaining a complete remission (CR). T-PLL is primarily treated with alemtuzumab-based chemotherapy. Once a CR is attained, post-remission therapy (ie, allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]) is given with the goal of eradicating tumor cells that cannot be detected using standard techniques (ie, minimal residual disease). (See <a href=\"#H153900505\" class=\"local\">'Post-remission therapy'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Patients with symptomatic T-PLL progress quickly without treatment and have a median overall survival measured in months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The best treatment for these patients is unclear, and patients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials whenever possible. Data regarding the treatment of T-PLL primarily come from retrospective analyses and small prospective trials. There have been no randomized trials in this patient population. Conventional alkylator or anthracycline-based therapies are largely ineffective. Alemtuzumab-based chemotherapy is the preferred initial treatment for most patients with T-PLL. The purine analog <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a> is added for patients who fail to attain a CR with single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>. The published experience with other agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelarabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a>) as single agents is limited to small series and case reports, largely in relapsed disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>Our approach is consistent with the guidelines for the management of mature T cell and NK cell neoplasms developed by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For most patients with T-PLL, we recommend initial treatment with alemtuzumab-based chemotherapy, rather than other chemotherapy combinations. For eligible patients who achieve a CR, we suggest consolidation with an autologous or allogeneic HCT rather than observation. With this approach, a majority of patients will achieve a CR and a minority achieves long-term disease-free survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69897035\"><span class=\"h2\">Alemtuzumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anti-CD52 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> is the initial treatment of choice for most patients with T-PLL, although it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. The manufacturer of alemtuzumab withdrew this product from the US market on September 4, 2012. These actions were not related to safety concerns, but instead were in order to market this drug under a different name for other conditions. Alemtuzumab remains accessible through a distribution program for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-PLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The majority of cases of T-PLL strongly express the CD52 antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Very rarely, CD52 has been downregulated in relapsed cases, and this has been associated with a lack of response. Thus, tumor expression of CD52 should be confirmed before starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> therapy.</p><p>Retrospective and prospective studies of alemtuzumab-based chemotherapy have reported response rates ranging from 80 to 100 percent and 50 to 76 percent in patients with previously untreated and previously treated T-PLL, respectively. CRs are seen in 40 to 100 percent of patients. In comparison, the overall response rate with purine analogs is less than 50 percent, with few CRs and remission durations of less than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13-15</a>]. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> has been considered the treatment of choice for T-PLL, responses are not durable, and additional strategies (eg, autologous or allogeneic HCT) should be considered for the consolidation of eligible patients.</p><p>The following is a selection of the largest studies that have evaluated single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> in T-PLL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective series of 76 patients, 72 of whom had failed at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen, the overall response rate (ORR) was 51 percent (40 percent complete) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The median progression-free and overall survival times were 4.5 and 7.5 months, respectively. Median overall survival was 15 months for patients achieving CR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> in 39 patients with previously treated T-PLL reported an ORR of 76 percent (60 percent complete) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The median progression-free and overall survival rates were 7 and 10 months, respectively. One patient remained in CR 10 years after allogeneic transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 46 therapy-na&iuml;ve patients with T-PLL, aged 36 to 85 years, were treated with single agent intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> achieving an ORR of 92 percent with an 81 percent CR rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Two-thirds of patients were progression-free at a year and a third remained alive at four years. An additional nine patients who received alemtuzumab by the subcutaneous route had a markedly inferior response rate (33 percent) and this route of administration is therefore not recommended.</p><p/><p>Small prospective studies have also evaluated the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> in combination with other agents. As an example, in a multicenter phase II trial of 25 patients with T-PLL treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (FMC) followed by alemtuzumab reported that the ORR increased from 68 to 92 percent after the administration of alemtuzumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Median progression-free and overall survivals were 11.9 and 17.1 months, respectively. The combination of alemtuzumab plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a> is discussed in the following section. (See <a href=\"#H153900763\" class=\"local\">'Pentostatin'</a> below.)</p><p>The studies that have evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> in T-PLL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia have used different administration schedules and the ideal schedule is unknown. Unlike in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, intravenous alemtuzumab appears to be more effective than subcutaneous alemtuzumab in T-PLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Infusion reactions are common with the first dose of alemtuzumab, so it is common to premedicate with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> and gradually increase the administered dose over a few days as tolerated until reaching the standard dose. We administer alemtuzumab 3 mg intravenously on day 1; 10 mg on day 2; and 30 mg on day 3, followed by 30 mg doses every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday beginning the following week until maximum response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The prevention and management of infusion reactions is discussed separately. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alemtuzumab</a> increases the vulnerability of patients to opportunistic infections, including fatal bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infection, as well as reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV), indicating that appropriate antibacterial and antiviral prophylaxis must be instituted when this agent is employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/15,21-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21-29</a>]. The most commonly reported prophylaxis regimens include antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> DS or cotrimoxazole) together with antiviral agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a>) during therapy and until CD4+ cell counts are <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;200/microL,</span> and for a minimum of two months after last treatment. CMV viremia should be measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) weekly during treatment. The approach to CMV management varies by center. Some use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> prophylaxis if viremia is present, while others use it only if the viral load is rising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Our typical practice is to monitor patients as above. If a patient converts from CMV-negative to CMV-positive status or if a patient previously positive for CMV has an increase in viral load, we suspend therapy with alemtuzumab and begin treatment of CMV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies#H447874693\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency induced by biologic therapies&quot;, section on 'Alemtuzumab'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153900763\"><span class=\"h2\">Pentostatin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pentostatin</a> is the purine analog that has demonstrated the greatest activity in T-PLL. Pentostatin has been evaluated in retrospective and small prospective trials both as a single agent and in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>. Although the two drugs have not been directly compared in a randomized trial, single agent pentostatin appears to have a lower response rate than single agent alemtuzumab. For patients who fail to attain a CR with single agent alemtuzumab, we suggest the addition of pentostatin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a> reported data from 55 patients with previously treated or previously untreated T-PLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The ORR was 45 percent (9 percent complete) and did not vary depending upon prior therapy. Responses were seen after three to four injections. The median progression-free and overall survivals were six and nine months, respectively. Toxicities included mild to moderate nausea in approximately one-third of patients. Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia were seen in 35, 20, and 18 percent of patients, respectively. Infections were seen in approximately one-quarter of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phase II study evaluated the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a> in 24 patients with T cell leukemia or lymphoma, 13 with T-PLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The ORR in this subgroup was 69 percent (62 percent complete). For patients with T-PLL, the median overall and progression-free survivals were 10.2 and 7.8 months, respectively. Prophylactic antimicrobials with antiviral agents, antifungal agents, and anti-<em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (previously <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em>) agents were mandatory during treatment and for a minimum of two months after the completion of treatment. Despite this, the most common toxicities were infection (75 percent), thrombocytopenia (37 percent), neutropenia (45 percent), and anemia (8 percent). CMV reactivation was seen in 38 percent of patients.</p><p/><p>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentostatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentostatin</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> increases toxicity, but it is unclear whether it increases the response rate since there have been no randomized trials comparing combination therapy with single-agent therapy. As such, we reserve the use of pentostatin for those patients who fail to attain a CR after treatment with single agent alemtuzumab. For such patients, we continue the alemtuzumab therapy three times a week and add pentostatin 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly. Patients who attain a CR with this approach can proceed to post-remission therapy. Those who do not attain a CR should be referred for clinical trials.

The history should include questions regarding constitutional symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fevers, and night sweats. The physical examination should pay particular attention to the evaluation for skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. A lymph node biopsy should be obtained if transformation into an aggressive lymphoma is suspected. While patients with T-PLL do not undergo Richter transformation, they can develop an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) driven lymphoma (similar to post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease) after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>.

Progressive disease is defined by a &ge;50 percent increase in detectable disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153900505\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-REMISSION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 80 percent of patients with T-PLL who undergo initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> will attain a complete remission (CR). However, without additional cytotoxic therapy, virtually all patients with T-PLL will relapse within one to two years. In contrast, patients who attain a CR and proceed with an allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may expect two- and five-year survival rates as high as 60 and 30 percent, respectively. For eligible patients who achieve a CR, we suggest consolidation with HCT rather than observation. Allogeneic and autologous HCT appear to produce similar survival rates, but differ in treatment-related mortality (TRM) and relapse rates. In general, we prefer allogeneic HCT for younger adults with a good performance status. The main challenges that remain are the relatively high TRM and relapse incidence, with less than half of transplanted patients in sustained remissions. Relapses usually occur early, within the first two years, although we have rarely seen a late relapse (more than five years). An autologous HCT may be considered for patients who achieve a CR but are not candidates for an allogeneic HCT, because of age, fitness, or lack of a suitable donor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter retrospective study evaluated the outcomes of patients with T-PLL who underwent either autologous (16 patients) or allogeneic (23 patients) HCT following the attainment of a good partial response (three patients) or CR with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, and compared these patients with 26 patients with T-PLL who achieved a CR and survived at least six months after alemtuzumab treatment but did not proceed with HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/19,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,32</a>]. When compared with allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT had a lower TRM rate (6 versus 30 percent), but higher relapse rate (87 versus 39 percent) resulting in a median overall survival of 49 months for autologous versus 33 months for allogeneic HCT. When compared with the patients who did not receive HCT, those who received autologous or allogeneic HCT appeared to have a longer median overall survival (37 versus 20 months). Five-year overall survival for the autologous, allogeneic, and non-HCT groups was 37, 28, and 13 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another retrospective analysis evaluated 47 patients with PLL (21 with T-PLL) who underwent allogeneic HCT in CR (36 percent), partial remission (18 percent), or with refractory disease (46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. With a median follow-up of 13 months, the cumulative incidence of TRM at one year was 28 percent and the one-year incidence of relapse or progression was 39 percent. The median progression-free survival for the patients with T-PLL was 5.1 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry had 41 patients with T-PLL who had received an allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Survival at three years was only 21 percent with TRM and relapse rates of 41 percent. Almost half of the patients had refractory disease at the time of transplant, which adversely affected outcome and supports the argument for transplanting patients while they are in good remission. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another registry-based retrospective study included 27 patients with T-PLL who underwent allogeneic HCT in CR (14 patients), partial remission (10 patients), or in the setting of refractory disease (3 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. With median follow-up of 33 months, 10 patients remain in continuous CR. Estimated rates of overall survival, progression-free survival, and TRM at three years were 36, 26, and 31 percent, respectively. Approximately half (47 percent) relapsed with a median time to relapse of 11.7 months and all relapses occurring within the first two years.</p><p/><p>As with all reports of new treatments, attention must be given to the possibility that patients receiving these treatments represent only a small, unrepresentative subset of patients with T-PLL. High intensity chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT in T-PLL has been limited by donor availability and the advanced age of most patients with this disorder. Following improvements in technique and supportive care and the introduction of reduced intensity conditioning regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], the upper age limit for allogeneic HCT has been increased to 70 years. In addition, it seems likely that results with matched unrelated donor transplants are similar to those seen with matched sibling transplants, further extending the applicability of allogeneic HCT in T-PLL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Unrelated donors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H89394696\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity preparative regimens'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3804573\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the completion of therapy, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. The frequency and extent of these visits depend upon the comfort of both the patient and physician and the type of post-remission therapy administered. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the hematopoietic cell transplant recipient in the immediate post-transplant period&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Relapsed disease usually presents with evidence of circulating tumor cells in the blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin changes. It is recommended that relapsed disease suggested by changes on imaging or physical examination be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy is recommended to document relapsed disease before proceeding to salvage therapy.</p><p>Patients with T-PLL treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematopoietic cell transplantation are immunocompromised and are therefore at risk for potentially lethal opportunistic infections with organisms such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (previously <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em>) and cytomegalovirus. While prophylaxis for such infections is generally given, clinicians need to consider these organisms when patients become unwell. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diagnostic-tests-for-cytomegalovirus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diagnostic tests for cytomegalovirus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69897253\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RELAPSED PLL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little information on the treatment of recurrent or refractory T-PLL and patients should be referred for enrollment in clinical trials.</p><p>Repeat treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> may have activity in patients with T-PLL. A prospective study of alemtuzumab in 38 patients with relapsed or refractory T-PLL reported a second response in 5 of 12 patients treated with alemtuzumab at relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, some cases of T-PLL lose CD52 expression at the time of relapse resulting in resistance to alemtuzumab. As such, CD52 expression should be reassessed by immunophenotype prior to retreatment with alemtuzumab. There is some evidence that epigenetic therapies (eg, histone deacetylase inhibitors), with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a>, may be able to modify CD52 and other molecules and thus overcome treatment resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nelarabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> deliver response rates in the order of 30 to 50 percent<strong>, </strong>but response duration of only a few months. In a report of 15 patients with T-PLL treated with bendamustine, seven of whom had failed front-line therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, the overall response rate was 53 percent (20 percent complete remission) with a median progression-free survival of five months and overall survival of 8.7 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Clinical outcomes were independent of prior exposure to alemtuzumab or other features. </p><p>New approaches will exploit the growing evidence for specific genetic abnormalities in T-PLL, which can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors. As an example, there is interest in examining the use of novel therapies targeting the JAK-STAT pathway, which is dysregulated in T-PLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. In vitro drug sensitivity assays have highlighted a number of additional novel therapeutics, such as HDAC- and bcl-2-inhibitors which have activity in T-PLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. These data need to be formally confirmed in the clinical setting, but there is anecdotal evidence from case reports and small studies that these drugs may be important for future therapy of this rare and generally fatal disease.</p><p>The fact that there are some long-term survivors (&gt;10 years) following reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) suggests that this approach has curative potential, likely related to a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Allografted patients do still have a risk of relapse, and in our experience outcome after such relapse has been very poor. There is no clarity regarding the best relapse treatment in this setting or the benefit of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). There remains uncertainty about the optimal strategy for allogeneic HCT, which would be best addressed by conducting prospective clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69897308\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often there is no better therapy to offer a patient than enrollment onto a well-designed, scientifically valid, peer-reviewed clinical trial.
