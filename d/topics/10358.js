Bleeding is especially concerning with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) because antidotes or specific reversal agents for some of the DOACs are lacking. Additionally, routine coagulation tests cannot be used to determine the degree of anticoagulation, making it more challenging to determine when the anticoagulant effect has resolved.</p><p>This topic discusses our approach to managing bleeding in patients receiving DOACs. Specific indications for these agents, details of administration and monitoring, and perioperative management of these agents are presented separately.

We use the following terminology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)</strong> &ndash; DOACs are oral medications that inhibit a specific enzyme in the coagulation cascade. A consensus document regarding terminology for these agents has been published; although no single term emerged as the obviously best term, DOAC was preferred by the most experts surveyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These medications are also called target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs), oral direct inhibitors (ODIs), or referred to by their individual names or the enzyme they inhibit. We prefer to avoid the terms &quot;novel oral anticoagulant&quot; and &quot;new(er) oral anticoagulant&quot; (NOAC) because over time each agent ceases to be novel or new. Some clinicians refer to this group of agents as &quot;<strong>n</strong>on-vitamin K antagonist <strong>o</strong>ral <strong>a</strong>nti<strong>c</strong>oagulants&quot;, to retain the NOAC acronym. Of concern are anecdotal reports of &quot;NOAC&quot; being interpreted as &quot;no anticoagulant,&quot; leading to failure to provide anticoagulant medications to patients at high risk of thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Available agents include those that directly inhibit thrombin (factor IIa) or factor Xa. The positions of these enzymes in the coagulation cascade are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94856 \">figure 1</a>) and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dabigatran</a> &ndash; Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is the only oral direct thrombin inhibitor available for clinical use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a>; these agents are discussed separately.

Of note, the generic names for these agents include &quot;<strong>Xa-</strong>ban&quot; (eg, rivaro<strong>xaban</strong>, api<strong>xaban</strong>, edo<strong>xaban</strong>, betri<strong>xaban</strong>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other anticoagulants also inhibit factors Xa and thrombin, but their effects are indirect. The effects of heparins (which inhibit factor Xa and to a lesser extent thrombin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> (which inhibits factor Xa) are mediated through antithrombin (AT). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> reduces the synthesis of functional factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X; its anticoagulant effect is due to reduced ability to generate active thrombin, rather than an inhibition of activated enzymes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Degree of bleeding</strong> &ndash; Bleeding is a spectrum, and bleeding that is initially minor can sometimes become more significant or even life-threatening. Thus, clinical judgment is required in all cases of bleeding to determine the risk to the patient and the appropriate degree of concern regarding whether the bleeding is resolving or worsening. Importantly, the initial presentation of bleeding may be misleading; what appears to be massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding may in retrospect be less serious than initially suspected, while many forms of &quot;occult&quot; bleeding may present innocuously but ultimately lead to major morbidity or death (for example, retroperitoneal bleeding).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We define <span class=\"nowrap\">serious/major</span> bleeding as bleeding that is potentially associated with significant blood loss requiring blood transfusion or bleeding into a critical closed space (eg, intracranial bleeding, compartment syndrome). Major bleeding may also include bleeding requiring an intervention for management (eg, surgery, interventional radiology procedures, endoscopic treatments). Major bleeding has a significant risk of immediate morbidity, regardless of the cause. Some major bleeding may be life-threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Minor, but still clinically significant, bleeding includes bleeding requiring a healthcare assessment or less invasive treatment, such as severe menorrhagia, ecchymosis, or epistaxis. All types of bleeding are important to the patient; however, very minor bleeding usually will not require interruption of anticoagulant therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3105375\"><span class=\"h1\">BLEEDING RISKS FROM DOACs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All anticoagulants increase bleeding risk. As with other anticoagulants, DOACs are associated with a low overall risk of major bleeding. However, as with any anticoagulant, life-threatening bleeding can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3208337\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes of DOAC-associated bleeding appear favorable compared with vitamin K antagonists. This was demonstrated in a 2015 meta-analysis that included 13 randomized trials (over 100,000 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The case-fatality rate for major bleeding was 7.6 percent in patients taking a DOAC, compared with 11 percent for patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. There were reductions in the relative risk of fatal bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.53; 95% CI 0.43-0.64), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82-0.94), and all-cause mortality (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.87-0.96). The reduced case-fatality rate in patients with major DOAC-associated bleeding is likely largely attributable to the reduced rate and size of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p><p>In a 2018 retrospective review of over 140,000 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), approximately three-fourths of whom had atrial fibrillation, those who were taking a DOAC had a lower mortality than those who were taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.75; 95% CI 0.69-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other outcomes such as ability to ambulate, discharge home, and modified Rankin score also favored DOACs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>VTE</strong> &ndash; A 2014 meta-analysis of randomized trials in patients with VTE included 10 trials (almost 38,000 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In six trials that compared VTE treatment using a DOAC or a vitamin K antagonist, fatal bleeding was less frequent in DOAC-treated compared with vitamin K antagonist-treated patients (0.09 versus 0.18 percent; RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.26-1.01). In three trials of secondary VTE prevention, all-cause mortality was lower with DOAC administration compared with placebo (0.41 versus 0.86 percent; RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.18-0.79).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> &ndash; A 2013 review of randomized trials that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in patients with atrial fibrillation included five trials (over 27,000 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The 30-day mortality was lower with dabigatran than warfarin (9.1 versus 13.0; adjusted pooled OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-1.00). Dabigatran-treated patients also had shorter average stays in the intensive care unit compared with warfarin-treated patients (1.6 versus 2.6 nights).</p><p/><p>Post-marketing surveillance also has not shown an increased risk of bleeding fatalities with the DOAC agents compared with vitamin K antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A retrospective review involving 2002 individuals with anticoagulant-associated bleeding found a lower initial fatality rate in the DOAC-treated individuals compared with those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (10 versus 15 percent; RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.49-0.89) and a trend towards decreased mortality at 30 days that did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2021266\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative bleeding risks with DOACs versus other anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, low molecular weight [LMW] heparin) have been evaluated in various clinical settings. Risks of bleeding from DOACs are generally lower or similar to vitamin K antagonists, with some exceptions (eg, higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients older than 65 years receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The overall risk of bleeding with DOACs versus vitamin K antagonists was reviewed in a meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials that included 102,607 patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Compared with vitamin K antagonists, DOACs were associated with lower risks of major bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.72; 95% CI 0.62-0.85), fatal bleeding (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.43-0.64), and intracranial bleeding (0.43; 95% CI 0.37-0.50); major gastrointestinal bleeding was not increased (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.75-1.99). The lower risk of fatal bleeding seen with DOACs is noteworthy because no antidote was available in the clinical trials. This lower risk of fatal bleeding even in the absence of a specific reversal agent highlights the importance of considering a &quot;supportive care&quot; approach when managing a patient with DOAC associated bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H2281578\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, however, clinicians weighing the risks and benefits of a specific anticoagulant must take into account individual patient factors and the specific anticoagulant under consideration; these individual factors may not be captured by meta-analyses that combine data from trials that used different agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> different doses. The following reports illustrate some general observations about bleeding risks in some patient populations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> &ndash; Data from randomized trials in patients with atrial fibrillation (RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE) suggest that the rates of major bleeding in patients receiving DOACs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, respectively) are on the order of 2 to 3 percent per year, and rates of hemorrhagic stroke are on the order of 0.1 to 0.5 percent per year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80932 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Compared with bleeding rates in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, rates of major bleeding are similar with DOACs, and rates of hemorrhagic stroke are less with DOACs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This lower bleeding risk compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> has been replicated in some, but not all, &quot;real world&quot; studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. However, the reduction in the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and death has been seen consistently, with a relative risk reduction for ICH on the order of 60 to 70 percent in most studies. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dabigatran</a> &ndash; A database review that included over 50,000 patients treated with dabigatran or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for atrial fibrillation found that use of dabigatran was associated with lower risks of bleeding than warfarin (gastrointestinal hemorrhage: 1.6 versus 3.5 per 100,000 patient days; intracranial hemorrhage: 0.8 versus 2.4 per 100,000 patient days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, this analysis was limited by the likely allocation of lower-risk patients to dabigatran and higher-risk patients to warfarin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Another database review that included 134,414 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for atrial fibrillation and adjusted for potentially confounding variables found rates of major bleeding with dabigatran and warfarin of 4.3 and 4.4 per 100 patient-years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Rates of ICH in this review for dabigatran and warfarin were 0.24 and 0.73 per 100 patient-years, and mortality rates were 3.3 and 3.8 per 100 person-years. A review of 341 patients in the Dresden registry found rates of major bleeding of 2.88 and 0.86 per 100 person-years at the dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily doses, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rivaroxaban</a> &ndash; A database review that included 27,467 patients treated with rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation reported 496 major bleeding events (incidence, 2.86 per 100 person-years) and 14 major bleeding deaths (0.08 per 100 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most of the major bleeds were gastrointestinal (89 percent, versus 8 percent ICH). Patients with major bleeding were slightly older and had higher rates of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no randomized trials comparing one DOAC with another, although observational studies may show differences in bleeding with different DOACs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We would not make any change in our clinical practice based on observational studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venous thromboembolism</strong> &ndash; Patients receiving DOACs for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have an overall annual risk of major bleeding of approximately 1 percent. A meta-analysis of five randomized trials that included 24,455 patients with VTE who were treated with a DOAC reported absolute annual risks for fatal bleeding, non-fatal ICH, and gastrointestinal bleeding of 0.06, 0.09, and 0.35 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk for major bleeding among DOAC-treated patients was lower than that for patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (RR of any major bleeding with a DOAC compared with warfarin: 0.50; 95% CI 0.41-0.88). An observational study performed in Dresden, which included 575 patients with VTE treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, reported 4.1 major bleeding episodes per 100 patient years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A randomized trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betrixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betrixaban</a> with prophylactic-dose low molecular weight (LMW) heparin in over 7500 acutely ill medical inpatients at high risk of VTE (the APEX trial) found a rate of major bleeding of 0.6 percent, which was comparable to LMW heparin (0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Older patients</strong> &ndash; Some studies have found age to be an independent risk factor for anticoagulant-associated bleeding (ie, they have found a higher risk of bleeding from anticoagulation in older compared with younger patients); others have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. High-quality data on the relative risk of bleeding in older versus younger patients receiving DOACs are not available. However, older patients receiving DOACs do not appear to have a greater risk of bleeding compared with older patients receiving other anticoagulants. This was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of randomized trials that included 25,031 individuals age 75 years or older (10 trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Clinically relevant or major bleeding was similar to controls, which included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, low molecular weight heparin, or placebo (odds ratio [OR] 1.02; 95% CI 0.73-1.43).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal failure</strong> &ndash; All of the DOACs are dependent on renal clearance to some degree. Thus, the risk of DOAC-associated bleeding may be greater in patients with renal failure. If an anticoagulant is required in a hospitalized patient with significant renal insufficiency, DOACs should only be used with care if at all. For ambulatory patients, decisions regarding whether to anticoagulate and which agent to use must balance the risks of bleeding versus thrombosis; the properties of the individual anticoagulants must also be considered. A more detailed discussion of this issue is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thromboembolic-risk-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-and-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thromboembolic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coexisting hemostatic defects</strong> &ndash; Although not extensively studied in patients receiving DOACs, it is expected that coexisting hemostatic defects may increase bleeding risk. These may include inherited bleeding disorders or, more commonly, acquired conditions such as the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. The magnitude of the effect is likely to depend on the severity of the hemostatic defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The large randomized trials of DOACs versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation included a significant number of patients taking concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (usually less than 100 mg daily). Subgroup analyses from these trials indicate that adding chronic low-dose aspirin to a DOAC is associated with an approximately twofold increase in the risk of major bleeding. The same effect was also associated with the addition of aspirin to warfarin. This increase in bleeding suggests that coincident therapy with either aspirin or an NSAID should only be undertaken after assessing the risks and benefits of the therapy and after fully informing the patient of the risk.

Bleeding is assessed according to the site, rate of hemorrhage, and amount of blood loss. This includes a thorough physical examination with serial measurement of vital signs. Serial measurement of the hemoglobin level may be appropriate if there is concern about significant blood loss; of note, a fall in hemoglobin level is likely to be delayed with acute massive blood loss.

Given the short half-lives of these drugs, even short-term but unneeded interruption of therapy could result in avoidable thrombosis. Occasionally, bleeding that appears significant in fact is not (eg, some epistaxis or hemorrhoidal bleeds); in such cases, observation and local measures such as ice and pressure may allow resolution of the bleeding without requiring aggressive treatments that might expose the patient to the risks of reversal strategies and potential thrombosis due to withdrawal of anticoagulants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3105389\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of anticoagulation status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of anticoagulation is important both for predicting the course of the bleeding episode and which interventions will be required.

Increased anti-factor Xa activity may reflect the presence of continued anti-factor Xa anticoagulant effect; however, unless the assay used has been calibrated for the specific anticoagulant the patient is taking, the amount of anticoagulant effect present cannot be reliably determined. Thus, it is important to consult with laboratory personnel regarding how the assay behaves in the presence of each of the different factor Xa inhibitors. There is very little information regarding betrixaban, but a calibrated anti-factor Xa assay would be expected to correlate well with betrixaban concentrations.</p><p/><p>We do not use thromboelastography (TEG) or related point-of care coagulation tests to manage DOAC-associated bleeding.

However, PCCs have the potential to cause thrombosis at doses used to treat bleeding, and they are not known to be effective in treating DOAC-associated bleeding.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product information for the use of PCCs to reverse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> effect in warfarin-associated bleeding lists a maximum dose of 5000 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This dose cap is reasonable for warfarin because the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (PT and INR) can be measured following administration, and additional doses can be administered if repeat INR testing suggests that the warfarin effect has been incompletely reversed. By contrast, the use of PCCs to treat factor Xa inhibitor-associated bleeding is off-label, and there is no measure such as the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> that can be used to determine the need for further doses. The product information notwithstanding, we are not aware of any clinical evidence or strong biologic rationale that would support a dose cap for PCC. In the very rare instances where we choose to prescribe PCC for imminently life-threatening bleeding associated with factor Xa inhibitor use, we would prescribe 25 to 50 units per kg of actual body weight, irrespective of the patient's size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence to support treating immediately life-threatening bleeding from a factor Xa inhibitor with an unactivated PCC is based on preclinical models and observational studies. PCCs have been shown to attenuate bleeding or to correct coagulation tests in experimental models of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/36-45,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-45,58</a>]. In a retrospective series of 84 individuals who had active, major bleeding (mostly intracranial hemorrhage) associated with a direct factor Xa inhibitor and were treated with a fixed dose of a 4-factor PCC (1500 or 2000 units for body weight &lt;65 kg or &gt;65 kg, respectively; equivalent to approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg),</span> hemostasis was judged to be effective in 58 (69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Although the high proportion of patients who were judged to have achieved good hemostasis is encouraging, the lack of a comparator group makes it impossible to know the magnitude of benefit (if any) that can be attributed to the PCC. Two individuals developed ischemic stroke 5 and 10 days after PCC treatment; both had a history of atrial fibrillation and prior ischemic stroke. A third patient had a suspected pulmonary embolism that could not be confirmed. As noted above, PCCs are potentially prothrombotic, and clinical judgment is required in determining the individual bleeding and thrombotic risks of each patient on a case-by-case basis. For most patients with bleeding where there is not an imminent risk of death, we suggest not using a PCC, based on the lack of high-quality evidence that the benefits will outweigh the risks.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plasma-derivatives-and-recombinant-dna-produced-coagulation-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plasma derivatives and recombinant DNA-produced coagulation factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several mechanisms may contribute to the potential efficacy of these products; none have been definitively demonstrated to work by these mechanisms in the setting of DOAC-associated bleeding. Clotting factors circulate in an unactivated form and become activated at the site of a wound. Thus, administration of the unactivated products might be effective primarily by &quot;overwhelming&quot; the anticoagulant rather than by promoting hemostasis; however, this argument is hard to rationalize given that DOACs do not bind to zymogen (unactivated) clotting factors. At the site of bleeding, there is vascular injury and local thrombin generation; thus, the unactivated PCCs will become activated and enhance the local pro-hemostatic effect. By contrast, the activated products may promote hemostasis directly by providing activated factors at sites of bleeding, which could theoretically overwhelm the local inhibitory effect of the DOAC.</p><p>Thrombosis is a potential risk with any pro-hemostatic agent. We generally regard aPCC as having a higher likelihood of precipitating a thrombotic event than unactivated PCC. However, there is little or no high-quality evidence that can be used to estimate the risk of thrombosis after the use of different PCC products, and it is not possible to quantify the degree to which an aPCC increases thrombosis risk (or promotes hemostasis) compared with an unactivated PCC. Since there is very little evidence that giving either of these products is of benefit to a patient with DOAC-associated bleeding, we would use them only in life-threatening circumstances. If we do use one of these products, we would have a weak preference for an unactivated PCC because, in our opinion, it is less likely to cause harm (eg, it is less likely to cause a thrombosis).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs)</strong> &ndash; Unactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs; also called &quot;non-activated PCCs&quot;) are concentrates of coagulation factors and anticoagulants purified from plasma.
