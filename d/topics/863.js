Hormones are chemical messengers that turn different body processes on and off. Androgens are often called &quot;male hormones.&quot; That's because they are the main hormones that make men different from women.</p><p>People often think that only men have androgens and only women have female hormones (called &quot;estrogens&quot;). But the fact is, men and women both have androgens and estrogens. The difference is that men normally have much higher levels of androgens than women. And women normally have much higher levels of estrogens than men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91530326\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a man need androgen replacement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A man might need androgen replacement if he has low levels of an androgen called &quot;testosterone.&quot; There are a few different androgens, but testosterone is the main one.</p><p>Symptoms of low testosterone in men can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired, especially at the end of the day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Little or no interest in sex &ndash; Doctors call this &quot;low libido.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling depressed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developing breasts &ndash; Doctors call this &quot;gynecomastia.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91530343\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I need androgen replacement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have symptoms of low testosterone, the doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. He or she will also order a blood test to check your testosterone level. Depending on your individual situation, you might also have other tests.</p><p>It's important to talk to your doctor if you think you might need androgen replacement. That way you can get tested to see if low testosterone is really the cause of your symptoms. (There are other problems that can cause symptoms like feeling tired and losing interest in sex.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91530360\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits of androgen replacement in men?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal interest in sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being less depressed or irritable</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91530377\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there side effects to androgen replacement in men?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some men who have androgen replacement with testosterone have side effects. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High amounts of red blood cells, especially in men who take testosterone shots</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots (but this is rare)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth of the prostate gland &ndash; The prostate is a gland that surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out through the penis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67279\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67279 \">figure 1</a>). Taking testosterone can cause the prostate to become enlarged, especially in older men. Doctors call this &quot;benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot; or &quot;BPH.&quot; It can cause problems with urinating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A possible increase in the risk of heart attack or stroke &ndash; Experts are worried that testosterone treatments might increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in some men. This has not been proven, but doctors are careful about when to suggest testosterone, especially in older men.</p><p/><p>Men who have testosterone replacement need regular exams and blood tests to check testosterone levels and look for any side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91530394\"><span class=\"h1\">How is androgen replacement given?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several different forms. Testosterone can be given in an injection (shot) that goes into the muscle, patch, gel, or tablet you put on your gums. The table lists the names of different androgen replacement medicines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86166 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Men who use testosterone replacement patches, gels, or tablets must wash their hands after putting on the medicine. That's because testosterone can get on other people's skin. It can cause harmful side effects, especially in children. Patches and gels must be put on skin that is covered by clothes. This can help keep testosterone from getting on other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91530428\"><span class=\"h1\">Should men over 60 have androgen replacement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That's not always clear. Low testosterone is not always treated, especially in men older than 60. That's because it's normal for testosterone to drop slightly in men as they age. In fact, normal aging causes some of the same changes that happen in men with low testosterone, such as less energy or less interest in sex.</p><p>Men older than 60 might have testosterone replacement if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 2 or 3 blood tests show very low testosterone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have symptoms of low testosterone that bother them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms are not caused by another disease or condition that doctors can treat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have not had a heart attack or stroke &ndash; This is because experts are worried that testosterone treatment might increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in some men (but this has not been proven).</p><p/><p>Older men who have testosterone replacement need regular screening tests for prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91530445\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development-puberty-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Normal sexual development (puberty) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-men-develop-breasts-gynecomastia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When men develop breasts (gynecomastia) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-testosterone-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low testosterone in men (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecomastia-breast-enlargement-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
