Neoplasms that arise in this site can originate from the pancreas, duodenum, distal common bile duct (CBD), or the structures of the ampullary complex.</p><p>The ampulla of Vater is formed by the duodenal aspect of the sphincter of Oddi muscle, which surrounds the confluence of the distal CBD and main pancreatic duct as well as the papilla of Vater, a mucosal papillary mound at the distal insertion of these ducts on the medial wall of the duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786 \">figure 1</a>). Ampullary carcinomas are defined as those that arise within the ampullary complex, distal to the confluence of the distal common bile duct and the pancreatic duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53240 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>This topic review will cover the treatment and prognosis of ampullary carcinomas. The epidemiology, biologic behavior, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis and staging are covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary carcinoma: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FOR LOCALIZED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only potentially curative treatment for ampullary carcinoma is surgical resection. Complete tumor resection with negative margins (R0 resection) is a prerequisite for cure.</p><p>It can be difficult to distinguish a primary ampullary carcinoma from other periampullary tumors preoperatively. However, true ampullary cancers have a better prognosis than periampullary malignancies of pancreatic or bile duct origin. Resectability rates are higher, and five-year survival rates are approximately 30 to 50 percent in patients with limited lymph node involvement. In contrast, less than 10 percent of patients with completely resected node-positive pancreatic cancer are alive at two years. Thus, an aggressive approach to diagnosis and treatment of periampullary tumors is needed to ensure that patients with these comparatively favorable cancers are treated optimally.</p><p>Current trends for locally advanced, borderline and categorically unresectable pancreatic cancer are to administer upfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy, prior to exploration. How initial treatment with chemoradiotherapy or with aggressive chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> plus short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>) will affect the prognosis of cancers in the periampullary region that turn out to be ampullary and not pancreatic head cancers at the time of resection is not known. At least some data suggest potential benefit for neoadjuvant therapy in a subset of patients with ampullary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but the selection of appropriate candidates is not established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial chemotherapy and radiation for nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable and borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreaticoduodenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple operation) is considered the standard approach for ampullary cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82519 \">figure 3</a>). This can be done as a pylorus-preserving procedure or as a conventional pancreaticoduodenectomy, which includes an antrectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60689 \">figure 4</a>). Although some authors claim advantages of a pylorus-preserving procedure because of a shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], this is based on European variations of the technique, which require creation of a Roux-en-Y to anastomose separately the gastric from the pancreatic and biliary anastomosis. Otherwise, there are no differences in long-term survival, and some series have shown higher incidence of delayed gastric emptying with the pylorus preservation. The impact of a pylorus-preserving procedure on long-term gastrointestinal function is less certain. Some studies suggest an improved nutritional state (as reflected by faster weight gain in the first postoperative year), but results have been inconsistent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pylorus-preserving-pancreaticoduodenectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical outcomes from pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer have improved over time. In contemporary single-institution series, rates of potentially curative resection have increased from approximately 80 to over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Long-term survival is possible after pancreaticoduodenectomy, even for patients with lymph node metastases or invasion beyond the duodenal wall (T3 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110872 \">table 1</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although pancreaticoduodenectomy has been associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates in the past, contemporary series show that in experienced hands, perioperative (30-day) mortality rates are between 0 and 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3-7,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7,9-12</a>]. Perioperative morbidity rates are between 20 and 40 percent, with the most common problems being anastomotic (pancreatic) leak, delayed gastric emptying, and intraabdominal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>These improved outcomes have been attributed to better operative technique and postoperative care. One of the most important reasons for this is the greater experience of a limited number of surgeons who perform the procedure regularly in high-volume institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Good outcomes have been described even in patients older than 80 years in such centers. However, even within high-volume hospitals, operative mortality rates from pancreaticoduodenectomy vary considerably depending upon the experience of the individual surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative biliary drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common presenting symptom of ampullary carcinoma is obstructive jaundice (80 percent) caused by obstruction or compression of the distal bile duct by the tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary carcinoma: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of preoperative biliary drainage in patients with periampullary tumors is controversial. Because obstructive jaundice can impair hepatic, renal, and immune function, it was hoped that preoperative relief of jaundice would correct these defects and decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality rates from pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, the available data from randomized trials of preoperative drainage versus no drainage are conflicting. Furthermore, three meta-analyses examining the benefit of preoperative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice have come to different conclusions, with one finding neither an adverse nor a favorable impact of preoperative stenting on the incidence of postoperative morbidity or mortality, another finding an overall adverse impact of stenting on the postoperative complication rate, and the third, significantly fewer postoperative complications in the stented group but no impact on postsurgical mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas#H176949634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;, section on 'Conventional versus pylorus preserving'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgery-in-the-treatment-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer-and-prognosis#H284616254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgery in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Role of preoperative biliary drainage'</a>.)</p><p>In the specific setting of ampullary cancer, the benefit of preoperative biliary drainage was addressed in a retrospective series of 82 patients undergoing potentially curative surgery at a single hospital in Singapore; 35 were drained preoperatively and 47 were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Preoperative drainage was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative wound infection (3 versus 26 percent), but there was no favorable impact on other postoperative complications or survival.</p><p>Uncertainty as to the benefit of preoperative drainage has led to differing approaches. Some surgeons routinely decompress jaundiced patients with an endoscopically placed stent prior to surgery. However, others reserve biliary decompression for selected patients in whom surgery will be delayed or those with debilitating pruritus or a clinical picture of cholangitis with fever and leucocytosis.</p><p>In practice, the majority of patients who present with obstructive jaundice will have been stented by a gastroenterologist before the diagnosis is established and it is known whether or not the patient is a surgical candidate; the surgeon usually has little influence on the decision. For those who are not stented, our preference is to proceed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting only when there is high-grade jaundice (&gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> of bilirubin) and surgery will not take place within the following week.</p><p>The prognostic implication of obstructive jaundice at presentation on prognosis is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive jaundice'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent treatment-related complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy is pancreatic fistula, and the rates are higher for patients with ampullary cancer than for pancreas cancer because the pancreatic parenchyma is typically normal in ampullary carcinoma. Other complications include delayed gastric emptying, hemorrhage, sepsis, bile leaks, and postoperative diabetes as a result of pancreatic resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas#H176949700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;, section on 'Perioperative morbidity and mortality'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Local resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with ampullary cancer are elderly and have significant comorbidities. This has generated interest in less aggressive surgical options, such as local resection or ampullectomy for selected patients.</p><p>Experience with this approach is limited to small published series, in which most of the patients were considered high-risk candidates for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,20-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20-30</a>]. Comparison of these studies with each other is limited by different eligibility criteria for ampullectomy and the fact that the extent of surgery (eg, &quot;ampullectomy&quot; versus &quot;local resection&quot;) has not always been clearly specified.</p><p>In the aggregate, the available data indicate that local resection is associated with lower morbidity than pancreaticoduodenectomy, but at the expense of higher recurrence rates and inferior survival, at least in the setting of invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13,23,25,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,25,31-35</a>].</p><p>The largest series included 37 patients who were planned for ampullectomy rather than pancreaticoduodenectomy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center because of significant comorbidity or a small ampullary lesion (median 1.5 cm, range 0.4 to 4.2 cm) that was thought to represent a benign adenoma after a preoperative biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Intraoperatively, eight cases were converted from ampullectomy to pancreaticoduodenectomy because of disease extent or a frozen-section finding of invasive tumor. Eight of the 29 patients treated by ampullectomy alone had invasive tumor on the final histology; seven recurred, and only one was alive at last follow-up. In contrast, of the 91 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy during the same time period for invasive adenocarcinoma, 68 were still alive at the end of the study period, 49 without recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Early, low-grade tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to pancreaticoduodenectomy, ampullectomy does not accomplish removal of the regional lymph nodes. Because of the low rate of nodal metastases (less than 4 percent in most series), some have suggested that local resection is a reasonable approach for well-differentiated small (&lt;6 mm) tumors that do not penetrate through the ampullary musculature (ie, Tis, T1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110872 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/30,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,36-39</a>].</p><p>However, the majority of the patients reported in these series had ampullary adenomas, and few had carcinomas. A major concern is the inferior cancer-specific survival following local resection of small ampullary invasive carcinomas in the analysis from Sloan-Kettering described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Furthermore, in other series, 45 percent of patients with pathologically confirmed T1 invasive ampullary adenocarcinomas had lymph node metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Thus, while local ampullary excision could be considered for high-risk patients with well-differentiated T1 ampullary cancers that are less than 6 mm based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), a more aggressive surgical approach is preferred by most surgeons for invasive tumors, including well-differentiated T1 lesions, as long as the patient is a reasonable candidate for pancreaticoduodenectomy.</p><p>In our view, local resection (ampullectomy with lymph node sampling) is a reasonable alternative to pancreaticoduodenectomy for selected patients with noninvasive (pTis) tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110872 \">table 1</a>). However, pancreaticoduodenectomy is preferred for any invasive adenocarcinoma, if the patient can tolerate this approach.</p><p>Recommendations for management of ampullary carcinoma are not included in published guidelines from either the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] or the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally-invasive nonsurgical therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive nonsurgical therapies for ampullary carcinoma include endoscopic snare resection, Nd:YAG laser ablation, and photodynamic therapy. While potentially curative in the setting of ampullary adenomas, all three modalities of nonsurgical treatment provide palliative rather than curative benefit for patients with ampullary carcinoma. These methods are appropriate only for patients who are not operative candidates and those who refuse surgery.</p><p>The literature on these techniques in the setting of ampullary carcinoma is limited to single-case reports and small series.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic snare resection (papillectomy) is an effective means of treating ampullary adenomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-adenomas-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary adenomas: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Endoscopic papillectomy has been attempted in early stage (Tis, T1) well-differentiated ampullary cancers without angiolymphatic invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, acceptance of this method for definitive treatment is hampered by the inadequacy of biopsy in terms of correct pathologic characterization of the lesion (and therefore its risk of harboring lymph node metastases) and the inability to predict successful, margin-negative endoscopic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,43-46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Endoscopic debulking has been used mainly preoperatively to permit stent insertion and decompression of the biliary tree.

In one such series of 12 patients with ampullary cancer, duodenal obstruction was relieved in one, and the longest survival was 36 months (median 21 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with laser ablation, photodynamic therapy (PDT) eradicates local tumor with less surrounding tissue destruction. PDT uses a photosensitizing drug (a hematoporphyrin derivative, Photofrin), which is disproportionately retained by malignant tissue after intravenous administration. Irradiation with visible light via a light-transmitting catheter (light-guide) placed through an endoscope and targeted at the tumor energizes the photosensitizing molecule within the tumor and catalyzes oxygen free-radical generation leading to cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The major side effect of PDT is prolonged cutaneous photosensitivity after the procedure, requiring the patient to avoid sunlight and wear appropriate clothing to protect the skin for several weeks after treatment.

The median number of resected nodes was 16, and patients with 16 or more examined nodes had a significantly lower recurrence rate and better five-year survival (81 versus 45 percent) than patients whose pathology material contained 16 or fewer nodes.

A prospective, randomized study of 62 patients who underwent resection of ampullary carcinoma found no difference in the five-year survival in the group undergoing standard versus extended lymphadenectomy (56 versus 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The authors concluded that the added morbidity of extended lymphadenectomy could not be justified by the better oncologic outcomes. We agree with this conclusion, and do not routinely perform extended lymphadenectomy in these patients.

These data could be interpreted as demonstrating that early detection of ampullary carcinoma prior to the onset of obstructive jaundice is associated with a better oncologic outcome.

However, patients who require transfusion tend to be sicker as a group (or their tumors are more advanced, requiring more intraoperative dissection) than those who do not require transfusion. Therefore, the independent contribution of intraoperative blood transfusion to outcomes remains uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor marker elevation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated preoperative levels of the serum tumor markers CA 19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19-9, also called cancer antigen 19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are associated with a poorer prognosis relative to individuals with normal values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/54,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,83</a>].

The risk factors for locoregional and distant recurrence are slightly different. This was shown in a series of 127 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy for ampullary carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The median time to recurrence was 11.4 months, and the risk factors for locoregional recurrence were the presence of pancreatic invasion and tumor size. In contrast, lymph node metastasis was the sole risk factor for distant recurrence. Both pancreatic invasion and lymph node involvement were significant predictors of inferior survival.</p><p>The most common site of distant spread is the liver, but other sites include peritoneum, bone, supraclavicular lymph nodes and lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12,54,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,54,84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3730555887\"><span class=\"h2\">Our recommended approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of clinical trials are not definitive, and there is no consensus regarding the optimal management of patients after resection of an ampullary cancer.

However, we suggest that these patients be managed in a manner similar to the approach used for resected pancreatic cancer, even for those who have the intestinal histomolecular phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Histology and histomolecular phenotype'</a> above.)</p><p>Eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials evaluating the potential benefits of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoradiotherapy, as well as new therapies.

Therapy with gemcitabine alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81436 \">table 5</a>) or, where available, S-1 alone is a reasonable option, particularly for patients with a borderline performance status or a comorbidity profile that precludes intensive therapy.

A significant survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy was seen in the patients with gallbladder cancer (five-year survival 26 versus 14 percent), but not in those with ampullary cancer (five-year survival 28 versus 34 percent in the chemotherapy and control groups, respectively).</p><p>As noted above, a meta-analysis of 14 studies of adjuvant therapy in periampullary adenocarcinoma (including the two randomized trials discussed above) concluded that there was no survival benefit for any adjuvant strategy (adjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy) for treatment of periampullary cancers; however, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy were not analyzed separately from those of chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Also, as noted above, there were few T3 or T4 tumors in the analysis, and the data are most compelling for benefit of adjuvant therapy in this subgroup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTTREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posttreatment surveillance to detect recurrent or persistent disease is performed at regular intervals, although the optimal surveillance strategy is undefined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines are not available. Many clinicians follow patients every six months for five years and annually thereafter. Follow-up visits usually include history and clinical examination, and serum tumor markers (typically CEA and CA 19-9). The utility of periodic computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is unclear.</p><p>While the need for endoscopic surveillance is universally accepted, most published recommendations are similar to those reported after local resection of ampullary adenomas. A reasonable approach is surveillance endoscopy every six months for two years, then annually for an additional three to five years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-adenomas-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary adenomas: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMOTHERAPY FOR ADVANCED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data exist to guide physicians in the choice of chemotherapy, largely because of the rarity of this disease. Much of the data on chemotherapy for advanced ampullary cancer are in combined series that include patients with small bowel, pancreatic, and ampullary adenocarcinomas, or more commonly, ampullary plus biliary tract cancers. However, particularly because of recent advances in treatment of advanced disease, the distinction as to whether periampullary tumors are of intestinal, biliary, or pancreatic origin is particularly important for the selection of the treatment approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of small bowel neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Unresectable or metastatic disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for advanced cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H826484788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy for advanced exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'FOLFIRINOX'</a>.)</p><p>There is no consensus on the best management for patients with advanced ampullary carcinoma. Patients with ampullary cancer were included in the ABC trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> with and without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, although they represented a small minority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. There was a significant survival advantage to the combination both in terms of progression-free and overall survival, compared with gemcitabine alone. Many consider this to represent the standard regimen for advanced ampullary as well as biliary tract cancers, although others disagree, treating these patients more like those with advanced pancreatic cancer or small bowel adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ampullary-carcinoma-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy for advanced exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of small bowel neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Unresectable or metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be difficult to distinguish a primary ampullary carcinoma from other periampullary tumors (mainly pancreatic carcinoma or distal cholangiocarcinoma) preoperatively. However, true ampullary cancers have a better prognosis than pancreatic head cancers or distal cholangiocarcinomas, and within ampullary cancers, those with an intestinal phenotype probably have a better prognosis than those with a pancreatobiliary one. Resectability rates are higher, and five-year survival rates are 30 to 50 percent in selected patients with limited lymph node involvement. Thus, an aggressive approach to diagnosis and treatment of periampullary tumors is needed to ensure that patients with these comparatively favorable cancers are treated optimally. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampullary-carcinoma-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ampullary carcinoma: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend pancreaticoduodenectomy rather than local resection for most patients with invasive ampullary carcinomas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

However, a more aggressive surgical approach is preferred for patients who are candidates for pancreaticoduodenectomy because of better outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Local resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsurgical treatment modalities (ie, endoscopic snare resection, laser ablation, photodynamic therapy) provide palliative rather than curative benefit for patients with ampullary carcinoma. These methods should be restricted to patients who are not operative candidates and those who refuse surgery. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Minimally-invasive nonsurgical therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus regarding the optimal management of patients after resection of an ampullary adenocarcinoma. There are scant data to guide adjuvant treatment decisions, and the true benefit of such therapy remains uncertain. Nevertheless, many clinicians, including our group, treat these patients in a similar manner to those with resected pancreatic head adenocarcinomas. We offer adjuvant therapy to all patients with resected ampullary cancer stage T2N0 or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110872 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The approach differs in Europe and in the United States:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most European clinicians use chemotherapy alone after resection of an ampullary neoplasm. This approach is based upon the ESPAC-1 trial, which showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU)-containing chemotherapy (but not chemoradiotherapy) prolongs survival in resected pancreatic cancer; the German CONKO trial showing a survival benefit from adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> in the same patient population; and a preliminary report of the ESPAC-3 trial, suggesting a potentially clinically meaningful but statistically insignificant improvement in overall survival with adjuvant gemcitabine or leucovorin-modulated FU in ampullary cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-potentially-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment for potentially resectable exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American approach more often includes chemoradiotherapy as well as adjuvant chemotherapy. The following represents our approach to patients with resected ampullary tumors:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eligible patients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials evaluating the potential benefits of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoradiotherapy as well as new therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Off-protocol, we suggest a combination of concurrent chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with resected ampullary cancers stage T2N0 or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110872 \">table 1</a>) rather than observation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). During the concurrent chemoradiotherapy portion, we prefer infusional FU. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Based upon results from the ESPAC-4 trial, which was conducted in patients with resected pancreatic cancer, we suggest four to six months of combination chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109104 \">table 4</a>), rather than gemcitabine monotherapy, for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Therapy with gemcitabine alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81436 \">table 5</a>) or, where available, S-1 alone is a reasonable option, particularly for patients with a borderline performance status or a comorbidity profile that precludes intensive therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The optimal way to sequence FU-based chemoradiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy is unclear. Our preferred approach is to administer all of the chemotherapy initially. For patients who have no evidence of metastatic disease, we recommend chemoradiotherapy with concurrent infusional FU (250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily) to begin two to four weeks after finishing chemotherapy. This is the same approach we use for resected pancreatic cancer.

The optimal regimen for systemic therapy of true ampullary tumors has not been established. Based upon the results of the ABC trial, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> is a reasonable approach for patients who are able to tolerate it.
