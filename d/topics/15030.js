Several general mechanisms have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired biologic activity of the hormone &mdash; Impaired activity of the hormone is caused by mutations or post-transcriptional modification that result in production of an abnormal hormone molecule. Since response to the authentic hormone is normal, this circumstance is a &quot;pseudo-resistance.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired function of hormone receptor &mdash; Impaired receptor function is caused by mutations in the receptor gene, leading in defective or absent receptor protein. Receptor defects result in impaired or absent ability to bind the hormone, defective transmission of the signal produced by hormone binding, defective targeting to the site of action, or lack of receptor synthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative reduction in receptor in the absence of receptor gene defect &mdash; Reduced quantity of the receptor may be caused by decreased synthesis or accelerated degradation. These can occur in an absence of a defect in the receptor gene or molecule proper but involve substances that control such functions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postreceptor abnormalities &mdash; Cell-membrane hormone receptors, such as the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor, mediate hormone action by activating second messengers through interaction with guanine nucleotide-binding (Gs or Gq) proteins. Because these second messengers are activated by multiple hormones, some defects in postreceptor signaling pathways can give rise to impaired action of several hormones, as is the case in McCune-Albright syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty#H3989453\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;, section on 'McCune-Albright syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The syndromes of resistance to thyrotropin (TSH) and resistance to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) will be discussed here. Disorders of reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone, including resistance to thyroid hormone, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impaired-sensitivity-to-thyroid-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE TO TSH (RTSH)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RTSH is broadly defined as high serum TSH (hyperthyrotropinemia) of normal biological activity in the absence of goiter. Affected individuals have normal or hypoplastic thyroid glands, high serum TSH concentrations, and normal or low serum T4 and T3 concentrations. They are often identified at birth through neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of TSH action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TSH is the predominant regulator of thyroid growth and T4 and T3 synthesis and secretion. These actions are mediated through TSH-binding to the TSH receptor located on the plasma membrane of thyroid follicular cells. Activation of the TSH receptor results in activation of G proteins and then of the adenylyl cyclase-cyclic AMP pathway of signal transduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63929\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63929 \">figure 1</a>). At higher concentrations of TSH, the phospholipase C-phosphatidylinositol pathway is activated. The result is stimulation of thyroid follicular-cell growth and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The TSH receptor belongs to a superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that have an extracellular amino-terminal domain, seven transmembrane segments, and a cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It has some constitutive activity, so that thyroid function does not cease entirely in the absence of TSH. Expression of the TSH receptor gene is under the control of several factors, including the thyroid transcription factors 1 and 2 and by PAX8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence and inheritance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise prevalence of RTSH is not known. However, partial RTSH must not be uncommon, as one-third of infants born in the state of Illinois with high blood TSH levels (&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> maintain normal levels of T4 (&gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> and ongoing elevations of TSH when measured two to three weeks later (from the records of the Illinois State Laboratory) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H1227140187\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'High TSH, normal free T4 or total T4'</a>). RTSH is inherited in either autosomal recessive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or dominant manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis of RTSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three genetic causes of RTSH have been so far identified. They involve two distinct genes and linkage to a gene locus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Inactivating mutations in the TSH receptor gene located on chromosome 14</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This disorder was first described in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Forty-six families harboring 51 mutations have since been identified. The inheritance is recessive, equally split between homozygous and compound heterozygous gene mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Decreased action of TSH results in reduced T4 and T3 synthesis and secretion, with compensatory increase in TSH secretion. The absence of goiter and the presence of thyroid hypoplasia in these patients are compatible with the dominant role of TSH on the growth of the thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Though not uncommon, TSH receptor gene mutations rarely cause severe congenital hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. To a certain degree, the magnitude of serum TSH elevation and the thyroid status of the patient vary with the severity of the functional impairment of the mutant TSH receptor.</p><p>With some of the mutations, heterozygotes may have on the average higher serum TSH values, usually in the upper limit of normal or just above normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one series, 20 percent of young subjects with non-autoimmune hyperthyrotropinemia were heterozygotes for inactivating mutations of the TSH receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a sampling of a Japanese population, the frequency of heterozygous mutations of the TSH receptor was approximately 1:172, and the prevalence of homozygotes was approximately 1:118,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A complex phenotype of congenital hypothyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism has been described in the presence of a combination of inactivating mutations of the TSH receptor and mutations of the downstream G protein (GNAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Most loss-of-function mutations in the TSH receptor that have been identified are located in the extracellular domain of the TSH receptor, in contrast to the gain-of-function mutations that cause hyperthyroidism, which are located principally in the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Approximately half of the mutant TSH receptors have partial impairment of function, and in one-third of cases, affected subjects could maintain a euthyroid state by an appropriate increase in serum TSH levels (fully compensated RTSH).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">PAX8 gene mutations located on chromosome 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the first reported cases of PAX8 gene mutations were associated with thyroid dysgenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], these mutations also can cause RTSH. Patients often are indistinguishable clinically and by thyroid tests from those with loss-of-function mutations in the TSH receptor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. The impaired association of the mutant PAX8 with other transcription factors regulating the TSH receptor, thyroglobulin, and thyroperoxidase genes appear to be responsible for the RTSH phenotype.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Defect in the long arm of chromosome 15</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with similar clinical findings have no detectable TSH receptor or PAX8 gene mutations, nor do they have inactivating mutations in G-protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/5,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,18</a>]. The defect is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although the precise cause of their RTSH is not known, it is linked to a 2.9 Megabase interval on chromosome 15q25.3-26.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification and clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three phenotypes of resistance to TSH have been identified, representing different degrees of resistance to TSH. In subjects with TSH receptor gene defects, the phenotype correlates with the magnitude of functional impairment of the mutant TSH receptor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79922 \">figure 2</a>). This does not appear to be the case in RTSH caused by PAX8 gene mutations and those linked to the locus on chromosome 15. In such individuals, wide variations in both TSH and free T4 and T3 are observed in affected individuals with the same mutation and within the same family (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79922 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/5,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Fully compensated defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impaired response to TSH is compensated by hypersecretion of TSH; this overcomes the resistance, resulting in euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia. In an individual patient with a mutation causing resistance to TSH, the phenotype tends to be stable over time. This course contrasts to that of acquired subclinical hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis, which, in the presence of antithyroid antibodies, tends to worsen over time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Partially compensated defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This occurs when the high serum TSH cannot fully compensate for the defect; affected individuals have mild hypothyroidism. This most often occurs in patients who are homozygous for the TSH receptor mutation, who may be euthyroid initially (elevated TSH with normal FT4; compensated RTSH), but often develop hypothyroidism over time (partially compensated RTSH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Uncompensated defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete lack of TSH receptor function results in severe hypothyroidism. This most often occurs when both alleles carry mutant TSH receptors with complete lack of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/9,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RTSH should be suspected in patients, particularly infants, who have high serum TSH concentrations, normal or low serum free T4 and T3 concentrations, and a normally located thyroid gland. The differential diagnosis includes all those conditions that impair thyroid secretion. Because of the important role of TSH in promoting thyroid growth, RTSH is unlikely if the patient has a goiter or ectopically located thyroid tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3988265948\"><span class=\"h3\">Subclinical hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is included in the differential diagnosis of compensated RTSH (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>). Both compensated RTSH and SCH have slight to mild elevations of TSH and normal free T4 and T3 concentrations. By definition, patients with SCH are &quot;subclinical&quot; and typically do not have symptoms, just as patients with compensated RTSH do not usually have symptoms of hypothyroidism. In adults, the most common cause of this phenotype is autoimmune thyroid disease, in which case the elevations of TSH reflects a mild state of hypothyroidism for that individual, although free T4 concentrations are within the normal range for the general population. By contrast, in patients with compensated RTSH, the elevated TSH is caused by reduced action of a normal TSH molecule, eg, due to mutations in the TSH receptor. This is more likely in children, or in families with a history of a similar phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of RTSH'</a> above.)</p><p>The presence of a mutation in a gene known to cause RTSH would distinguish the two conditions. However, since the prevalence of SCH is 4 to 15 percent of the population it would not be practical to recommend genetic testing for all patients diagnosed with SCH. Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish these two conditions as diagnosis of compensated RTSH does not require treatment with LT4, while many argue that SCH should be treated, depending on the patient's age and level of elevation of the TSH. Therefore, we suggest genetic testing for suspected RTSH in patients with the following characteristics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of a history of prior normal thyroid function tests. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of RTSH phenotype in other family members (eg, familial occurrence without thyroid enlargement). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of thyroid hormone abnormalities during infancy or childhood (since SCH is not common in children). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296478685\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other diagnoses that should be considered in patients with biochemical characteristics consistent with RTSH (slightly elevated TSH concentration and normal free T4 and T3 concentrations) include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of<strong> human-antimouse antibodies (HAMA)</strong> that can cause an elevated TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels.

While the free T4 and T3 values are normal, TSH is high. A distinguishing feature is that serum TSH levels tend to be higher in macro TSH compared with RTSH. Confirmation of macro TSH can be made either by column chromatography in which the TSH peak is eluted in the void volume thus indicating a high molecular weight, or by polyethylene glycol precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p>Several studies have examined the role of polymorphisms in the TSH receptor gene, but have been unable to fully explain the wide range of normal TSH concentrations in the &quot;normal population&quot;. One study has shown that 13 of 116 adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, but without evidence of autoimmune thyroid disease, were heterozygous for TSH receptor gene mutations, most of which were proven to result in loss-of-function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with fully compensated RTSH are euthyroid and need no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There is no evidence that in the absence of other risk factors, persistent elevation of serum TSH levels produces TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas or thyroid neoplasia.</p><p>Individuals with mutations in both alleles of the TSH receptor may be euthyroid initially (elevated TSH with normal FT4; compensated RTSH), but often develop mild hypothyroidism over time (partially compensated RTSH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/resistance-to-thyrotropin-and-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Individuals with partially compensated or uncompensated RTSH should be treated with L-T4, like any other hypothyroid patient. Because these individuals have normal responsiveness to thyroid hormone, the goal is to normalize their serum TSH concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE TO THYROTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a rare disorder that is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.
