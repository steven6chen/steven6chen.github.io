It is associated with a relative or absolute impairment in insulin secretion, along with varying degrees of peripheral resistance to the action of insulin. Every few years, the diabetes community reevaluates the current recommendations for the classification, diagnosis, and screening of diabetes, reflecting new information from research and clinical practice.</p><p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) issued diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus in 1997, with follow-up in 2003 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The diagnosis is based on one of four abnormalities: glycated hemoglobin (A1C), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), random elevated glucose with symptoms, or abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61853\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61853 \">table 1</a>). Patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are referred to as having increased risk for diabetes or prediabetes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Screening for and prevention of diabetes is reviewed elsewhere. The etiologic classification of diabetes mellitus is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2386084\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2 diabetes is by far the most common type of diabetes in adults (&gt;90 percent) and is characterized by hyperglycemia and variable degrees of insulin deficiency and resistance. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further testing. The frequency of symptomatic diabetes has been decreasing in parallel with improved efforts to diagnose diabetes earlier through screening (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). Classic symptoms of hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently, weight loss. These symptoms are often noted only in retrospect after a blood glucose value has been shown to be elevated. Polyuria occurs when the serum glucose concentration rises significantly above 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> exceeding the renal threshold for glucose, which leads to increased urinary glucose excretion. Glycosuria causes osmotic diuresis (ie, polyuria) and hypovolemia, which in turn can lead to polydipsia. Patients who replete their volume losses with concentrated sugar drinks, such as non-diet sodas, exacerbate their hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis.</p><p>Rarely adults with type 2 diabetes can present with a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, characterized by marked hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis, severe dehydration, and obtundation. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the presenting symptom of type 2 diabetes is also uncommon in adults but may occur under certain circumstances (usually severe infection or other illness) and in non-Caucasian ethnic groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 5 to 10 percent of diabetes in adults. DKA may be the initial presentation in approximately 25 percent of adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Compared with children, the loss of insulin secretory capacity usually is less rapid in adults with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, adults with type 1 diabetes typically have a longer estimated period prior to diagnosis and are likely to have a longer period with symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue) than children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 2 to 12 percent of adults, the clinical presentation is similar to that of type 2 diabetes (not initially insulin dependent), with autoimmune mediated insulin deficiency developing later in the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is sometimes called latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA).

However, if two different tests (eg, FPG and A1C) are available and are concordant for the diagnosis of diabetes, additional testing is not needed. If two different tests are discordant, the test that is diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The importance of confirming the diagnosis by repeat measurement on a subsequent day, especially when the diagnosis is based upon plasma glucose measurements, is illustrated by a report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III Second Examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prevalence of diabetes based upon either FPG or two-hour, post-OGTT plasma glucose concentration significantly decreased when the diagnosis was contingent upon having two abnormal measurements rather than a single abnormal measurement.</p><p>If measurement of A1C test is either unavailable or uninterpretable (for example, owing to rapid red cell turnover in a patient with anemia), the previous diagnostic methods and criteria, using glucose testing (FPG, two-hour OGTT), should be used. The A1C assay and potential sources of error are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimation-of-blood-glucose-control-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimation of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycated hemoglobin'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic criteria have been developed based upon the observed association between glucose levels and the risk for developing retinopathy. FPG values &ge;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> two-hour, post-OGTT values of &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> and A1C values &ge;6.5 percent (48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> are associated with an increased prevalence of retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Not surprisingly, since the different measures of glycemia (FPG, two-hour plasma glucose, and A1C) represent different physiologic phenomena, each of the measures will identify different proportions of the population with diabetes. For example, the shift from using the FPG to using A1C to diagnose diabetes may decrease the proportion of patients identified as having diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/6,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-10</a>]. As an example, in a study of 6890 adults without a history of diabetes participating in the NHANES (1999 to 2006), the prevalence of diabetes using A1C versus FPG criteria was 2.3 versus 3.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Overall, the A1C and FPG criteria resulted in the same classification for 98 percent of the population studied. Similarly, the OGTT identifies different groups than an FPG level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">WHO criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria define diabetes as an FPG &ge;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or a two-hour, post-OGTT value &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. In 2011, the WHO concluded that an A1C value of &ge;6.5 percent (48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> can be used as a diagnostic test for diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

A strict quality control program has improved precision and accuracy of assays in the United States and many international assays. There are also several technical advantages of the A1C assay over plasma glucose testing, increased patient convenience (since there is no special preparation or timing required for the A1C test), and the correlation of A1C levels with mean glucose concentrations and diabetes complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/3,13,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,20,21</a>].

Our approach to identifying candidates for diabetes prevention is reviewed separately.

Although most of the high-risk groups have been defined categorically (eg, impaired fasting glucose [IFG] or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]), the risk for developing type 2 diabetes follows a continuum across the entire spectrum of subdiabetic glycemic values.

There is consistent evidence that the relationship between blood glucose levels and cardiovascular risk extends into the nondiabetic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 24 prospective cohort studies with median follow-up of 9.5 years, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or increases in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) in the nondiabetic range (5.7 to 6.4 percent or 6.0 to 6.4 percent) was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with normoglycemia (relative risk [RR] 1.10 to 1.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. IFG or IGT (but not increases in A1C) was also associated with an increased risk of stroke (18 studies, RR 1.06 to 1.20) and overall mortality (25 studies, RR 1.13 to 1.32).</p><p>Although there is a correlation between measures of glycemia and cardiovascular risk, their addition to conventional cardiovascular risk factors is not associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in prediction of CVD risk. An analysis of individual patient data from 73 prospective studies (294,998 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] showed that the addition of A1C to prognostic models containing conventional cardiovascular risk factors (age, gender, blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, smoking) significantly improved the models' ability to predict the development of CVD; however, the incremental improvement was small and of little clinical relevance. The improvement provided by A1C was at least equal to estimated improvements for measurement of fasting, random, or postload glucose levels. These findings suggest that in individuals without known CVD or diabetes, traditional cardiovascular risk factors are much stronger predictors of CVD than measures of glycemia. The co-incidence of and relationship between hyperglycemia and traditional risk factors makes the analysis of their individual contributions particularly challenging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3432848\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90 percent of cases of diabetes in the United States, Canada, and Europe; type 1 diabetes accounts for another 5 to 10 percent, with the remainder due to other causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59403 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Transient hyperglycemia may occur during severe illness in adults without known diabetes mellitus. This is sometimes referred to as stress hyperglycemia and is a consequence of many factors, including increased serum concentrations of cortisol, catecholamines, glucagon, growth hormone, which leads to increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and insulin resistance. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia associated with critical illness has been associated with poor outcomes, potentially because such hyperglycemia is an index of the severity of the underlying illness, but possibly because of pernicious effects of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia.

However, not all patients develop diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In a prospective study of 2124 patients without known diabetes admitted to a hospital with pneumonia, 1418 (67 percent) had varying degrees of stress hyperglycemia (admission plasma glucose 110 to 360 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [6.1 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Over five years, a greater proportion of patients with stress hyperglycemia subsequently developed diabetes (14 versus 6 percent of patients with normal glycemia). The risk of a new diagnosis of diabetes increased with increasing degrees of stress hyperglycemia: 7, 18, and 47 percent for mild (110 to 139 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [6.1 to 7.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> moderate (140 to 198 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [7.8 to 11.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> and severe (200 to 360 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 to 20.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> hyperglycemia, respectively. In most patients with severe stress hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed within one year. Thus, patients with stress hyperglycemia require follow-up testing after discharge to identify underlying diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475784578\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further testing. Classic symptoms of hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently, weight loss. These symptoms are often noted only in retrospect after an elevated blood glucose value has been documented. (See <a href=\"#H2386084\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be the initial presentation in approximately 25 percent of adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Compared with children, the loss of insulin secretory capacity usually is less pronounced in adults with type 1 diabetes, and therefore, adults with type 1 diabetes typically have a longer symptomatic period (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue) prior to diagnosis than children. In some adults, the clinical presentation is similar to that of type 2 diabetes (ie, they are not initially insulin dependent), with autoimmune-mediated insulin deficiency developing later in the course of disease. (See <a href=\"#H2386084\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is easily established when a patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (thirst, polyuria, weight loss, blurry vision) and has a random plasma glucose value of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or higher.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of diabetes in an asymptomatic individual can be established with the following criteria: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values &ge;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> two-hour, post-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) values of &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values &ge;6.5 percent (48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61853\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61853 \">table 1</a>).
