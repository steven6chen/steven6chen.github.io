Creatine kinase (CK) levels are typically markedly elevated, and muscle pain and myoglobinuria may be present. The severity of illness ranges from asymptomatic elevations in serum muscle enzymes to life-threatening disease associated with extreme enzyme elevations, electrolyte imbalances, and acute kidney injury.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis will be reviewed here. The causes of rhabdomyolysis; the clinical features and diagnosis of acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis; the management of patients with rhabdomyolysis, including methods to prevent acute kidney injury and related metabolic complications; and the prevention and management of acute compartment syndrome are discussed in detail separately.

The degree of muscle pain and other symptoms varies widely. Rhabdomyolysis associated with viral infection is discussed in further detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-viral-myositis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of viral myositis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25330880\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic triad of complaints in rhabdomyolysis is muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. However, more than half of patients may not report muscular symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; by contrast, occasional others may experience very severe pain. Muscle pain, when present, is typically most prominent in proximal muscle groups, such as the thighs and shoulders, and in the lower back and calves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Other muscle symptoms include stiffness and cramping.</p><p>Additional symptoms that are more common in severely affected patients include malaise, fever, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Altered mental status may occur from the underlying etiology (eg, toxins, drugs, trauma, or electrolyte abnormalities).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25330888\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle tenderness and swelling may be seen, but detectable muscle swelling in the extremities generally develops, when it occurs, with fluid repletion. Such swelling is much less common on hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Muscle weakness may be present, depending upon the severity of muscle injury. Limb induration is occasionally present. Skin changes of ischemic tissue injury, such as discoloration or blisters, may also be seen but are present in less than 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25330896\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of rhabdomyolysis is an elevation in CK and other serum muscle enzymes. The other characteristic finding is the reddish-brown urine of myoglobinuria, but because this may be observed in only half of cases, its absence does not exclude the diagnosis. Routine lab tests, including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), vary greatly depending on the underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis. Infections and crush injuries are associated with marked elevation of the acute phase reactants and peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count, while these markers of inflammation would likely be normal or only minimally raised in patients with other etiologies, such as drug-induced or electrolyte derangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25326274\"><span class=\"h3\">Creatine kinase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum CK levels at presentation are usually at least five times the upper limit of normal, but range from approximately 1500 to over 100,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>. The mean peak CK reported for each of a variety of different causes and for patients with both single and multiple causes ranged from approximately 10,000 to 25,000 in the largest series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; exceptions were the three patients with malignant hyperthermia, whose values averaged almost 60,000.</p><p>The CK is generally entirely or almost entirely of the MM or skeletal muscle fraction; a small proportion of the total CK may be from the MB or myocardial fraction. The presence of MB reflects the small amount found in skeletal muscle rather than the presence of myocardial disease. Elevations in serum aminotransferases are common and can cause confusion if attributed to liver disease. In one study, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was elevated in 93.1 percent and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 75 percent of rhabdomyolysis cases in which the CK was greater than or equal to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In only one instance was the ALT greater than the AST, although the AST declines faster than the ALT as the rhabdomyolysis resolves, such that the two may equalize after a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-enzymes-in-the-evaluation-of-neuromuscular-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muscle enzymes in the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The serum CK begins to rise within 2 to 12 hours following the onset of muscle injury and reaches its maximum within 24 to 72 hours. A decline is usually seen within three to five days of cessation of muscle injury. CK has a serum half-life of about 1.5 days and declines at a relatively constant rate of about 40 to 50 percent of the previous day's value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/5,6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,11</a>]. In patients whose CK does not decline as expected, continued muscle injury or the development of a compartment syndrome may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25326281\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine findings and myoglobinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myoglobin, a heme-containing respiratory protein, is released from damaged muscle in parallel with CK. Myoglobin is a monomer that is not significantly protein-bound and is therefore rapidly excreted in the urine, often resulting in the production of red to brown urine. It appears in the urine when the plasma concentration exceeds 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Visible changes in the urine only occur once urine levels exceed from about 100 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> although it can be detected by the urine (orthotolidine) dipstick at concentrations of only 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Myoglobin has a half-life of only two to three hours, much shorter than that of CK. Because of its rapid excretion and metabolism to bilirubin, serum levels may return to normal within six to eight hours.</p><p>Thus, it is not unusual for CK levels to remain elevated in the absence of myoglobinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In rhabdomyolysis, myoglobin appears in the plasma before CK elevation occurs and disappears while CK is still elevated or rising. Therefore, there is no CK threshold for when myoglobin appears. As above, rhabdomyolysis does not occur unless CK is elevated five times or more above the upper limit of normal (see <a href=\"#H25326274\" class=\"local\">'Creatine kinase'</a> above). Routine urine testing for myoglobin by urine dipstick evaluation may be negative in up to half of patients with rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pigmenturia will be missed in rhabdomyolysis if the filtered load of myoglobin is insufficient or has largely resolved before the patient seeks medical attention due to its rapid clearance.</p><p>Both hemoglobin and myoglobin can be detected on the urine dipstick as &quot;blood&quot;; microscopic evaluation of the urine generally shows few red blood cells (RBC) (less than five per high-powered field) in patients with rhabdomyolysis whose positive test results from myoglobinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Such testing is not a reliable method for rapid detection of myoglobin if RBC are present or in patients with hemolysis due to its lack of specificity for myoglobin. Hemoglobin, the other heme pigment capable of producing pigmented urine, is much larger (a tetramer) than myoglobin and is protein-bound. As a result, much higher plasma concentrations are required before red to brown urine is seen, resulting in a change in plasma color. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H1824471583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Red to brown urine'</a>.)</p><p>Proteinuria may also be seen, due to the release of myoglobin and other proteins by the damaged myocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one study, it was detected by dipstick in 45 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25330918\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other manifestations of rhabdomyolysis include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, many of which precede or occur in the absence of kidney failure, and hepatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; additionally, cardiac dysrhythmias and risk of cardiac arrest may result from the severe hyperkalemia that occurs with significant myonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Levels of potassium may increase rapidly, but the levels of potassium and phosphate decrease as they are excreted in the urine. Hyperkalemia is more common in patients with oliguric acute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypocalcemia, which can be extreme, occurs in the first few days because of entry into damaged myocytes and both deposition of calcium salts in damaged muscle and decreased bone responsiveness to parathyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. During the recovery phase, serum calcium levels return to normal and may rebound to significantly elevated levels due to the release of calcium from injured muscle, mild secondary hyperparathyroidism from the acute renal failure, and an increase in calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

The visual and microscopic examination of the sediment from a fresh urine specimen is required to exclude the presence of red blood cells (RBC) as the cause of positive testing; RBC in an older specimen may hemolyze over time, confounding the results.

The last two associations occur most commonly with carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency and the other disorders of lipid metabolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a history of exercise intolerance, recurrent cramps, and fatigue beginning in childhood, and episodes of pigmenturia occurring in adolescence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a family history of rhabdomyolysis or exercise intolerance, particularly in siblings, thereby suggestive of an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The individual has normal strength and muscle enzymes during interictal periods. One exception is muscle phosphorylase deficiency, a disorder in which chronic muscle weakness may develop after repeated episodes and CK levels do not return to normal between attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myophosphorylase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-v-mcardle-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myophosphorylase deficiency (glycogen storage disease V, McArdle disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The diagnostic approach to a suspected metabolic myopathy is discussed separately. Histochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy specimen will demonstrate the deficient enzyme. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies#H400795568\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the metabolic myopathies&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25326714\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnoses of myalgia, elevated creatine kinase (CK) and other muscle enzymes, and dark urine are fairly extensive. However, when present together, and if the CK elevation is acute and myoglobinuria is present, the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis can generally be made with confidence. The following conditions may be considered, depending upon the combination of findings that are present, but distinctions can usually be made with readily available information from the medical history as well as the physical and laboratory examinations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial infarction &ndash; Although serum CK also rises acutely with myocardial infarction, patients with rhabdomyolysis alone do not have ischemic chest pain or electrocardiogram (ECG) signs of myocardial infarction. Additionally, the CK-MM fraction is elevated, while little or no CK-MB is present. Assays for cardiac troponins (both the I and T isoforms) are highly sensitive and specific for cardiac muscle injury, although both isoforms can sometimes be elevated in patients with rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The basis for this elevation is not clear but may relate to nonischemic cardiac events that may occur in patients with rhabdomyolysis, including seizures, sepsis, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], or, in the case of troponin T, to cross-reaction with diseased skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>].

Careful examination of the urine for red blood cells (present in hematuria, by definition), of serum for evidence of hemolysis, and of the CK (which is not elevated in hemolysis, or most patients with hematuria) will help distinguish these conditions. Other causes of red to brown urine include various foods and drugs, but such patients lack evidence of skeletal muscle injury, including CK elevation.

These patients can be differentiated from patients with rhabdomyolysis by the chronicity of disease, usually symmetric proximal muscle weakness developing over weeks to months, relative stability of the laboratory abnormalities compared with patients with rhabdomyolysis, and the systemic features associated with the inflammatory myopathies, such as dermatomyositis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with rhabdomyolysis generally do not exhibit electromyographic or histologic changes suggestive of myositis except in rare patients in whom both are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]; concurrent statin therapy may be a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The degree of myalgias and other symptoms varies widely, and some patients are asymptomatic. Fever, malaise, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms may be present. Muscle swelling may occur with rehydration. (See <a href=\"#H25330957\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25330880\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25330888\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory findings that characterize rhabdomyolysis include an acute elevation in the CK and other muscle enzymes and a decline in these values within three to five days of cessation of muscle injury. The other characteristic finding is the reddish-brown urine of myoglobinuria, but this finding is often absent because of the relative rapidity with which myoglobin is cleared. The serum CK is generally entirely or almost entirely of the MM or skeletal muscle fraction, although small amounts of the MB fraction may be present. (See <a href=\"#H25330896\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25326274\" class=\"local\">'Creatine kinase'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25326281\" class=\"local\">'Urine findings and myoglobinuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other manifestations include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, many of which precede or occur in the absence of acute kidney injury, and hepatic injury. Hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and metabolic acidoses may be seen. Hyperkalemia may result in cardiac dysrhythmias. Later complications include acute kidney injury (AKI), hypercalcemia, compartment syndrome, and, rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Key diagnostic laboratory studies include the creatine kinase and urinalysis, including dipstick and microscopic evaluation. Myoglobinuria (present in 50 to 75 percent of patients at the time of initial evaluation) results in a positive test for blood on the urine dipstick but without red blood cells on the microscopic examination of the urine.
