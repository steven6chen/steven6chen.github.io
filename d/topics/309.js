AOM primarily occurs in childhood, and the medical literature overwhelmingly focuses on the presentation, course, and treatment of AOM in children. The treatment of AOM in adults is therefore largely extrapolated from studies in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Life-threatening complications, though infrequent, may develop because of the proximity of the middle ear and adjacent mastoid to the middle and posterior cranial fossa and related structures. Based upon its high prevalence and potential to cause serious harm, otitis media is a public health concern.</p><p>This topic will address the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AOM in adults. Issues related to AOM in children are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Management&quot;</a>) Issues related to chronic otitis media (COM) in adults are also discussed separately.

The anatomy of the normal ear is shown in a figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63141\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63141 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute otitis media (AOM) is an acute illness marked by the presence of middle ear fluid and inflammation of the mucosa that lines the middle ear space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268 \">picture 1</a>). The infection is often caused by obstruction of the eustachian tube, which results in fluid retention and suppuration of retained secretions. AOM may also be associated with purulent otorrhea if there is a ruptured tympanic membrane. AOM usually responds promptly to antimicrobial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Otitis media with effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otitis media with effusion (OME) is defined by the presence of middle ear fluid without acute signs of illness or inflammation of the middle ear mucosa. OME usually follows AOM but can result from barotraumas or allergy. Eustachian tube dysfunction is often a predisposing factor. Rarely, OME is caused by obstruction of the eustachian tube orifice in the nasopharynx by a mass or cancer such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or as a result of radiation treatment for nasopharyngeal malignancy.</p><p>OME typically leads to a conductive hearing loss and can be a precursor to retraction and perforation of the tympanic membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute mastoiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mastoid is that portion of the petrous temporal bone that lies superior to the middle ear cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63141\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63141 \">figure 1</a>). The mastoid antrum serves as an air space connecting the middle ear to the mastoid air cells. Thus, most cases of AOM are associated with some degree of mastoid inflammation or infection (&quot;mastoiditis&quot;). However, the incidence of clinically significant mastoiditis has been low since the introduction of antibacterial drugs.</p><p>When pus does enter the mastoid air cells under pressure, it may lead to the dissolution of surrounding bone. This represents a serious process that often requires urgent surgical evacuation because the infection can spread to regional structures, including the central nervous system or neck. Mastoiditis can occur at any age but is far more common in children than adults; when it occurs in older adults, it may be particularly severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14530790\" class=\"local\">'Mastoiditis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic otitis media (COM) is diagnosed in an ear with a tympanic membrane perforation in the setting of chronic ear infections, such as an ear with chronic purulent drainage despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. COM may be benign and is often characterized by a dry tympanic membrane perforation. Continuous serous drainage (typically straw-colored) is termed chronic serous otitis media or COM with effusion, and chronic purulent drainage through a perforated tympanic membrane is termed chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-otitis-media-cholesteatoma-and-mastoiditis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, and mastoiditis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some otologists also classify COM based on the presence of either a chronic tympanic membrane perforation (&ldquo;COM mucosal disease&rdquo;) or cholesteatoma (&ldquo;COM benign squamous disease&rdquo;). The term &ldquo;active&rdquo; is also used if there is otorrhea, and &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; if it remains dry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic studies of acute otitis media (AOM) overwhelmingly involve pediatric or mixed populations. Data are unavailable to determine the incidence of AOM in an adult population. Surveys demonstrate that 80 percent of children will experience one or more episodes of AOM by the age of six [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of AOM markedly decreases after the age of seven.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of antibiotics, acute coalescent mastoiditis complicated AOM in approximately 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Reports indicate that mastoiditis and other infectious complications in adults develop in less than 0.5 percent of cases of AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3244861\"><span class=\"h2\">Eustachian tube dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important factor in the pathogenesis of middle ear infections is dysfunction of the eustachian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63141\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63141 \">figure 1</a>). Descent of the soft palate muscle sling relative to the eustachian tube orifice with adolescence improves the patency of the eustachian tube, resulting in the declining incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) with age. However, poor tubal function can persist into adulthood.</p><p>Persistent eustachian tube dysfunction induces a relative negative pressure in the middle ear space. The lack of aeration and the accumulation of effusions provide an environment conducive to the development of AOM or otitis media with effusion (OME).</p><p>Any entity resulting in eustachian tube dysfunction or obstruction can predispose to AOM. Common causes include seasonal allergic rhinitis and upper respiratory tract infections. Other causes of eustachian tube dysfunction relate to mucosal disease (inflammatory, immunologic impairment, or immotile cilia), extrinsic compression (nasopharyngeal tumor or enlarged adenoid), or palatal muscle dysfunction (cleft palate and other craniofacial anomalies). Radiation therapy may also be a predisposing factor due to induction of swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scarring in the eustachian tube and surrounding structures.

Data from adults identify patterns similar to infections in children, with dominance by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and non-typable (NT) <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>].

Relatively few serotypes are responsible for most disease, although there may be regional differences. The most frequent serotypes responsible for AOM, in decreasing order, are serotypes 19F, 14, 6B, 23F, 6A, and 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The seven serotype pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) used in children includes types 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. It was developed based upon the most prevalent serotypes responsible for invasive disease but also includes the major serotypes responsible for AOM, except for 6A and 3. A 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar 13) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2010, with additional serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A. Since the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine protects against carriage of vaccine serotypes, it is likely that the prevalent types responsible for AOM will change in immunized children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, NT <em>H. influenzae</em> may replace pneumococcus as the most frequently isolated pathogen of AOM in children immunized with PCV7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The durability of protection provided by the infant immunization schedule is uncertain but appears to be sufficient to cover the preschool years of highest attack rates for both invasive pneumococcal disease and AOM.

Respiratory viruses have been isolated from the nasopharynx in up to 50 percent of children with AOM and in approximately one-quarter of middle ear fluids from children with AOM. The most frequently isolated viruses are respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, and rhinoviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Combined bacterial and viral infections appear to be more severe than viral or bacterial episodes of AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Experimental infection of adult volunteers with <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> resulted in hemorrhagic bullous myringitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in the many studies of the microbiology of AOM, <em>M. pneumoniae</em> has rarely been identified. Some patients with lower respiratory tract infection due to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> have concurrent AOM, although the etiologic role of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> in the AOM is uncertain.</p><p>Fungi are frequently associated with otitis externa. <em>Candida</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> species, although infrequent, have been isolated from middle ear fluids of patients who developed CSOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Other uncommon causes of AOM include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diphtheritic otitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberculous otitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otogenous tetanus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>M. catarrhalis</em></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Biofilms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of biofilms in the pathophysiology of infections of the upper aerodigestive tract is increasingly recognized, particularly in antibiotic-resistant cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/2,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24,25</a>]. A biofilm begins as an aggregate of bacteria that attach to a surface. Such bacteria demonstrate reduced metabolism and replication rates.</p><p>Biofilms are difficult to eradicate since antibiotics cannot readily penetrate the formed matrix.

Biofilms have been identified in cholesteatomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and tympanostomy tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], supporting their role in resistant infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The respiratory mucosal membrane that lines the middle ear space and mastoid air cells provides an immunologic defensive barrier. The constantly renewed mucus that forms this barrier is rich in lysozyme, a potent antibacterial enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mucus production increases in response to an invading organism. In addition, inflammatory dilation of vessels, white blood cell migration, proteolytic enzyme activity, and antibody deposition contribute to the formation of mucopurulent secretions.</p><p>All of the major classes of immunoglobulins have been identified in middle ear effusions of patients with AOM. The presence of type-specific antibodies in middle ear effusions is associated with clearance of mucopurulent secretions and an early return to normal middle ear function.</p><p>The incidence of AOM and related complications is increased in children with congenital or acquired immunologic deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], a risk that persists into adulthood. The risks of AOM and its complications are also increased in patients who have a concomitant malignancy, use immunosuppressive drugs, or have a history of previous irradiation to the nasopharyngeal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of acute otitis media (AOM) in adults is typically associated with otalgia (ear pain) and decreased hearing. Fever may not be present. A preceding upper respiratory tract infection or exacerbation of seasonal allergic rhinitis may herald the onset of AOM by several days.</p><p>There is considerable variability in the symptoms and signs of AOM. The infection is typically but not always unilateral. A bulging tympanic membrane distinguishes AOM from otitis media with effusion (OME). (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268 \">picture 1</a>). The tympanic membrane may also be erythematous or opacified. If the tympanic membrane has ruptured (often reported by the patient as a relief of the otalgia), there may also be associated purulent otorrhea.</p><p>Dysequilibrium is described infrequently. Conductive hearing loss is usually transient. Other symptoms, such as high fever, severe pain behind the ear, or facial paralysis, suggest unusual complications.

The addition of pneumatoscopy allows evaluation of tympanic membrane motion and is thus highly recommended for diagnosis. Otomicroscopy, available in otorhinology specialty practices, allows even greater definition of the tympanic membrane.</p><p>Examination typically demonstrates tympanic membrane redness, opacification, bulging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63268 \">picture 1</a>), and poor mobility when pneumatic pressure is applied using a pneumatic otoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70700\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70700 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F93798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93798 \">picture 2</a>). The tympanic membrane is normally translucent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626 \">picture 3</a>). By contrast, the tympanic membrane appears cloudy, yellowish, or opaque when there is fluid in the middle ear. An air-fluid level is present when the tympanic membrane appears translucent above and opaque below the line of demarcation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67379 \">picture 4</a>). In addition, there may be purulence in the ear canal if there is an associated tympanic membrane rupture.</p><p>The predictive value and accuracy of abnormal otoscope findings have not been reported for AOM in adults but has been studied in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In one study, flawed by the lack of bacterial cultures and selective performance of myringotomy to confirm the diagnosis, the predictive value of combinations of clinical findings was estimated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75969 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The triad of bulging tympanic membrane, impaired mobility, and redness or cloudiness of the tympanic membrane predicted the diagnosis of AOM, confirmed at myringotomy, in 83 to 99 percent of cases.

Consistent results from bacteriologic studies of middle ear effusions in children and adults with AOM suggest that the choice of antimicrobial agents may be based on knowledge of the bacteriology of AOM, rather than results of cultures from adjacent sites such as the throat or nasopharynx.</p><p>Microbiologic results indicate that at least one-quarter of children have AOM due to a viral respiratory pathogen, and that some of the episodes of AOM resolve without antibacterial agents. Among children with AOM, approximately 19 percent of pneumococcal, and up to one-half of non-typable (NT) <em>H. influenzae</em> AOM cases resolve and fluid samples from the middle ear become sterile without antibacterial drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. These results prompted some European clinicians to withhold antibiotic therapy from children with ear infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The option of observation of children with AOM, rather than initial antimicrobial therapy, is practiced extensively in Western Europe.

Complications may result from seeding of vascular channels and extension along preformed pathways (such as the oval window, round window, internal auditory canal, or endolymphatic duct) and are typically divided into intratemporal or extratemporal classifications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29565569\"><span class=\"h2\">Intratemporal complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14530790\"><span class=\"h3\">Mastoiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spectrum of disease is associated with mastoiditis. Mastoid effusion is often seen on computed tomography (CT) scan in patients with acute otitis media (AOM) and is not usually clinically significant. Symptomatic mastoiditis is a rare complication of both acute and chronic otitis media but can be serious due to proximity of the mastoid to the posterior cranial fossa, lateral sinuses, facial nerve canal, semicircular canals, and the petrous tip of the temporal bone.</p><p>Acute mastoiditis occurs more commonly in children than adults, and its incidence has declined dramatically in the antibiotic era with routine use of antibiotics for treatment of otitis media. It is a rare occurrence in adults. In a study of patients with acute mastoiditis admitted to two hospitals in Sweden between 1996 and 2000, only 3 of the 42 patients were older than 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Two of the three adults had prior cranial surgery on the same side as the mastoiditis. Mastoiditis may be clinically more severe in older adults, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Clinical mastoiditis may present with fever, posterior ear pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local erythema over the mastoid bone, edema of the pinna, or a posteriorly and downward displaced auricle. In coalescent mastoiditis, CT demonstrates characteristic loss of the trabecular bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>CT scan should always be performed when mastoiditis is suspected. If there is a concern for an intracranial process (ie, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, intracranial abscess), then a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan should also be considered. Patients with acute suppurative mastoiditis should be admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics. When mastoiditis occurs as a complication of acute otitis media, antibiotics with activity against <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> should be started. When mastoiditis presents as a complication of more chronic disease, coverage should include <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, and enteric Gram-negative rods.</p><p>If patients do not respond to conservative therapy with IV antibiotics, further intervention is warranted. This involves mastoidectomy for debridement of necrotic bone. Myringotomy is an adjunct to mastoidectomy for the treatment of acute mastoiditis and allows the administration of topical antibiotic preparations.

A pathologic process that erodes the bone overlying the facial nerve, such as a cholesteatoma, can directly compress the facial nerve; this typically occurs in the tympanic or vertical mastoid segment of the nerve. Alternatively, inflammation of the facial nerve within its bony channel, the Fallopian canal, can lead to paralysis. Specifically, inflammation of the facial nerve can occur via direct spread of the infection from the middle ear through microdehiscences of the Fallopian canal; as the inflamed nerve swells within this confined bony channel, a compression injury results in the facial paralysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29565584\"><span class=\"h3\">Labyrinthitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Labyrinthitis presents as nausea, vomiting, vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in the setting of both acute and chronic ear infections. A picture of labyrinthitis in the setting of AOM may occur as a result of serous labyrinthitis, a pre-suppurative condition in which the labyrinth undergoes inflammatory changes in association with acute suppurative otitis media. Serous labyrinthitis is not associated with permanent auditory or vestibular dysfunction. Treatment is predominantly medical, unless persistent granulation tissue or cholesteatoma are present. By contrast, purulent labyrinthitis presents with intense vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, vomiting, nausea, and a picture of acute toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29565591\"><span class=\"h3\">Hearing loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of intratemporal changes can produce hearing loss in the context of both acute and chronic ear infections, though are more commonly seen in cases of chronic otitis media (COM). The hearing loss is usually conductive in nature due to ossicular erosion or tympanic membrane perforation. Sensorineural hearing loss may occur, particularly in the setting of a new infection in an adult without a prior history of ear infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29565598\"><span class=\"h3\">Petrositis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The petrous apex of the temporal bone is anatomically closely related to critical neural and vascular structures. As a result, infections of the petrous apex can result in severe neural compromise. Because of the extensive pneumatization and presence of rich bone marrow within the petrous apex, it is susceptible to infection or inflammation, typically in combination with mastoiditis. The inflammation may extend into Dorello&rsquo;s canal transmitting the VIth cranial nerve and the Gasserian ganglion, causing the triad of symptoms known as &ldquo;Gradenigo Syndrome&rdquo;: lateral rectus palsy, retro-orbital pain, and otorrhea. The presence of both otorrhea and deep pain should lead one to suspect petrous apicitis.</p><p>The most common organism responsible for petrous apicitis is <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. The acute form typically develops over a rapid period of time and is due to sudden obstruction of a normally pneumatized petrous apex air cell system. Diagnosis is affirmed by temporal bone CT, demonstrating opacification of the mastoid air cells system and petrous apex, enhancement of the cavernous sinus, and bony erosion within the petrous apex. High-resolution MRI with gadolinium through the temporal bone will demonstrate a low-intensity signal on T1-weighted images, high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images, and ring enhancement. MRI findings are important in distinguishing petrous apicitis from other lesions of the petrous apex. Treatment consists of antibiotic therapy, with surgical exploration reserved for those who do not respond to appropriate antibiotics or develop complications from the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

Treatment requires surgical drainage after identification of the abscess on MRI or CT imaging. Epidural abscesses occur most commonly secondary to erosion of the posterior fossa plate. Less commonly, erosion of the tegmen mastoideum can lead to a middle fossa epidural abscess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The presentation of a subdural abscess may closely mirror that of an epidural abscess. Neurologic signs are more likely to accompany abscesses that occur in the subdural space, between the dura and arachnoid meningeal layers. The mechanism underlying the development of a subdural abscess is thought to be bone erosion followed by thrombophlebitis.</p><p>Brain abscesses in association with chronic ear infections will typically involve the temporal lobe or cerebellum. Treatment requires drainage of the brain abscess, followed by surgical eradication of the mastoid infection. Successful management of brain abscesses typically requires a prolonged course of potent antibiotic therapy.

The typical case of otitic hydrocephalus occurs following prolonged otitis media. The most common symptom is headache on the side of the involved ear. Papilledema is noted and evidence of hydrocephalus is seen on cranial imaging by CT or MRI. The pathogenesis behind otitic hydrocephalus appears to involve abnormal cerebrospinal fluid metabolism from inflamed meninges.

The offending pathogen is usually non-typable (NT) <em>H. influenzae</em>, although <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and, to a lesser extent, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> can also be implicated. The meningitis may be local, in which case cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be negative for bacteria. Usually, however, the meningitis is generalized, and lumbar puncture with spinal fluid studies demonstrate bacteria. Otitic meningitis is the most common intracranial complication from chronic otitis and mastoiditis, although meningitis may occur in association with AOM as well. All forms of otitic meningitis typically present with the classic signs of meningitis, including fever, neck pain, photophobia, and mental status changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Septic lateral sinus thrombosis is exclusively associated with infection of the mastoid air cells. Lateral sinus thrombosis is often subacute in onset, with a persistent earache as the first symptom persisting for several weeks before the onset of headache. Anemia, increased signs of increased intracranial pressure, lower cranial neuropathies, and Griesinger&rsquo;s sign (postauricular edema from emissary vein thrombophlebitis) may result in advanced stages of the disease. Sigmoid thrombophlebitis may extend to the jugular vein, with resultant internal jugular vein thrombosis. Treatment requires drainage of the perisinus abscess via a transmastoid approach, exposure of the sigmoid sinus, and antibiotics. If there are signs of systemic embolization (eg, pulmonary embolus), anticoagulation may be indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-dural-sinus-thrombosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic dural sinus thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Septic lateral sinus thrombosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otitis media with effusion (OME) is often characterized by hearing loss or aural fullness, and possibly a history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media (AOM). There may be an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection, exacerbation in seasonal allergy symptoms, or airplane travel.</p><p>Otoscopic findings of OME are fluid (often yellowish, but sometimes clear), and visible behind a retracted tympanic membrane. A normal tympanic membrane is shown in a photograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626 \">picture 3</a>), to be compared with a retracted tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52819\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52819 \">picture 6</a>). Viscous bubbles may also be seen, particularly during pneumatic otoscopy.

Patients with symptoms of ear fullness associated with hearing loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visualization of an opaque or yellowish tympanic membrane on pneumatic otoscopy should be referred for tympanometry with audiometry. Audiometry will reveal the presence of a mild to moderate conductive hearing loss. If sensorineural hearing loss is demonstrated, particularly in the presence of normal tympanometry, immediate referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted for possible therapy with glucocorticoids and to rule out a retrocochlear lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment for otitis media with effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, OME resolves spontaneously without treatment. In a small percentage of cases, the effusion persists and requires additional intervention, such as pressure equalization tubes.</p><p>Simple maneuvers such as autoinsufflation (pinching the nose while gently exhaling, forcing air back through the eustachian tube and repressurizing the ear) may be helpful, although a systematic review of small studies of autoinsufflation in children did not demonstrate a significant difference in tympanometry results between intervention and control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Studies are not available in adults, but the maneuver is of no cost, without adverse effects, and may be helpful to some.</p><p>OME develops primarily from a <span class=\"nowrap\">mechanical/obstructive</span> phenomenon. There is no evidence that decongestants and antihistamines are beneficial in the treatment of OME in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, in adults, seasonal allergic rhinitis or nasopharyngeal swelling from an upper respiratory tract infection can induce eustachian tube dysfunction. As a result, most patients are treated with decongestants, antihistamines, or nasal steroids despite a lack of data demonstrating a clear benefit in OME. Decongestants might cause some symptom relief by alleviating nasal congestion. A majority of effusions will resolve over the course of 12 weeks, and most patients can be observed over this time period.</p><p>If the effusion does not resolve over this time period, or if there are pressing needs to provide pressure equalization or improved hearing (eg, anticipated airplane travel that cannot be deferred until OME resolves), then myringotomy with tube placement should be performed. Case series have shown myringotomy for OME to be effective with few adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-otitis-media-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]; there are no available randomized trials of myringotomy for the treatment of OME in adults.</p><p>Myringotomy is contraindicated in patients with irreversible eustachian tube dysfunction secondary to etiologies such as cancer or radiation therapy involving the eustachian tube. Placement of a tube in such patients can potentially result in chronic otorrhea.

Acute mastoiditis, inflammation of the petrous bone adjacent to the middle ear, is infrequently clinically significant but may be severe in older adults. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) occurs with a perforated tympanic membrane in the setting of chronic ear infections. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eustachian tube dysfunction, commonly related to seasonal allergic rhinitis or upper respiratory tract infection, is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of middle ear infections. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common bacteria causing AOM in both children and adults are <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> are less frequent causes. Childhood immunization with conjugate pneumococcal vaccine may affect current microbial prevalence data. Respiratory viruses have been isolated from a quarter of middle ear fluids sampled from children with AOM. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of AOM is associated with otalgia and decreased hearing. AOM is typically unilateral and drainage may be present if the tympanic membrane has ruptured. The tympanic membrane is red, opacified, bulging, and immotile, and a conductive hearing loss may be demonstrated. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that adults with AOM be managed with antibiotic treatment rather than &quot;watchful waiting&quot; (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The preferred antibacterial drug for the patient with AOM must be active against <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, non-typable (NT) <em>H. influenzae</em>, and <em>M. catarrhalis</em>. There is no evidence to support any particular antibiotic regimen versus another for treatment of AOM. Based on its acceptability and low cost, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> 500 mg three times a day for five to seven days as initial therapy for AOM in patients without penicillin allergy. A macrolide (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> combined with sulfisoxazole, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>) is the preferred drug for penicillin-allergic patients. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not respond symptomatically within 48 to 72 hours should be reexamined. Treatment regimens for patients who did not respond to the initial antibiotic course include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> or a second-generation cephalosporin. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Lack of initial response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OME is characterized by hearing loss or aural fullness and possibly a history of recurrent episodes of AOM. Otoscopy reveals fluid and an immobile retracted membrane; tympanometry is the best means of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Otitis media with effusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A majority of effusions will resolve over the course of 12 weeks, and most patients with OME can be observed over this time period. We suggest a trial of oral decongestants during this time (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients should be instructed in autoinsufflation as a low-cost intervention. Myringotomy with tympanostomy tubes may be considered for persistent symptomatic effusions at 12 weeks, and earlier for selected patients with need for immediate pressure equalization (eg, air travel that cannot be deferred). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment for otitis media with effusion'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Gates GA.
