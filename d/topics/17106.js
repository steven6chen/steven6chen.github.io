Good communication skills, while always important in clinical medicine, are especially indispensable in the context of a life-threatening illness, where fear, anxiety, existential terror, and terrible sadness can make for a challenging clinician-patient relationship. A key task for the palliative care consultant is to establish a personal connection with the patient that can not only tolerate but also integrate the affect that is typically associated with profound worries about the future and with repeatedly receiving bad news. The palliative care interview aims to collect both routine medical data and, as described below, additional personal information not regularly included in a medical history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of comprehensive patient assessment in palliative care&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This topic will focus on the initial interview that is conducted during a subspecialty palliative care consultation for an adult, which includes identifying specialized aspects of information gathering and of developing an intimate, trusting clinician-patient relationship that can address a broad range of biopsychosocial and <span class=\"nowrap\">existential/spiritual</span> issues. An overview of the domains of a comprehensive palliative care assessment and a number of related topics in medical consultation and palliative care are covered elsewhere.

While some patients and families would prefer to leave psychologically threatening domains untouched, especially death and dying, others want more attention to end of life issues, including such concerns as funerals, the likely timing of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>],<sup> </sup>and hospice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The variation in patient and family preferences around these matters is quite large, but interviewers regularly fail to accurately estimate patients&rsquo; desires for the amount and kind of information they want to receive (underestimation is most prevalent) or their preferred role in decision-making; furthermore, clinicians also tend not to review, corroborate, or correct patients&rsquo; understanding of the information delivered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Clinicians believe they have explained more to patients than audiotape recordings demonstrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], while patients report that they have many questions that are unaddressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For many clinicians, the phase of the interview devoted to explaining treatment options is more of a monologue, with little checking of understanding or solicitation of questions. Such monologues are both inefficient and ineffective. Better strategies are outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H322090694\" class=\"local\">'Patient and family education'</a> below.)</p><p>Discussions about such matters as CPR occur very late in the course of a terminal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or not at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In a 2006 study of seriously ill hospitalized patients and their family members, only one-third had discussed CPR with their clinicians and only 2 percent knew that their chance of survival following CPR was less than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Advance care planning discussions, if they occur at all, lack attention to such basic issues as patient values or prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

What is the reason for the consultation, and how does the referring clinician hope you can be helpful? Should you primarily provide one-time consultative advice to the referring clinician, or is it hoped that you will begin an ongoing role in the patient&rsquo;s care?</p><p>Data gathering at this stage begins with a thorough review of the chart and a discussion with the clinical team or teams. The primary nurse, attending physician, specialty physician(s), house officers, and social worker can all helpfully share their view of the clinical situation and what kind of help is needed. It is always important to understand and address the fundamental question(s) being posed by the primary referring clinician. If there is conflict among the treating teams or between the team and the patient or family, this should be understood and considered up front. Basic questions such as these can help to determine which members of the palliative care team should be present for the initial interview.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322090680\"><span class=\"h2\">Getting started</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial interview is not only aimed at eliciting the information required to answer the consultative question, which may include diagnosis and management of a specific <span class=\"nowrap\">condition/problem/complication,</span> but also may include some or all of the following tasks (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care#H11672056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of comprehensive patient assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Domains of palliative assessment'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developing a trusting, personal connection with the patient and family</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing a relationship that is defined by attention to both biomedical and <span class=\"nowrap\">psychosocial/spiritual</span> issues, including the emotional experience of being ill </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating the patient about the disease and its prognosis and management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understanding the needs of the family</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conveying non-abandonment, particularly when limits are being set on treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p/><p>In addition to providing an overview of the medical history from the patient&rsquo;s perspective, the opening phase of the interview should also be directed towards &ldquo;aligning with&rdquo; the patient and family, letting them know through your behaviors that you respect their perspectives, hope to understand their situation both in biomedical and psychosocial arenas, acknowledge their emotions, and seek to make a personal connection.

A brief, clear statement is recommended:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care is a medical specialty that aims to help people and their families facing a serious or life-threatening illness live as well as possible.

An expert interview is initially guided by issues that are raised by the patient and family, and flows seamlessly into key topics of concern to the consultant. </p><p>The interview begins with broad open-ended questions and active listening. As an example, &ldquo;Tell me the story of your illness.&rdquo; The clinician&rsquo;s facilitating behaviors can encourage the patient to elaborate on his or her story:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonverbal encouragement, such as that conveyed by attentive posture and head nodding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verbal encouragement to elaborate (&ldquo;OK&hellip;Uh huh&hellip;Yes&hellip;Tell me more&hellip;&rdquo;) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clarification (&ldquo;Say more about that&hellip;I am not sure I understand that&hellip;&rdquo;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not interrupting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of silence to encourage the patient to elaborate</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322090666\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient-centered interview: Content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically want to tell the story of their illness from the beginning through to the present. Listening carefully to this account with little interruption and encouraging the patient to elaborate on critical parts of the story provides the interviewer with a broad picture of the illness and an understanding of the patient&rsquo;s perspective, while conveying interest in the patient&rsquo;s experience. Clinicians are often quick to interrupt, establish their own agenda for the interview, and ask directed questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], but this undermines learning about the illness from the patient&rsquo;s perspective and also interferes with the establishment of a relationship in which the patient feels that he or she is heard and attended to.

Information sharing should be clear, simple, and jargon free, and it should build as much as possible on the patient and family&rsquo;s current understanding. It should also allow for and encourage further patient and family questions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-serious-news\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing serious news&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians tend to give explanations that are overly long and loaded with technical details and difficult concepts that can be lost on patients in these long monologues, especially when they are anxious and easily overwhelmed. In many clinical encounters, clinicians take over the treatment phase of the interview almost entirely, without checking for understanding or continued patient engagement. A better strategy for this phase of the encounter is to provide succinct, clear, jargon-free explanations and let the patient guide you to areas that they feel deserve elaboration. Repetition of key information and checking on the patient&rsquo;s understanding are often necessary. As an example, &ldquo;So now that we have talked this over, can you let me know what your understanding is about this new medication: how you take it, what it should do, and common side effects?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask-tell-ask&rdquo; is a mnemonic for &ldquo;asking&rdquo; patients about their current understanding of an issue, then crafting an explanation (&ldquo;tell&rdquo;) that is keyed to their level of knowledge and information preferences, and finally, &ldquo;asking&rdquo; the patient if he or she understands, has further questions, and can repeat the key points you communicated (&ldquo;What is your understanding now about your father&rsquo;s condition?&rdquo;)<em> </em>or answer a few basic queries about what they need to know (&ldquo;So, what do you understand now would be the value of a feeding tube?&rdquo;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102316\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102316 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Ask&ndash;tell-ask can be repeatedly used in the treatment phase of the interview to prevent it from becoming a monologue and to ensure continued patient and family engagement in the discussion and understanding of the information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. If the patient says something that the clinician doesn&rsquo;t fully understand, the clinician should say &ldquo;tell me more about&hellip;&rdquo;<em> </em>and then listen carefully and clarify until understanding is achieved. If the new information is emotionally unsettling to the patient, the clinician may need to shift the interview back and forth between emotional management skills (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F89471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89471 \">table 2</a>) and information giving.</p><p>A key task in educating the patient and family is often also providing prognostic information<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]<em> </em>(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Survival estimates in advanced terminal cancer&quot;</a>). Without at least a rough understanding of their prognosis with and without further medical treatment, seriously ill patients cannot make good choices about goals and methods for their care.</p><p>Patient and family education about prognosis may be difficult and requires a difficult balance between truthfulness or frankness and maintaining hope. A useful mantra that can help patients and families explore both sides of this equation is: &ldquo;Hope for the best, but simultaneously plan for the worst&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Serious or difficult news may be optimally delivered in the context of a family meeting, or at least with trusted family members present for an added &ldquo;set of ears&rdquo; as well as for added emotional support. Models for discussing serious news are provided in the table and discussed elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F99999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99999 \">table 3</a>).

When patient understanding or hopes seem quite unrealistic, it can be useful to employ &ldquo;wish statements&rdquo; to reframe potentially unrealistic hopes as &ldquo;wishes&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I wish that were possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I wish that I had better news to share</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I wish medicine was more powerful than it is</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I wish we had better treatments for your disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322090776\"><span class=\"h2\">Care planning: Establishing goals of care and making a recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a serious life-threatening illness often face challenging treatment choices, and high-quality discussions about what is important to them promote good decision-making and patient-centered care. Understanding the patient&rsquo;s values, preferences, and care goals in the context of an understanding of the seriousness of their disease allows the clinician to align the care provided with what is most important to the patient. Discussing goals of care is a unique skill that should be separated conceptually from talking about prognosis or delivering bad news. While discussions about goals of care may involve some of the same principles as other difficult communication tasks, these discussions demand a different framework. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Frequently when patients and families are faced with difficult management decisions, clinicians try to simply and clearly present the major pros and cons of various alternative strategies without influencing choices in one direction or another. While this approach may be well meaning, aiming to involve the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> in the decision-making process and to avoid an appearance of paternalism on the part of the clinician, patients also deserve our expertise and guidance in such situations. When the patient and family share a common understanding with the clinician about the clinical situation and the patient&rsquo;s goals, values, and preferences, the clinician can offer a recommendation for further medical management consonant with the patient&rsquo;s wishes in light of the reality of their clinical condition. Likewise, when the medical professional has a strong view of the best path under the circumstances, patients and families should not be deprived of the clinician&rsquo;s expert recommendations because of false concerns about interfering with patient autonomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. This can be initially posed as a question such as, &ldquo;Given what I know about your medical condition and about you as a person, would you like to hear what I would recommend?&rdquo; This approach is contrasted with asking the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family, &ldquo;What do you think we should do?&rdquo; which places the burden of a potentially life-or-death decision fully on them without guidance from the clinician.</p><p>Sample recommendations might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Now that we have thoroughly discussed the situation and your wishes, I recommend that we get you home with help from hospice.&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Given your desire to try anything that might help, I think it is reasonable to enroll in this experimental protocol.

The clinician should search for common ground with the patient and family that integrates the patient&rsquo;s values in light of the realities posed by their disease.</p><p>The principle of patient autonomy, and other ethical issues that arise in the palliative care setting are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important point to recognize throughout the interview, and especially in the recommendation phase, is that a focus on palliative care is not &ldquo;giving up&rdquo; and does not exclude the simultaneous provision of the full range of other disease-directed treatment modalities. At the same time, the clinician should recommend against treatments that have little or no chance of providing benefit and are very likely to cause harm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Medically futile and potentially inappropriate therapies of questionable benefit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-responding-to-requests-for-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Having the patient and family evaluated by other key members of the palliative care team (eg, depending on circumstances, this might include other physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, social workers, chaplains, pharmacists, the primary care team, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> others) is recommended both for information gathering and for clinical management. The routine interdisciplinary palliative care conference about each patient, which includes both clinicians who have had direct contact with the patient and family and those who can simply share their expertise, also provides a rich review of the case and an opportunity for input on a wide variety of topics. If patient requests for treatment are very challenging to respond to (eg, requests for near futile medical treatment or requests for active assistance in dying), the multidisciplinary team meeting is an excellent setting for clinicians to begin to explore how to evaluate and potentially respond to such requests while receiving support from colleagues. A formal ethics consultation may also be helpful in challenging cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Medically futile and potentially inappropriate therapies of questionable benefit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-responding-to-requests-for-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physician-assisted dying: Understanding, evaluating, and responding to requests for medical aid in dying&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based upon a mutual understanding of the medical situation and the patient&rsquo;s values, goals, and preferences, the clinician can also make recommendations on how to approach some of the challenges that may quite predictably occur down the road [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-initial-interview-in-palliative-care-consultation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This may lead to assigning and educating a health care agent or surrogate, or preparation of either a formal advance care directive or medical orders about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation, comfort care, or other invasive procedures (eg, dialysis, artificial hydration and nutrition), as well as transfer to home, hospice, or other medical facilities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F90150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90150 \">table 6</a>).

Patients and families are facing regular losses as they face serous, potentially fatal illness, and the clinician-patient relationship should not occasion another loss. One of the most important outcomes of a palliative care consultation in the hospital is to make sure that there is a central clinical decision maker both in the hospital and upon discharge. </p><p>The consulting palliative care clinician should make clear what kind of follow-up will be provided and who among the many treating teams will be both available and responsible for care decisions when the patient leaves the hospital.

It might be the treating specialists, the primary care clinician, or the palliative care specialist, but it is important to be very clear about who it will be and to make sure that a qualified person or well-coordinated team is willing to take on this task. Additionally, there is a formal requirement to identify a primary treating clinician if the patient is transitioning to hospice.
