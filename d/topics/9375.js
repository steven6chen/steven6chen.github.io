Infants have an innate ability to self-regulate energy intake (eg, they consume larger portions when they are fed less frequently; they consume smaller portions of energy-dense foods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-solid-foods-and-vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation-during-infancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Adequate intake of human milk or commercial infant formula meets the nutritional requirements for infants in the first six months of life.

By the end of the first year of life, most healthy infants obtain approximately one-half of their energy needs from complementary foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-solid-foods-and-vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation-during-infancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO INITIATE COMPLEMENTARY FOODS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Optimal timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon physiologic needs and neurodevelopmental maturation, complementary foods are optimally introduced between four and six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-solid-foods-and-vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation-during-infancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although age is generally a good predictor of readiness to eat solid foods, the use of age as the sole predictor may overlook the needs of the individual infant, particularly the infant who was born prematurely. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Developmental skills'</a> below.)</p><p>By four months of age, most infants have doubled their birth weight. By six months of age, complementary foods become necessary to support growth, satisfy hunger, and supplement energy and nutrient needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-solid-foods-and-vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation-during-infancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After six months of age, the volume of human milk ingested by exclusively breastfed infants generally becomes insufficient to meet the infant's requirements for energy, protein, iron, zinc, and some fat-soluble vitamins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-solid-foods-and-vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation-during-infancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In a systematic review of controlled trials and observational studies (from both developed and developing countries) infants who were exclusively breastfed for six months had growth that was comparable to that in infants who received complementary foods beginning at four months, but had fewer gastrointestinal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introducing-solid-foods-and-vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation-during-infancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Infants have an innate ability to self-regulate energy intake that may be affected by factors that diminish hunger-driven eating behavior. Requirements for selected nutrients for infants are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62525 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Infant nutritional requirements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate intake of human milk or commercial infant formula meets the nutritional requirements for infants in the first six months of life. By the end of the first year of life, most healthy infants obtain approximately one-half of their energy needs from complementary foods. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Human milk and infant formula'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Complementary foods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that complementary foods be introduced between four and six months of age if the infant is able to sit with support and has good head and neck control (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate complementary foods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complementary foods should be used in combination with human milk or commercial infant formula to provide the full range of nutrients needed for infant growth, development, and health (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62525 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70327\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70327 \">table 2</a>). Complementary foods should be offered using a spoon or infant feeder; they should not be added to a bottle unless medically necessary (eg, for gastroesophageal reflux). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'What to feed'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-ingredient foods should be introduced first. We suggest that infant cereals and pur&eacute;ed meats be offered initially (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Once these foods are accepted, pur&eacute;ed fruits and vegetables may be added. At least one feeding per day should contain foods rich in vitamin C. The addition of sugar and salt to complementary foods is discouraged. Honey and foods that may lead to choking should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'What to feed'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruit juice (including 100-percent fruit juice) generally should not be offered to infants younger than 12 months. For infants between 6 and 12 months, we suggest consumption of mashed or pur&eacute;ed whole fruit rather than 100-percent fruit juice unless the juice is medically necessary (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H547113410\" class=\"local\">'Beverages to avoid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When fruit juice is medically indicated, infants should consume pasteurized 100-percent fruit juice rather than &quot;fruit drinks,&quot; which contain added sweeteners and flavors. The juice should be offered from a cup rather than a bottle when age appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H547113410\" class=\"local\">'Beverages to avoid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants should be permitted to stop eating when they indicate that they are full (eg, by leaning back or turning away). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'How much to feed'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complexity and texture of complementary foods are advanced in parallel with the development of feeding skills. Combination foods can be given after the infant tolerates the individual components. The texture of foods is advanced initially from thin to thick pur&eacute;es. By approximately eight months of age, infants can usually chew and swallow more solid foods (eg, cooked pasta, vegetables). Between 8 and 10 months of age, infants usually can begin to eat finger foods. By 9 to 12 months of age, most infants can feed themselves, but they require a combination of dependent and independent feeding to satisfy energy and nutrient needs. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'How to advance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfed infants require some form of iron supplementation (iron-fortified infant cereal, pur&eacute;ed meats, iron-rich vegetables, liquid iron supplements) beginning at four months of age to meet their iron requirement (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day). Infants who receive iron-fortified formula do not require additional iron supplementation.
