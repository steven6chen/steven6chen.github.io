(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832453\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of concussions in children and adolescents is based upon observational studies in high school and college athletes, clinical experience, and consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Limited evidence is available for the management of concussions in children under 12 years of age and in patients who sustain concussion by mechanisms other than sports. Although this topic focuses on sport-related concussions, the principles of management are the same for children and adolescents who sustain concussions from blunt head injury by other mechanisms.</p><p>This discussion assumes that the clinician has made a firm diagnosis of concussion and that serious injury has been excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H26279353\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H11191478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>However, some concussions are dramatic, resulting in loss of consciousness, convulsions, gross imbalance, or other obvious signs of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In such cases, clinicians should immediately immobilize the cervical spine, assess for emergent conditions and other coexisting injuries, and treat according to the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H19941684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Acute or emergency department assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury&quot;, section on 'Blunt trauma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832459\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In young athletes and those with concussions from other mechanisms (eg, motor vehicle collision or fall), initial management focuses on avoidance of additional head injury through removal from competition (if applicable), restriction of physical activity, and neurocognitive rest. (See <a href=\"#H2832453\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p>Cognitive and physical rest are the primary interventions for concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/3-6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,9-11</a>]. The timing for return to school and return to competition vary from patient to patient depending upon their individual clinical course. Some students who become asymptomatic can return to school immediately.</p><p>Anticipatory guidance with education of the patient and parents or legal guardians regarding concussion, including the signs and symptoms, effects on cognition, and typical duration of recovery is also an integral component of clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because concussion may have no outward sign of injury, friends, teammates, teachers, coaches, and family members may not feel the diagnosis is legitimate and may pressure athletes into excessive physical and cognitive exertion. Education regarding concussion helps to mitigate this stress and to improve compliance with follow-up. As an example, in a multicenter observational study of 354 children (mean age 11 years) undergoing evaluation for concussion in pediatric emergency departments, provision of specific and detailed concussion discharge instructions significantly improved patient follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Although small observational studies suggest that athletes suffering from concussions who engage in very high levels of cognitive and physical activity have longer recovery times than those who engaged in low to moderate levels of activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>], care should be taken to prevent physical deconditioning and social isolation in patients with atypical recovery and prolonged symptoms. Those same studies suggest that low levels of activity are <strong>not</strong> harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832471\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevent additional injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expert consensus indicates that any child or adolescent with a suspected sport-related concussion should be removed from further competition that day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/3,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6</a>]. The athlete should undergo additional evaluation with a licensed practitioner to determine if a concussion has occurred. If a concussion is diagnosed, the athlete should <strong>not</strong> return to play until a full recovery is evident. (See <a href=\"#H2832525\" class=\"local\">'Return to play (RTP)'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to removal from organized athletic activities, children and adolescents recovering from concussions should also avoid any recreational activities that may result in a second head injury (eg, cycling, skateboarding, ice skating, or climbing) until they are cleared for competition.</p><p>During recovery, athletes suffering from concussions may be particularly vulnerable to worsening symptoms, additional concussions, or potential catastrophic outcomes, such as second impact syndrome if repeated injury occurs. Animal models and observational studies in humans suggest that these additional injuries may occur even with relatively low energy collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/14-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-20</a>].</p><p>Similarly, patients with concussions caused by other mechanisms should avoid all activities that would place them at risk for additional blunt head trauma during their recovery.</p><p>This window of increased brain vulnerability and danger of potentially catastrophic head injury has also been demonstrated in observational human studies and animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/15-18,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18,21,22</a>]. As an example, in a case series of 94 incidents of severe head injury while playing American football, 42 percent of athletes had sustained a previous head injury during the same season and almost 40 percent were playing with residual neurologic symptoms at the time of severe head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The incidence of injury was significantly higher among high school athletes when compared with college athletes (risk ratio 3.3), and 9 percent of all athletes died. In an observational study of traumatic brain and spinal cord fatalities in high school and college American football players over 10 years, 4 of 22 high school players who died had a history of concussion within the previous four weeks and second impact syndrome was the cause of death in 3 of these 4 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, although rare, serious head injury and death may be associated with continued competition too soon after mild head injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832477\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical rest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that young athletes with sport-related concussion and children and adolescents with concussions from other causes adhere to a brief period of physical rest lasting 24 to 48 hours followed by a gradual and progressive return to non-contact, non-risk physical activity designed to avoid symptom exacerbation rather than strict physical rest until symptoms resolve. If symptoms are worsened by light physical activity, then further activity should be deferred until it can be initiated without worsening of symptoms. In general, a rapid return to vigorous exertion is likely to exacerbate symptoms and, for most children, should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2832525\" class=\"local\">'Return to play (RTP)'</a> below.)</p><p>While they are recovering from concussion, athletes should also be restricted from collisions and activities where they may sustain blunt head injury (eg, contact sports, skiing, skating, or cycling). Incomplete recovery may make the athlete more vulnerable to worsening of symptoms or for more catastrophic head injuries in the event of recurrent collisions (ie, second impact syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H2832471\" class=\"local\">'Prevent additional injury'</a> above.)</p><p>A growing body of evidence is showing decreased concussion symptom scores and duration of symptoms with some physical activity earlier in the course of recovery, and no negative effects of aerobic physical activity with a low-risk for head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. As an example, in a prospective, multicenter cohort study of over 2400 children, 5 to 18 years of age, who were diagnosed with an acute concussion during an emergency department visit, physical activity within seven days of injury (70 percent of patients) was associated with a significantly reduced risk of persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS) at 28 days when compared to full physical rest (25 versus 44 percent on unadjusted analysis, 29 versus 40 percent on matched propensity analysis of 1108 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. On sensitivity analysis that accounted for symptom burden at seven days after injury, the risk of PPCS at 28 days was not significantly different between the groups. Thus, the difference in PPCS at 28 days may be the result of confounding and clinical trials are needed to confirm this result. Nevertheless, this study supports early return to light physical activity as tolerated in children with acute concussion. </p><p>Further studies are needed to identify the efficacy of this approach and the degree and duration of rest that is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832483\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive rest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to mental activity in children and adolescents with concussion is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptoms worsened by cognitive effort</strong> &ndash; We suggest that patients who have sustained a concussion, are symptomatic, and have worsening of symptoms by activities such as reading, video games, or screen time avoid all mental activity that makes them feel worse, up to and including absence from school. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/6,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29</a>]. Social visits both in and out of the home and trips should be limited. During this period of reasonable rest, the child may often engage in light mental activities, such as watching limited amounts of television and family interaction, without exacerbating symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, close follow-up with a pediatrician, sports medicine specialist, or other capable provider is needed to help guide the liberalization of mental activity. Patients can return to school as soon as they can tolerate 30 to 45 minutes of concentration. In our experience, concussed patients typically require one to two days of reasonable rest before returning to school. To avoid the harm of prolonged absence from school, we usually return student athletes to school after a maximum of five days of rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asymptomatic or low-level symptoms</strong> &ndash; We suggest that patients who are asymptomatic or have low-level symptoms not worsened by routine mental activities receive anticipatory guidance that emphasizes avoidance of cognitive effort that cause a resumption or worsening of symptoms. In our experience, exposure to video games, loud music, prolonged screen time, or mental activities requiring high levels of focus and concentration (eg, taking standardized tests) are activities that frequently induce symptoms and need to be curtailed for a few days after injury. These patients may continue to attend school.</p><p/><p>All children and adolescents returning to school after a concussion warrant monitoring of symptoms and academic adjustments (eg, rest break in the nurse's office or reduced class time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91450 \">table 1</a>)), as needed, if symptoms are exacerbated by schoolwork or the school environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H785622\" class=\"local\">'Return to learn'</a> below.)</p><p>Cognitive rest is designed to avoid overtaxing a functionally injured brain and to prevent metabolic overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/6,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29,30</a>]. The recommendation for cognitive rest after a concussion is based upon expert consensus, clinical experience, and the following observational evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective observational study of 335 athletes (age 8 to 23 years) with delayed recovery (mean duration of symptoms 43 days) and undergoing treatment by pediatric sports medicine specialists, those patients with the highest degree of cognitive activity after a concussion took the longest time to recover as determined by a cognitive activity scale that was not validated. However, light to moderate cognitive demand was not associated with prolongation of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small observational studies show that cognitive &quot;overexertion&quot; is frequently associated with worsening symptoms and that the risk for overexertion, as measured by neurocognitive tests, persists for some time after injury. As an example, in 72 students who sustained concussions, 80 percent reported increased symptoms of concussion after cognitive exertion one month after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a separate study of 20 concussed athletes who were matched to 20 control athletes, measures of executive function were disrupted in the concussed athletes relative to controls for two weeks to two months after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one small observational study of 49 high school and college athletes who were prescribed at least one week of cognitive and physical rest from 1 to 30 days after a concussion, cognitive and physical rest was associated with significantly improved neurocognitive function based upon a standardized assessment tool or neuropsychological testing and a decrease in concussion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Improvement was seen regardless of the time between injury and the institution of rest.</p><p/><p>On the other hand, the proper degree of cognitive rest and the optimal duration varies from patient to patient. Some experts have noted that prolonged rest with absence from school may be harmful in children and adolescents with concussions, especially in patients with lengthy recoveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Limited evidence also indicates a potential for worsening symptoms in patients with varying degrees of concussion, who are prescribed overly restrictive rest. As an example, in a trial of 99 patients aged 11 to 22 years who were diagnosed with a concussion after pediatric emergency department evaluation (36 percent with loss of consciousness), all subjects reduced physical activity and one group was assigned to strict cognitive rest for five days while the other was assigned to usual care (one to two days of rest followed by gradual return to full cognitive activities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/25,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33</a>]. Longer cognitive rest was associated with significantly more daily postconcussive symptoms during the 10 days of follow-up compared with usual care. Strict rest for five days was also associated with an increased duration of symptoms relative to usual care which was not significant (median of seven versus four days respectively, p = 0.08). There was no clinically significant difference in neurocognitive and balance outcomes at 3 and 10 days after injury as measured by computerized neurocognitive testing or the balance error scoring system (BESS).</p><p>Taken together, the available evidence suggests that avoidance of mental activities that worsen symptoms in concussed patients followed by a gradual resumption of these activities with close patient reassessment by a clinician with expertise in managing pediatric concussions is most likely to result in the shortest duration of symptoms and most timely return to full cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832489\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptom management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric patients may experience a variety of symptoms while recovering from concussions. In most instances, adherence to physical and cognitive rest will improve symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/5,6,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,35</a>]. Although briefly prescribed medications for symptomatic treatment may be helpful, clinicians should avoid relying too heavily upon pharmaceutical therapies. Under no circumstance, should medications be used to mask symptoms with the goal of permitting an athlete to compete. In addition, athletes should not return to play until they are symptom-free while off medications that are prescribed to treat concussion. (See <a href=\"#H6127367\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832495\"><span class=\"h4\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache is the most common symptom following a concussion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H26279353\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>). Recurrent headaches are also an important marker for physical or cognitive overexertion during recovery. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>) are reasonable adjuncts to physical and cognitive rest during the first few days after injury, they may be ineffective and rebound headaches can complicate treatment and recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/5,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,36-39</a>]. Therefore, their prolonged or frequent use beyond the first few days after injury should be discouraged.</p><p>Patients with a prior history of migraine headaches may develop a migraine that is triggered by a minor head injury. Initiation of abortive therapy is appropriate if the headache is typical of prior migraine episodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in children&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with prolonged headache, the clinician should ensure that there is not a cervicogenic component. Patients with cervicogenic headaches warrant referral for physical therapy and the headache should <strong>not</strong> be a justification for absence from school. However, these patients should <strong>not </strong>return to play until the headache resolves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H8941574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Primary headache'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832501\"><span class=\"h4\">Nausea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Ondansetron</a> is a reasonable therapy for nausea for the first one to two days after a concussion, especially if it is interfering with eating or drinking. However, ondansetron can cause headaches, drowsiness, and dizziness that may exacerbate other symptoms of concussion. Thus, caregivers should be instructed to stop ondansetron if it makes their child feel worse.</p><p>Phenothiazine antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metoclopramide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">promethazine</a>) should be <strong>avoided</strong> in children and adolescents due to the potential adverse effects of drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, and in younger patients, acute dystonic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2832507\"><span class=\"h4\">Sleep disturbance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents with concussion frequently have signs of sleep disturbance including daytime drowsiness, difficulty falling asleep, and difficulty staying asleep. Emphasis on proper sleep hygiene provides the best initial treatment for these patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52760 \">table 2</a>). However, physical rest precludes exercise as a component of sleep hygiene for concussed patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;, section on 'Older children and adolescents'</a>.)</p><p>Sleep may also be difficult due to symptoms of headache or dizziness. Thus, control of these symptoms may improve sleep as well.</p><p>For most patients, sleep will improve with proper sleep hygiene. If pharmacotherapy is necessary because sleep disturbance is prolonging recovery and sleep hygiene has not resulted in improved sleep, then we typically prescribe a trial of melatonin (up to 3 mg in older children and 5 mg in adolescents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/5,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,40</a>]. The lack of side effects or significant toxicity makes melatonin an attractive choice although efficacy in the setting of concussion is not established. Melatonin is not subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) controls. Thus, preparations may vary in potency and purity.</p><p>If melatonin is not effective, then consultation with a pediatric sleep specialist, pediatric neurologist, or pediatric psychiatrist to identify other therapeutic options is warranted.</p><p>Benzodiazepines should be avoided in patients with concussion because of day time sleepiness and memory impairment which hampers the assessment of recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Trazodone</a>, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and antagonist at alpha adrenergic and serotonergic receptors, has been employed with some success for sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury in adults, but experience in children is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

As opposed to academic adjustments, academic accommodations are designed to provide a specific individualized education plan for student instruction that will address specifically identified learning deficits based upon professional (eg, psychological or neuropsychological) testing.

Each has advantages and disadvantages. Traditional neuropsychological testing is more thorough and can be tailored to meet the needs of each patient. Interpretation by a neuropsychologist permits the assessment of other potential factors that may be affecting test performance. Furthermore, assessment by a neuropsychologist has the added advantage of an additional clinical opinion.</p><p>However, pen-and-paper testing typically takes several hours. Also, many patients may not have access to a neuropsychologist. In addition, pen-and-paper testing is relatively costly and health insurance may not cover the cost of testing. Thus, traditional neuropsychological testing is often not a practical approach to measuring and managing cognitive recovery in concussed children and adolescents.</p><p>Computerized neurocognitive assessments are convenient (administration time approximately 30 minutes) and permit tests to be administered by other medical personnel after test specific training has been completed.

If baseline assessments are unavailable, age-adjusted normative data are available and can be useful in attempting to estimate premorbid levels of functioning for a given athlete. Given the variability in performance between athletes, however, baseline data are ideal.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Concussion in Sport Group consensus statement, children and adolescents should remain at each stage of rehabilitation no less than 24 hours before advancing to the next level. Thus, a <strong>minimum</strong> of five days should pass before consideration of full return to competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have legislation requiring a minimum number of symptom-free days prior to returning to play. The clinician should be aware of any such laws or local recommendations.</p><p>If there is return of symptoms at any level, the athlete should rest until the symptoms resolve, and then attempt the protocol again beginning at the previous level of symptom-free exertion.</p><p>Because of the concern for complications and permanent brain injury that are associated with overly aggressive return to play in children and adolescents, we have athletes younger than 13 years of age and those at higher risk (eg, longer duration of symptoms, higher numbers of previous concussions, or returning to higher risk sports) engage in a longer symptom-free waiting period before returning to play. For instance, a 12 year-old athlete recovering from a second lifetime concussion, with symptoms that took longer than four weeks to resolve should consider one week of success at each of the stages of exercise progression before returning to a high risk sport, such as American football or ice hockey. Some clinicians have advocated a requirement of equal number of symptom-free weeks as there were symptomatic weeks during recovery before return to contact practice and play is considered.</p><p>Thus, the plan for RTP after a concussion should be individualized, gradual, and progressive. This progression permits the athlete to restore confidence, sharpen skills, and simulate sports-specific activity in a controlled setting before entering competitive play. The final decision for RTP should be made by a licensed clinical provider with experience in the evaluation and management of sports-related concussions. The prognosis for RTP cannot be easily predicted by the presenting features of a concussion. Full RTP exercise progression may take days, weeks, or months although most athletes will be cleared to play within one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

According to the Institute of Medicine's report on &quot;Sports-related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing the Culture,&quot; preliminary evidence supports concussion education programs, age limits on body-checking (ice hockey) or tackling (American football), and proper enforcement of rules and fair play among young athletes as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Education</strong> &ndash; Studies in young athletes and youth coaches indicate that educational programs are associated with increased attainment of knowledge about the recognition and seriousness of concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. However, change in behavior has not been well studied and persistent tendencies among high school athletes to potentially hide symptoms so as not to appear weak or let the team down have been reported. For example, in a survey of 167 high school athletes, 60 percent of concussions events were <strong>not</strong> disclosed to an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Similarly, less than half of 229 high school American football players who had a concussion during the previous season reported the injury to a trainer, physician, or coach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Furthermore, in a prospective observational study approximately 40 percent of 59 elite female soccer players played despite symptoms of concussion and 56 percent never saw a qualified health professional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of reporting a concussion included approval of such reporting by peers, coaches, and parents; a positive view of reporting by the individual, and ease of reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anticipatory guidance by the primary care physician is another method of education for the student athlete and parents.

In a follow-up to this study, once checking was permitted at the ages of 13 and 14 years for both Canadian provinces, concussion rates did not differ significantly between the groups, but players introduced to body checking for the first time at that age had a significantly higher risk of injuries resulting in seven days or more time loss from hockey compared to players who had at least two years of previous body checking experience (2.2 versus 1.5 injuries per 1,000 player-hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further investigation is needed to determine if the higher observed risk of other injuries can be mitigated by interventions such as on and off ice exercises designed to teach younger players how to absorb a body check without being injured during seasons when checking is not permitted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence is lacking concerning whether restrictions on tackling in American football can reduce concussions. In a preliminary study that compared the incidence of injury between tackle football and flag football leagues, the incidence of severe injuries or concussions was <strong>not</strong> significantly different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Total injuries were more frequent in flag football leagues, but tackle football injuries resulted in a significantly longer time before return to play. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fair play</strong> &ndash; Observational studies of youth and high school sports show that adherence to the rules of the sport and encouragement of fair play is associated with decreased injuries, including concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. For example, greater accelerations of the head and many concussions in sports occur during illegal play, when athletes do not anticipate the collision, or when athletes use improper technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>]. Thus, proper coaching technique and adherence to the rules of play may reduce the overall incidence of concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>].</p><p/><p>By contrast, existing evidence does not support the ability for equipment, such as helmets or mouth guards to prevent concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Furthermore, injury risk rating systems provided by equipment manufacturers have not been shown to correlate with actual concussion risk. Although new devices are available that can noninvasively monitor the number and magnitude of head impacts, further study is needed to determine if this information can identify players that should be removed from competition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>However, the associated reduction of catastrophic brain injuries for athletes who wear helmets and of dental or facial injuries for athletes who wear mouth guards or facial protection warrant their continued promotion. Similar evidence also supports the use of helmets when performing high risk activities outside of organized sports (eg, climbing, riding bicycles or motorcycles, or skiing) and the use of seat belts or appropriate car seats to protect children and adolescents during motor vehicle collisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children&quot;, section on 'Mouthguards'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicycle injuries in children: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Bicycle helmet use'</a>.)</p><p>In theory, strengthening of the muscles of the neck and posterior shoulders might reduce the risk of sports-related concussion by reducing acceleration during direct or indirect head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/91,95-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,95-97</a>]. However, no studies have documented benefit from this approach and recommending neck strengthening exercises may be counterproductive because young athletes may believe they are protected against concussion by doing these exercises and may engage in dangerous play.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2860610477\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of legislation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laws designed to encourage identification of concussion and to prevent concussed youth athletes from continuing play exist in all 50 of the United States. These laws, modeled after the Zackery Lystedt Law, which was named after a 13-year-old middle school boy who suffered permanent brain injury when he continued to play in a football game despite having a concussion and was enacted in Washington State in 2009, consist of three components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mandatory removal of athletes with confirmed or suspected concussion from play </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance from a licensed health professional before athletes may return to play</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Annual education of coaches, parents, and athletes on the signs and symptoms of concussion </p><p/><p>Adoption of these laws has been associated with a decrease in the incidence of recurrent concussions among US high school athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-management/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Passage of this legislation has also been associated with increased reporting of new concussions from the prelaw through the post law period, likely attributable to increased awareness and identification of concussions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1155262648\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The athlete should undergo further evaluation with a licensed practitioner to determine if a concussion has occurred. If a concussion is diagnosed, the athlete should <strong>not</strong> return to play until a full recovery is evident. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to removal from organized athletic activities, children and adolescents recovering from concussions should also avoid any recreational activities that may result in a second head injury (eg, cycling, skateboarding, ice skating, or climbing) until they are cleared for competition. Similarly, patients with concussions caused by other mechanisms should avoid all activities that would place them at risk for additional blunt head trauma during their recovery. (See <a href=\"#H2832471\" class=\"local\">'Prevent additional injury'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sideline-evaluation-of-concussion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sideline evaluation of concussion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that young athletes with sport-related concussion and children and adolescents with concussions from other causes adhere to a brief period of physical rest lasting 24 to 48 hours followed by a gradual and progressive return to non-contact, non-risk physical activity designed to avoid symptom exacerbation rather than strict physical rest until all symptoms have resolved (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2832477\" class=\"local\">'Physical rest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who have sustained a concussion, are symptomatic, and have worsening of symptoms by activities such as reading, video games, or screen time avoid all mental activity that makes them feel worse, up to and including absence from school (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Social visits both in and out of the home and trips should be limited. During this period of reasonable rest, the child may often engage in light mental activities, such as watching limited amounts of television and family interaction, without exacerbating symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2832483\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive rest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In symptomatic patients, close follow-up with a pediatrician, sports medicine specialist, or other capable provider is needed to help guide the liberalization of mental activity. Patients can return to school as soon as they can tolerate 30 to 45 minutes of concentration. In our experience, concussed patients typically require one to two days of reasonable rest before returning to school. To avoid the harm of prolonged absence from school, we usually return student athletes to school after a maximum of five days of cognitive rest. (See <a href=\"#H2832483\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive rest'</a> above and <a href=\"#H785622\" class=\"local\">'Return to learn'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who are asymptomatic or have low-level symptoms <strong>not</strong> worsened by routine mental activities receive anticipatory guidance that emphasizes avoidance of cognitive effort that cause a resumption or worsening of symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In our experience, exposure to video games, loud music, prolonged screen time, or mental activities requiring high levels of focus and concentration (eg, taking standardized tests) are activities that frequently induce symptoms and need to be curtailed for a few days after injury. These patients may continue to attend school. (See <a href=\"#H2832483\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive rest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All children and adolescents returning to school after a concussion warrant monitoring of symptoms and academic adjustments (eg, rest break in the nurse's office or reduced class time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91450 \">table 1</a>)), as needed, if symptoms are exacerbated by schoolwork or the school environment. (See <a href=\"#H785622\" class=\"local\">'Return to learn'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adolescents may experience a variety of symptoms while recovering from concussion. In most instances, adherence to physical and cognitive rest will improve symptoms. Although briefly prescribed medications for symptomatic treatment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> for headache) may be helpful, clinicians should avoid prolonged use of pharmaceutical therapies. Under no circumstance, should medications be used to mask symptoms with the goal of permitting an athlete to compete. (See <a href=\"#H2832489\" class=\"local\">'Symptom management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that young athletes fully complete the consensus graduated return to play (RTP) protocol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61318 \">table 3</a>) after an individualized period of cognitive and physical rest before clearance for competition (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The following are requirements for children and adolescents to begin the RTP protocol (see <a href=\"#H2832525\" class=\"local\">'Return to play (RTP)'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Successful return to school</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptom-free and off any medications prescribed to treat the concussion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Normal neurologic examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Back at baseline balance and cognitive performance measures. If baseline assessments are unavailable, age-adjusted normative data are available and can be useful in attempting to estimate premorbid levels of functioning for a given athlete. Given the variability in performance between athletes, however, baseline data are ideal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H786132\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Concussion in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Preparticipation assessments'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because cognitive recovery may lag behind physical recovery, neuropsychological testing can also be helpful in determining when the patient has fully recovered from a concussion. (See <a href=\"#H785743\" class=\"local\">'Neuropsychological testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening of the patient's symptoms despite appropriately following a regimen of physical and cognitive rest should prompt the clinician to evaluate for other potential diagnoses and, if serious intracranial injury cannot be excluded, neuroimaging.
