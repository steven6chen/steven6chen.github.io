The term &quot;septic arthritis&quot; usually refers to bacterial arthritis or fungal arthritis, but bacterial joint infections are most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of bacterial arthritis in infants and children will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, treatment, and outcome of bacterial arthritis in infants and children are discussed separately.

Patients with bacterial arthritis of the hip may complain of knee pain. Those with bacterial arthritis of the sacroiliac joint may have symptoms that mimic appendicitis, pelvic neoplasm, or urinary tract infection. Arthritis of the sacroiliac joint usually occurs in late childhood (average age of 10 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Underlying arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial arthritis should be considered as a possibility in children and adolescents with underlying juvenile idiopathic arthritis (formerly juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) if there is unusual worsening of one joint during an exacerbation of arthritis or there has been a recent injection of the joint in question.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20423761\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of infants and children with suspected bacterial arthritis should occur promptly. Diagnostic joint aspiration should be performed as soon as possible so that surgical drainage (if necessary) and appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy can be instituted. Early diagnosis and treatment is associated with improved outcome. It is difficult to provide a threshold for the &quot;critical window&quot; of time for joint drainage and initiation of antibiotics. However, case series consistently suggest that joint injury is more likely when joint drainage and initiation of antibiotics are performed four or more days after the onset of symptoms, particularly in children with septic arthritis of the hip.

The pain may awaken the patient at night, in contrast to the pain of inflammatory arthropathies such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in which symptoms tend to be worst upon rising in the morning. Complaints of knee or thigh pain may represent referred pain from pathology in the hip (bacterial arthritis or other hip pathology).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint trauma &ndash; Joint trauma may provide an entry point for direct inoculation (eg, animal bites, kneeling on needles, puncture wounds, or lacerations over a joint), which may be associated with unusual pathogens (eg, <em>Pasteurella</em>, anaerobes, sporotrichosis), in contrast to the typical pathogens that usually enter the joint from the bloodstream.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin lesions &ndash; Skin lesions may occur in bacterial arthritis due to <em>N. gonorrhoeae </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69978 \">picture 2</a>) or <em>N. meningitidis </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52107\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52107 \">picture 3</a>)<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

It also may provide a clue to an antecedent infection that may be associated with postinfectious arthritis (eg, poststreptococcal reactive arthritis) or predispose to infection with a resistant pathogen (eg, penicillin-resistant pneumococcus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Serum sickness-like reactions also may follow exposure to many antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ciprofloxacin</a>, and sulfonamides.

Enteric, genitourinary, and respiratory infections may precede postinfectious reactive arthritis. Concurrent varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection may provide a portal of entry for <em>S. aureus</em> or group A streptococcal bacteremia; VZV itself also can rarely cause arthritis.

Infants and children with bacterial arthritis usually appear ill. They tend to maintain the joint in a position that maximizes comfort. Knees are held moderately flexed. Hips are flexed, abducted, and externally rotated in an attempt to maintain the position causing the least pain from stretching the joint capsule. Position preference to maximize comfort is a nonspecific finding; it may occur in any condition with increased intra-articular fluid (eg, hemarthrosis from hemophilia, sterile effusion, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15,24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,31</a>].

In a retrospective case series of 133 children with osteoarticular brucellosis, 74 percent had associated hepatomegaly. In smaller case series, the frequency of hepatomegaly ranged from 17 to 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Finding several abnormal joints makes bacterial arthritis less likely than viral, reactive, or inflammatory arthropathies, which are more commonly polyarticular. If the child is frightened or uncooperative, the parent can be instructed to perform the joint examination while the clinician observes from a distance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The involved joint is typically swollen, red, warm, and tender to palpation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88934%7EPEDS%2F89224\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88934 graphicRef89224 \">picture 1A-B</a>). External findings may be absent when the hip is involved, although asymmetric buttock creases or swelling of a buttock or the genitalia may provide a clue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Severe swelling may indicate extensive infection or venous thrombosis (sometimes associated with <em>S. aureus</em> osteoarticular infections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19,26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26,34</a>]. Changes in the adjacent soft tissue are variable and depend upon the duration of infection and the depth of the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Pain through any range of active or passive motion is suggestive of bacterial arthritis.
