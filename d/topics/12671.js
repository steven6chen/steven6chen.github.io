This staging system is important in determining not only prognosis and treatment, but is also important for the comparison of results obtained with different types of treatment in different studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will provide a brief review of the selection of treatment based upon disease stage. The initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with HL are discussed separately, as is a more detailed description of treatment selection for patients with early or advanced stage HL.

While the majority of patients will be cured of their lymphoma, treatment-related toxicities have become a competing cause of late mortality. As such, the selection of therapy must balance the desire to maintain a high rate of cure and the need to minimize long-term complications. Treatment has evolved such that patients with early stage disease can achieve long term remission with less intensive therapy, while more intensive therapy is reserved for patients with advanced stage disease. Despite agreement that therapy should be tailored to the stage of disease, there is some disagreement regarding what should constitute intensive and less intensive therapy.</p><p>The endpoint of many clinical trials is freedom from recurrence. Although in many studies an increased relapse risk in one treatment arm does not translate into a survival difference, survival differences are often seen in the following situations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large difference in number of recurrences seen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very long follow-up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies with large numbers of patients (eg, Cochrane analysis)</p><p/><p>This suggests that in many of the trials where a difference in recurrence is seen, the number of patients or the length of follow-up is inadequate to see a survival difference. In addition, when recurrences are seen, the potential toxicity of treatment is much greater than that seen with initial therapy.</p><p>The successful management of patients with HL requires close attention to details of the staging and treatment protocols to achieve these results, while minimizing the potential serious toxicities of therapy. Some of the serious effects of therapy, such as secondary malignancy and heart disease, are not evident until years after treatment is completed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-and-after-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring of the patient with classical Hodgkin lymphoma during and after treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term follow-up of the patient with classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second malignancies after treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In an attempt to minimize late complications, there has been a gradual change in treatment regimens, including a considerable decrease in radiation doses and volumes; the use of multiagent chemotherapy in combination with radiation (permitting the administration of fewer cycles of less toxic drugs); and the use of multiagent chemotherapy alone, especially in those patients who have a high risk of late effects from the radiation exposure (ie, young women and breast cancer risk).</p><p>Patients with HL have a significant likelihood of being cured of disease even after recurrence or relapse following initial treatment. Therefore, consideration for the long term complications of successful primary and secondary therapy is warranted. As examples:</p><p>Recurrence after initial chemotherapy is usually treated with conventional or high dose chemotherapy. Patients may also achieve prolonged control of their disease after two or more recurrences by means of intensive therapy supported by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation regimens. When patients are not cured (cure is less likely with each recurrence) and have exhausted standard treatment programs, they should be managed with palliation as the goal or be considered for experimental programs. Some patients with persistent HL, despite multiple courses of treatment, tolerate their disease relatively well for prolonged periods.

The definitions used for radiation fields in the treatment of HL are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78652\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78652 \">table 2</a>).

Cooperative research groups have used varying definitions of favorable and unfavorable prognosis disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma#H9398983\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Favorable or unfavorable risk early stage disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-favorable-prognosis-early-stage-i-ii-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of favorable prognosis early (stage I-II) classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The two most commonly used definitions of favorable disease are those proposed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The EORTC defines the limited stage favorable prognostic group as patients age 50 or under; without large mediastinal adenopathy; with an ESR of less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h</span> and no B symptoms (or with an ESR of less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h</span> in those who have B symptoms); and disease limited to three or fewer regions of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The GHSG defines the limited stage favorable prognostic group as patients with no more than two sites of disease; no extranodal extension; no mediastinal mass measuring one-third the maximum thoracic diameter or greater; and ESR less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h</span> (less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h</span> if B symptoms present) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients who do not fall into these categories are considered to have unfavorable prognosis early stage HL. Patients with favorable prognosis disease appear to have acceptable outcomes with less intensive therapy than that required for those with unfavorable prognosis early stage or advanced stage disease. </p><p>Patients with early stage disease are treated with a combination of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy. The amount of chemotherapy and dose of radiation differs for patients with favorable and unfavorable prognosis disease. While treatment with initial radiotherapy had resulted in high cure rates among patients with early stage disease, toxicity was substantially reduced and long-term disease control was improved when chemotherapy was added. As such, radiotherapy is rarely, if ever, used currently as the sole treatment of HL. Patients who relapse after initial treatment with radiotherapy alone can be successfully treated with combination chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Despite the increasing availability of guidelines for the treatment of HL, there must remain room for individualization of treatment. In particular, patient preference must be considered with different treatment options, some of which result in a higher recurrence risk at the gain of less toxic initial treatment. Treatment should also be individualized when a particular approach might result in a higher risk of a serious late complication (eg, the use of large radiation fields and the risk of late breast cancer in young females and of lung cancer in smokers).

For most patients, we administer ABVD plus radiation therapy. Combination chemotherapy alone may be considered an alternative for patients with non-bulky unfavorable early stage disease.

Restricting fields reduces the risk of pulmonary complications related to the radiation, while treatment of the original tumor volume is associated with enhanced risk.
