The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that 6.3 million men and 14.2 million women aged 20 to 74 in the United States had gallbladder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Over the past two decades, a great deal has been learned about the epidemiology of and risk factors for gallstones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81139\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81139 \">table 1</a>). Ultrasonography has played a major role in this process, providing a rapid, risk-free method of screening large populations. Prior to the availability of ultrasound, most studies relied on highly selective autopsy data and limited oral cholecystography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data are available from a number of large European and American populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57092\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57092 \">table 2</a>). These studies have revealed a marked variation in overall gallstone prevalence between different ethnic populations. As a general rule, there appears to be higher rates of cholelithiasis in Western Caucasian, Hispanic, and Native American populations and lower rates in Eastern European, African American, and Japanese populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/2-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-18</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the age standardized prevalence of gallbladder disease was estimated based upon a sample of more than 14,000 persons aged 20 to 74 in whom gallbladder disease was detected by the presence of gallstones or cholecystectomy on ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following prevalence rates were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>8.6 and 16.6 percent among non-Hispanic white men and women, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>8.9 and 26.7 percent among Mexican American men and women, respectively</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5.3 percent and 13.9 percent among non-Hispanic black men and women, respectively</p><p/><p>In other studies, Native Americans had the highest prevalence of cholelithiasis in North America. As an example, 73 percent of female Pima Indians over the age of 25 years have gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similar high rates have been found in multiple other Native American populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/9,10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,19</a>].</p><p>As illustrated above, African Americans appear to have the lowest prevalence of cholelithiasis. Autopsy-based studies performed in the 1950s found that African Americans had one-half to one-quarter the risk of cholelithiasis compared with Caucasian Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]; later reports have shown a 40 percent lower risk of hospitalization for gallstone related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Large ultrasound-based studies from Europe have characterized both gallstone prevalence and incidence. As an example, the Multicenter Italian Study of Cholelithiasis (MICOL) examined nearly 33,000 subjects aged 30 to 69 years in 18 cohorts in 10 Italian regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The overall rate of gallstone disease was 18.8 percent in women and 9.5 percent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Similar results were noted in the Sirmione study in which an overall prevalence rate of 11 percent in 1930 Italian subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Ultrasound examinations were repeated on the same patients at five-year intervals. The 10-year cumulative incidence of new gallstones was 4.6 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the variability of gallstones in different ethnic populations, a number of other risk factors for this condition have been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age is a major risk factor for the gallstones. Gallstones are exceedingly rare in children except in the presence of hemolytic states; in addition, less than 5 percent of all cholecystectomies are performed in children. Age 40 appears to represent the cutoff between relatively low and high rates of cholecystectomies. This observation was validated in the Sirmione study in which the incidence between the ages of 40 and 69 years was four times higher than that in younger subjects. Among the 135 patients with gallstones, only one was between the ages of 18 and 21 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, a higher prevalence of gallstones has been observed in women in all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/7,8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,13</a>]. The difference between women and men is particularly striking in young adults. The GREPCO study found a female-to-male ratio of 2.9 between the ages of 30 to 39 years; the ratio narrowed to 1.6 between the ages of 40 to 49 years and 1.2 between the ages of 50 to 59 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The higher rates in young women is almost certainly a result of pregnancy and sex steroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is a major risk factor for the development of cholesterol gallstones. The risk is related to both the frequency and number of pregnancies. In one report, for example, the prevalence of gallstones increased from 1.3 percent in nulliparous females to 12.2 percent in multiparous females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another study recruited 272 women in the first trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The incidence of new biliary sludge and gallstones was 31 and 2 percent, respectively.</p><p>Sex hormones induce a variety of physiologic changes in the biliary system, which ultimately cause bile to become supersaturated with cholesterol, thereby promoting gallstone formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supersaturation occurs as a result of an estrogen-induced increase in cholesterol secretion and a progesterone-induced reduction in bile acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy induces a qualitative change in bile acid synthesis characterized by relative overproduction of hydrophobic bile acids such as chenodeoxycholate, thereby reducing the ability of bile to solubilize cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progesterone-induced slowing of gallbladder emptying further promotes the formation of stones by causing bile stasis.</p><p/><p>These changes normalize one to two months following delivery. In the postpartum period, gallbladder sludge resolves in 61 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and approximately 30 percent of stones smaller than 10 mm disappear due at least in part to unsaturation of bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies have shown that estrogen therapy is associated with higher rates of gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. The following associations have been noted in different reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A secondary analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative (consisting of two randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing estrogen or estrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women with and without a hysterectomy, respectively) found a significantly increased risk of biliary tract disease among women using estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Both trials showed a greater risk of any gallbladder disease or surgery in the groups randomized to estrogen (hazard ratios [HR] of 1.67 and 1.59 in the estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin studies, respectively). Women receiving estrogen were more likely to experience an episode of cholecystitis (HR of 1.80 and 1.54, respectively) and were more likely to undergo cholecystectomy (HR of 1.93 and 1.67, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, in a French study of 45,984 postmenopausal women, the use of hormone therapy was associated with an increased risk of cholecystectomy (HR 1.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, in that study, the increase in risk was limited to women receiving unopposed estrogen (HR 1.38).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study that included 1,001,391 women with 6,102,811 person-years of follow-up, 19,889 women (2 percent) had a first admission for gallbladder disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Gallbladder disease was defined as a primary diagnosis of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis or a cholecystectomy. Compared with women who had never used hormone replacement therapy, current and past users had an increased risk of gallbladder disease (relative risk [RR] 1.64). Among current users of hormone replacement therapy, compared with never-users, the risk of gallbladder disease was lower with transdermal therapy than with oral therapy (RR 1.17 versus 1.68).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Nurses' Health Study among 54,845 postmenopausal women, those currently using postmenopausal hormones were at an increased risk of cholecystectomy (RR 2.1) compared with never-users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For current users, the risk of cholecystectomy increased with increasing duration of hormone use and higher doses of estrogen. The risk for past hormone users decreased substantially in women who had discontinued use within the preceding one to three years (RR 1.6), a small but significant risk persisted for women who had stopped taking hormones five or more years previously (RR 1.3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men receiving estrogen therapy had an increased rate of gallstones compared with controls. In one study of men who had had a myocardial infarction, treatment with estrogen or clofibrate was associated with more than a twofold increase in risk of gallbladder disease compared with those receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another report of men with prostate cancer, new gallstones detected by ultrasonography developed at one year in 5 of 28 men treated with estrogen compared with none of 26 who underwent orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Estrogen treated men had a 40 percent increase in biliary cholesterol excretion compared with age-matched controls.</p><p/><p>Oral contraceptive use also appears to cause a slight increase in the risk of gallstone formation. Women under the age of 40 years and those taking high-dose estrogen (&gt;50 mcg) preparations have the greatest added risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. It has been suggested that oral contraceptives have only a transient effect on gallstone formation. In support of this hypothesis, a case control study found a slightly higher incidence of gallstones shortly after starting oral contraceptives, an effect which disappeared after 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A similar relationship was noted in a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history and genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family history studies suggest that genetics has a significant role in the development of gallstones. Investigators performed oral cholecystography in 171 first-degree relatives of patients with gallstones and 200 age matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Gallstones occurred more than twice as often in the family group: 20.5 versus 9 percent. A more recent study evaluated 330 first-degree relatives of 105 patients with gallstones using ultrasonography; cholelithiasis was found in 15.5 percent compared with only 3.6 percent of matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The risk was greater in female relatives in both of these studies.</p><p>The great variation in gallstone rates amongst different ethnic groups described above could be due to genetic as well as dietary and cultural habits. A dramatic example occurs in Pima Indians who have exceptionally high rates of cholesterol gallstones: 73 percent in women over the age of 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity (defined as weight greater than 120 percent of ideal body weight) is a well established risk factor for the development of cholesterol gallstones, presumably due to enhanced cholesterol synthesis and secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74965 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. The risk is particularly high in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/20,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,43,44</a>], in those with morbid obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/42,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45</a>], and in younger age groups in which a threefold increase in risk has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>It has also been suggested that the incidence of gallbladder disease in morbidly obese subjects may be higher than expected from ultrasonography or oral cholecystography. In one report, 62 morbidly obese patients underwent prophylactic cholecystectomy at the time of a gastric exclusion procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Among the 47 who had normal imaging studies, 40 had abnormal histologic findings in the gallbladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid weight loss is also a risk factor for gallstone formation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;</a>). High rates of gallstone formation have also been associated with very low calorie diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Gallstones which form in association with rapid weight loss appear to be more common in Caucasians and women.</p><p>The mechanism by which this occurs is incompletely understood. One report evaluated changes in gallbladder bile during periods of weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Bile mucin content increased 18-fold and bile calcium concentration rose 40 percent. These factors may promote cholesterol nucleation and stone formation.</p><p>In contrast to the general population in which the great majority of gallstones are asymptomatic, persons with weight loss related cholelithiasis are more likely to be symptomatic. In one series, for example, 28 percent of patients required urgent cholecystectomy within three months after a gastric exclusion procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of stone formation during rapid weight loss. In one trial of 1004 patients treated with a very low calorie diet, ultrasonography was performed at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The incidence of gallstones was 28 percent in the placebo group compared with 8, 3, and 2 percent of those treated with 300, 600, and 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of UDCA, respectively.</p><p>In another controlled trial, 68 obese subjects were randomized to UDCA (1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, or placebo at the time of entry into a 520 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> diet program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The patients were treated for up to 16 weeks and were reevaluated at four and three weeks after treatment. None of the patients treated with UDCA developed gallstones or cholesterol crystals in the bile compared with five and six patients, respectively, in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001). The bile saturation index fell by about 18 percent with UDCA compared with a 20 percent elevation in the patients receiving placebo.</p><p>Based upon these observations, we recommend that obese patients should be started on UDCA, 600 mg at night, during very low calorie diets or after weight reduction surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes mellitus appears to be associated with an increased risk of gallstones.

Diabetes was more prevalent in the patients with gallbladder disease (11.6 versus 4.8 percent). In another case control study, an increased prevalence of gallstones in diabetes could only be demonstrated in women (42 versus 26 percent in nondiabetic women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>How diabetes predisposes to gallstones is not well understood. Hepatic insulin resistance appears to be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Other contributing factors may be hypertriglyceridemia and autonomic neuropathy leading to biliary stasis due to gallbladder hypomotility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise role of serum lipids on gallstone formation is not known.

In a population-based study from Denmark that included 61,212 subjects, patients with mean bilirubin levels in the highest decile had an increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease compared with patients who had lower mean bilirubin levels (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cirrhosis is a major risk factor for gallstones. The increased risk was illustrated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal study that included 1010 patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The overall prevalence of gallstones was 29.5 percent. During an average follow-up of 50 months, 141 of 618 patients (23 percent) developed gallstones (which is approximately 10 times higher than would be expected in a general population). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the risk was increased in patients with Child classes B and C cirrhosis (regardless of the cause), and in patients with a high body mass index. The increased risk of gallstone formation in these patients may be due to several factors, including reduced hepatic synthesis and transport of bile salts and nonconjugated bilirubin, high estrogen levels, and impaired gallbladder contraction in response to a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder stasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that result in bile stasis are associated with a higher prevalence of gallstones. In the normal state, the gallbladder avidly absorbs water from bile. Thus, if bile remains within the gallbladder for a prolonged period, it can become overly concentrated with cholesterol, thereby promoting stone formation. Common examples of this mechanism include spinal cord injuries, prolonged fasting and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (both of which prevent the normal enteral stimulation of gallbladder activity), and excess somatostatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/64-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-69</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallstones are a frequent complication of prolonged <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].

Two factors are thought to contribute: biliary stasis due to lack of enteral stimulation; and, in patients with ileal resection, interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids results in a reduction in hepatic bile acid secretion and an altered composition of hepatic bile which becomes supersaturated with respect to cholesterol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatostatin, probably via reduced cholecystokinin release, is a potent inhibitor of gallbladder emptying.

Fenofibrate has also been associated with gallstone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Fibrates reduce bile acid secretion by inhibiting the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase; this results in cholesterol supersaturated bile and stone precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].<br/><br/>In a population study from France that included 5466 inhabitants, the use of a fibrate (primarily fenofibrate) was associated with an increased risk of gallstone formation (adjusted relative risk 1.7; 95% CI 1-2.7, p = 0.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

This was illustrated in the Physicians' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of over 45,000 men, in which 828 subjects developed symptomatic gallstones during eight years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The men in the lowest quintile of physical activity had a relative risk of 1.72 between the ages of 40 and 64 and 1.33 above age 64 compared with those in the highest quintile. It was estimated that 34 percent of cases of symptomatic gallstones in men could be prevented by 30 minutes of endurance-type training five times per week.</p><p>The Nurses' Health Study also demonstrated the benefit of physical activity for the prevention of symptomatic cholelithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The study included 60,290 women between the ages of 40 to 65 who were followed for 10 years during which 3257 underwent cholecystectomy. On multivariate analysis, the relative risk for women in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of physical activity was 0.69. In contrast, women who had a sedentary lifestyle were at increased risk of cholecystectomy (relative risk 1.42).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Crohn disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of gallstones is increased in patients with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-80</a>]. In a population-based study in Sweden, for example, gallstones were detected in 26 percent of patients with Crohn disease, which was approximately twice as frequent as the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Gallstones in patients with ileal Crohn disease (or those who have undergone ileal resection) are frequently pigment based, reflecting an increased concentration of bilirubin conjugates, unconjugated bilirubin, and total calcium in the gallbladder bile due perhaps to altered enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders associated with hemolysis increase the risk of pigmented gallstones.

A case-control study compared 27,035 patients with gallstone disease requiring cholecystectomy with 106,531 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Long-term statin use (&gt;20 prescriptions filled) was associated with a decreased risk of gallstone disease requiring cholecystectomy (adjusted OR 0.64). The protective effect of statins started to be seen after approximately 1 to 1.5 years of statin use. </p><p>Similar results were observed in a population study from Denmark with 32,494 patients with gallstone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The cases were matched with 324,925 controls. Among current statin users who had filled at least 20 prescriptions, the odds ratio of having gallstone disease was 0.76 compared with nonusers. In prior users who had filled at least 20 prescriptions, the odds ratio was 0.79.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Ascorbic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The observation that deficiency of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is associated with the development of gallstones in guinea pigs prompted investigation of the relationship between ascorbic acid levels and gallstones in humans. One study included 7042 women and 6088 men who were enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In that survey, a history of clinical or asymptomatic gallstones was correlated with serum ascorbic acid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Among women, each standard deviation increase in serum ascorbic acid levels (27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> was associated with a 13 percent lower prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease. For unclear reasons, the relationship did not hold true in men. The benefit of ascorbic acid may be related to its effects on cholesterol catabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Coffee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coffee consumption has been associated with a decreased risk of developing gallstones. In a meta-analysis that included 227,749 participants, patients who drank coffee were less likely than those who did not to develop gallstones (relative risk [RR] 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.89) when prospective studies were examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Subjects who consistently drank two to three cups of regular coffee per day were approximately 40 percent less likely to develop symptomatic gallstones during follow-up. The benefit was even greater in those who drank four or more cups per day (relative risk 0.55). In contrast, decaffeinated coffee was not protective. A similar benefit from regular coffee was noted in a cohort study involving 81,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of benefit is not precisely known.

Comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles of intake, the risk was reduced by about 20 percent (relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88), with a significant dose-response relationship. There has also been an association of reduced risk of gallstone disease in men associated with the daily consumption of nuts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Poly- and monounsaturated fats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mono- and polyunsaturated fats inhibit cholesterol gallstone formation in animals.
