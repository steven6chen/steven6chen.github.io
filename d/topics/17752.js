No curative therapies are available. Management options include oral medications, botulinum toxin injection, and deep brain stimulation.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of dystonia. Other clinical aspects of dystonia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many oral agents have been used to treat dystonia, but they have not been extensively studied in rigorous controlled trials. The available evidence suggests that several drugs are beneficial in a proportion of patients with dystonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75422 \">table 1</a>). However, the therapeutic window for most of the oral agents is narrow, and side effects frequently limit clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Levodopa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levodopa is dramatically beneficial in dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). Often, small doses of levodopa one to three times daily can virtually eliminate the dystonic symptoms of DRD for an indefinite period of time without causing motor complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A sustained and complete response occurs with variable doses ranging from 100 to 750 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. One case series of 20 patients reported that the mean daily levodopa doses for clinical benefit in patients with and without associated dyskinesia were 343 mg and 189 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In other forms of dystonia, the response rate with levodopa is approximately 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Levodopa is available in combination with the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a> or benserazide. Treatment should be initiated with low doses, similar to its use in Parkinson disease, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100</span> mg, one-half tablet two to three times daily with meals. Once started without side effects, the total daily dose can be increased carefully and as tolerated over several weeks to a full tablet of <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100</span> mg three times daily. The usual practice is to titrate to the lowest levodopa dose that produces a useful clinical response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticholinergic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] studies suggest that anticholinergic drugs are beneficial in focal and generalized dystonia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one of the few controlled trials, with 31 children and young adults who had early onset dystonia, high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trihexyphenidyl</a> (up to 30 mg daily) was effective in the management of torsion dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial of nine adult patients with cranial dystonia found no benefit for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trihexyphenidyl</a> or a peripheral anticholinergic agent compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One open label study reported that anticholinergic treatment for dystonia was effective in a greater proportion of children than adults, probably because children were able to tolerate higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>Evaluating these data, a systematic review from the European Federation of Neurological Societies concluded that there is no proof that anticholinergic drugs are effective in adults, and that the effectiveness and tolerability of anticholinergic drugs in children is poorly documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Trihexyphenidyl dosing and side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticholinergic treatment is initiated at low doses. For adults, the typical starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trihexyphenidyl</a> is 1 mg twice daily. The dose is gradually increased in 2 mg increments at intervals of three to seven days until sufficient improvement or unacceptable side effects occur. Full benefit from gradual dose escalation may be delayed for several weeks or months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The drug label suggests a maximum total daily dose (given in three or four divided doses) of 15 mg daily for adults and 6 to 10 mg daily for elderly patients. However, some patients may tolerate a higher dose if needed to control symptoms.</p><p>A more aggressive regimen, which should be used only for children or young adults, begins with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trihexyphenidyl</a> 2 mg twice daily, followed by gradual dose increases every week as needed to achieve benefit, unless dose limiting side effects occur. In children, the maximum dose of trihexyphenidyl may be as high as 100 mg daily given in three to four divided doses. As noted above, benefit may be delayed for several weeks.</p><p>Other anticholinergic agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a>, and those with both anticholinergic and antihistaminergic effects (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procyclidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procyclidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>) have also been used anecdotally. For each of these agents, a similar slow titration to benefit or side effects is recommended.</p><p>Discontinuation of anticholinergic agents should be gradual, as withdrawal effects may occur.</p><p>Anticholinergic side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, pupil dilatation, and increased intraocular pressure. Dry mouth may increase the occurrence of dental caries.</p><p>Additional side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trihexyphenidyl</a> include dizziness, confusion, memory impairment, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. The central side effects, including memory loss and sedation, are dose limiting.</p><p>Narrow-angle glaucoma, confusion, and dementia are contraindications to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trihexyphenidyl</a>. Trihexyphenidyl should be used with caution in people over 60, and in patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy or obstructive gastrointestinal disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetrabenazine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetrabenazine</a> combines monoaminergic depletion and dopamine antagonist effects. Evidence from small trials and case series suggests that tetrabenazine is beneficial in a variety of hyperkinetic movement disorders, including dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small double-blind crossover trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> treatment resulted in improvement in 9 of 12 patients with different types of dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective case series that included 108 patients with idiopathic dystonia reported sustained benefit for a mean duration of 6.6 years in about 62 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetrabenazine</a> is initiated with 12.5 mg daily for one week and increased by 12.5 mg increments every week, according to clinical response and as tolerated, to a level of 75 to 150 mg daily.</p><p>Side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> are frequent and include sedation, parkinsonism, depression, akathisia, nervousness, and insomnia. Patients should be warned specifically that severe depression can occur and that they should notify their physician if signs or symptoms of depression or suicidality develop.</p><p>Tardive dyskinesia has not been associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a>, probably because its site of action is the presynaptic nerve terminal.

Clonazepam may be particularly beneficial for patients who note worsening of dystonia with stress and anxiety, although this has not been studied. The typical starting dose of clonazepam is 0.5 mg once a day, given in the evening before bed time. The dose may be slowly increased in 0.5 mg increments every week. Adverse effects from clonazepam include sedation, depression, confusion, and dependence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One review found retrospective evidence that high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> (40 to 180 mg daily) was associated with improvement in approximately 30 percent of children and adolescents (n = 31) with idiopathic generalized dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Baclofen was less effective for 60 adults with focal cranial dystonia, with sustained benefit in 18 percent. Side effects of oral baclofen, including nausea and sedation, may be intolerable. The sudden withdrawal of baclofen can cause serious side effects, including seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> administration allows for regionally elevated spinal fluid levels, thereby reducing the occurrence of central side effects. However, it has yet to be established as an effective treatment for dystonia not associated with spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Zolpidem</a> has been reported to improve dystonia in patients with blepharospasm, Meige syndrome, myoclonus dystonia, and X-linked dystonia parkinsonism in small series and single cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dopamine receptor blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> are beneficial in some patients with dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, this class of medications is not recommended for the treatment of dystonia because of the associated risk of tardive dyskinesia, a disorder that may be disabling and irreversible.

Disruption of these fusion proteins interferes with the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in localized muscle weakness.</p><p>Botulinum toxin treatment is beneficial for patients with cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) and blepharospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is also viewed as the treatment of choice for spasmodic dysphonia (ie, laryngeal dystonia), limb dystonia, and oromandibular dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Two serotypes, botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) and botulinum toxin type B (BoNT-B), are available commercially.

BoNT-B is also an effective treatment for cervical dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], but is usually reserved for patients who fail BoNT-A treatment as manifested by lack of improvement, absence of side effects, and loss of muscle denervation.</p><p>Both BoNT-A and BoNT-B are significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of cervical dystonia, as noted in the following reports.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of BoNT-A treatment for cervical dystonia published in 2017 identified eight randomized controlled trials that enrolled 1010 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. All the trials evaluated a single BoNT treatment session. At week four after injection, BoNT treatment compared with placebo led to a reduction in the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score of 8.1 points (95% CI 6.1-10.1), corresponding to an average improvement from baseline of 19 percent. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diffuse <span class=\"nowrap\">weakness/tiredness</span> (10 percent) and dysphagia (9 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2016 meta-analysis of BoNT-B treatment for cervical dystonia identified four trials enrolling 441 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Most patients had previously been treated with BoNT-A; subjects with pure retrocollis or anterocollis were excluded from three of the trials. Compared with placebo, there was a statistically and clinically significant benefit for BoNT-B therapy at week four after injection, with a mean reduction in the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score of 6.8 points (95% CI 4.5-9.0). Subjective rating scales also improved. The main side effects of treatment were dry mouth and dysphagia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An evidence-based review of data from randomized controlled trials updated in 2016 by the American Academy of Neurology concluded that BoNT is safe and effective for the treatment of cervical dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Similar conclusions were reached by the 2011 European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Although long-term data are limited, an observational study of 45 patients with different types of dystonia, including 19 with cervical dystonia, reported that the response to BoNT injections remained consistent for &ge;12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Limited data suggest that BoNT-A is more effective for cervical dystonia than anticholinergic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trihexyphenidyl</a>. In a short-duration double-blind randomized trial of 66 patients, BoNT-A was significantly more beneficial than trihexyphenidyl for improvement on the TWSTRS disability score, and the difference was similar in size to that obtained in the meta-analysis comparing BoNT-A with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In addition, BoNT-A was better tolerated than trihexyphenidyl.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other focal dystonias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BoNT is probably effective for the treatment of blepharospasm, focal upper limb dystonia (including writer's cramp), and adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ie, adductor laryngeal dystonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/24,25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,32</a>], while abductor spasmodic dysphonia (ie, abductor laryngeal dystonia) responds less predictably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The evidence is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized controlled trial of 109 patients with blepharospasm, BoNT-A was more effective than placebo, with statistically significant benefits for reducing blepharospasm severity and functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Benefit lasted a median of approximately 11 weeks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial randomly assigned 40 patients with writer's cramp to treatment with either BoNT-A or placebo injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. At 12 weeks, the proportion of patients who reported a beneficial effect and chose to continue treatment (the primary outcome measure) was significantly greater in the BoNT-A group than the placebo group (70 versus 32 percent). In addition, improvement on most, but not all of the clinical rating scales favored BoNT-A treatment. Transient hand weakness, generally mild, was a side effect of BoNT-A in 75 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a double-blind trial involving 13 patients with adductor-type laryngeal dystonia, seven patients were treated with BoNT-A and six received saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. There was significant benefit for several outcomes in the BoNT-A group, including quantitative measures of voice function and subjective patient ratings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 15 patients with abductor spasmodic dysphonia that compared different injection techniques of BoNT-A into the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, improvement with BoNT-A injections was reported by 11 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, blinded assessment by speech pathologists found no statistically significant objective benefit with either BoNT-A injection technique.

BoNT-B is designated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rimabotulinumtoxinb-myobloc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rimabotulinumtoxinB</a>. Each of these products is a unique drug with regard to formulation, potency, and dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. There is no unique dose ratio to permit switching among different BoNT products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, clinical trial experience suggests that treatment can be switched between onabotulinumtoxinA and incobotulinumtoxinA using a 1 to 1 conversion ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, there is no consensus regarding standard practices for BoNT injections, including dilution ratios for the different BoNT products, the dose per injection, the total dose per muscle, the number of injections at each site, or the methods of targeting injections (eg, whether guided by vision, electromyography, or ultrasound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. All of these parameters vary among practitioners and centers.</p><p>Side effects with BoNT treatment are frequent but typically mild and transient. In the systematic reviews of BoNT for cervical dystonia, adverse events that were significantly more frequent than placebo injection with BoNT-A were diffuse <span class=\"nowrap\">weakness/tiredness</span> and dysphagia; other adverse events included neck weakness, dry <span class=\"nowrap\">mouth/sore</span> throat, and voice <span class=\"nowrap\">changes/hoarseness</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Adverse events associated with BoNT-B treatment included dysphagia and dry mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These side effects are clearly related to the mechanism of action of BoNT. They are attributable to excessive weakness in injected muscles or to diffusion of toxin into nearby structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177815404\"><span class=\"h2\">Lack of clinical response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with dystonia continue to respond to long-term treatment with BoNT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the absence or loss of treatment response to BoNT can occur for a variety of reasons, including inadequate dose, inappropriate muscle selection, concurrent drug therapy, a change in disease state, or the development of neutralizing antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. When loss of treatment response to BoNT does occur, it is usually not associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One of the largest studies of long-term treatment reported that a lack of clinical responsiveness to BoNT-A to at least one injection was observed for 73 subjects, of whom 69 tested negative for neutralizing antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The proportion of patients who develop neutralizing antibodies during long-term treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> is &lt;2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43</a>], perhaps due to its low protein load per unit dose.

With BoNT-B (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rimabotulinumtoxinb-myobloc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rimabotulinumtoxinB</a>), an analysis of four clinical trials with up to six year of follow-up found that the rate of neutralizing antibody formation was 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dystonia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The mainstay of surgical treatment is deep brain microelectrode stimulation of the internal segment of the globus pallidus.</p><p>Bilateral thalamotomy was used in the 1960s and 1970s for generalized dystonia. However, permanent and serious complications from the procedure (hemiparesis, spasticity, ataxia, dysphagia, and dysarthria) were prohibitive.

Two investigators, who were blind to both group assignment and to chronologic order of the examinations, assessed the severity of dystonia by reviewing videotaped sessions of patients made at baseline and after treatment. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the movement subscore on the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). The following observations were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At three months, improvement in the severity of symptoms on the BFMDRS movement subscore was significantly greater in the GPi stimulation group than in the sham stimulation group (-15.8 versus -1.4 points).
