It is a common problem in children and constitutes up to 40 percent of pediatric urology clinic visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In some children, bladder dysfunction is a component of bowel and bladder dysfunction (BBD), previously referred to as dysfunctional elimination, which involves abnormalities in both bladder and bowel emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The etiology and clinical features of non-neurologic bladder dysfunction in children will be reviewed here. The evaluation of non-neurologic bladder dysfunction in children is discussed separately.

This term can be applied to children who have achieved bladder control regardless of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Straining &ndash; Straining is defined as the application of abdominal pressure (Valsalva maneuver) by the child to initiate and maintain voiding, and may be a pertinent finding in all age groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak stream &ndash; A weak stream is defined as the observed ejection of urine with a weak force and may be a pertinent finding in all age groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent stream &ndash; Intermittency of voiding is defined as a voiding stream of urine that occurs in several discrete bursts rather than the normal continuous stream. It is a normal physiologic pattern in children three years of age or younger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria &ndash; Dysuria is defined as burning or discomfort during voiding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Holding maneuvers &ndash; Holding maneuvers are observed behavior used to either postpone voiding or suppress urgency. Common maneuvers include standing on tiptoe, forcefully crossing the legs, or squatting with a hand pressed into the perineum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75506 \">picture 1</a>) (Vincent's curtsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]).

Urinary continence is generally achieved after successful daytime and nighttime bowel continence.</p><p>The development of normal voiding and urine storage consists of increasing bladder capacity, improved coordination of the bladder and urinary sphincter, and decreasing frequency of incontinence with age. Although strict definitions do not exist for defining normal voiding habits by age, normal voiding is typically considered a lack of dysfunctional voiding habits as described above and discussed elsewhere.

These skills usually are achieved, at least during the day, by approximately four years of age. Nighttime bladder control can be achieved months to years after daytime control, but is not considered abnormal until after five to seven years of age. As voluntary bladder control matures, bladder capacity also increases and voiding frequency decreases.</p><p>Urinary continence is dependent upon a complex interrelationship between autonomic and somatic nerves, which are integrated at various sites in the spinal cord, brainstem, midbrain, and higher cortical centers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65433 \">figure 1</a>). The normal coordination of the central and peripheral nervous system network permits the filling of the bladder and urine storage at low pressure with high outlet resistance, and voiding with low outlet resistance and sustained detrusor (bladder wall muscle) contraction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Filling phase &ndash; To eliminate bladder contraction during the filling phase, activation of the sympathetic nervous system beta receptors of the bladder fundus results in detrusor muscle relaxation. Activation of sympathetic alpha receptors at the bladder neck result in bladder neck contraction and increased bladder outlet resistance. Stimulation of the pudendal motor neurons contracts the external urinary sphincter closing the bladder outlet and ensuring continence during the filling phase. The normal bladder is highly compliant and allows the storage of urine at low pressures. One study reported that over 95 percent of children have bladder storage pressures of &lt;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O at full capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If the bladder stores urine at high pressures (&gt;40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), kidney injury may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voiding phase &ndash; As the bladder fills, stretching activates mechanoreceptors, which send an ascending signal through the spinal cord to the pontine micturition center in the brainstem. A descending signal from the pontine micturition through the spinal cord results in inhibition of the pudendal motor neurons, which relaxes the external urinary sphincter, stimulation of the parasympathetic outflow via the pelvic splanchnic nerves resulting in detrusor muscle contraction, and inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system through the hypogastric nerves, which relaxes the bladder neck. Input from the higher cerebral centers can modify the function of the pontine micturition center. The normal infant voids approximately 20 times per day, which results in small voided volumes and incomplete bladder emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Infantile bladder function had been thought to be due to a primarily immature state of filling and emptying by spinal cord reflex without volitional cortical control. However, some element of cortical control in infants appears to be present as supported by the observation that infants void while awake or during arousal from sleep and never during the quiet sleep phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, it is suggested that the development of voluntary urinary control is a learned modification of the already preexisting integrated network between the peripheral and central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>The timing of urinary continence during childhood varies. However, the vast majority of children (85 to 95 percent) are continent by 10 years of age based on large observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder dysfunction results from disruptions of the normal voiding process by any alteration of the innervation of the bladder or external sphincter, bladder compliance or volume capacity, detrusor muscle function, or structure of the bladder or bladder outlet. These include neurogenic, anatomic, or functional causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurogenic causes &ndash; Neurogenic causes of bladder dysfunction disrupt the innervation of the bladder or external sphincter. Neurogenic causes are due to either congenital anomalies, such as myelomeningocele, or trauma to the central nervous system (eg, spinal cord injury). Any child with a suspected neurologic abnormality should be evaluated for occult neurologic lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract complications of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic causes &ndash; Children with an anatomic abnormality generally have a history of never gaining urinary control because the anatomic defect either bypasses the bladder outlet, such as ectopic ureter with insertion distal to the bladder neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78218\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78218 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65413\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65413 \">figure 3</a>), or there is obstruction of the bladder outlet (eg, posterior urethral valves). Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has also been identified as a risk factor for BBD. In a secondary multivarialbe analysis of data from the Randomized Intervention for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) and Careful Urinary Tract Infection Evaluation (CUTIE) trials identified female sex and dilating VUR at baseline as risk factors for developing BBD in 111 children during the study periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Proposed theories regarding the pathogenesis of functional bladder dysfunction include maturation delay, prolongation of infantile bladder behavior, or abnormal acquired toilet training habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/2,3,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,19,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF BLADDER DYSFUNCTION DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) has developed standardized definitions of several bladder dysfunction conditions based upon symptom complex and urodynamic tests.

The groupings are based upon the opinions of experts in the field of pediatric bladder dysfunction and there may be overlap between these conditions. In addition, changes in symptoms can evolve over time so that a single child may have components of different conditions. As an example, a child may start with an overactive bladder with urge incontinence and develop dysfunctional voiding. As new data emerge, future modifications of these conditions will be performed by the board of the ICCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and diagnosis of these conditions are discussed separately.

Incontinence and increased frequency are also common features of an overactive bladder. Holding maneuvers, such as Vincent's curtsy (squatting position with the legs crossed to prevent micturition or leaking), are often observed in affected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of overactive bladder decreases with increasing age as illustrated in a study of the micturition habits of 1034 Swedish students evaluated twice, once when entering school and once during adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

The overall incidence of overactive bladder defined as urgency with or without incontinence was 17 percent. The rate declined with increasing age, with the highest incidence in five-year-old children of 23 percent and the lowest in 13-year-old patients of 12 percent. Children with symptoms of overactive bladder compared with those without symptoms were more likely to have nocturnal enuresis, constipation, fecal incontinence, a history of urinary tract infection, delayed bladder control, and poor toilet facilities.

Resulting in a low frequency of voiding. These children commonly have behavioral issues or have a psychological comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with voiding postponement will utilize holding maneuvers to prevent voiding. These children generally have a low voiding frequency with long-time intervals between voids that result in increasing bladder capacity over time. With overdistension of the bladder, the detrusor muscle becomes overstretched and hypoactive leading to a weak or absent contraction referred to as an underactive bladder, which was formerly called &quot;lazy bladder syndrome&quot; or myogenic failure. Children with underactive bladder will use a Valsalva maneuver to increase abdominal pressure (ie, straining) to aid in bladder emptying. However, despite these efforts, large-volume post-void residuals with overflow incontinence are common in these children. Children with underactive bladder are at increased risk for urinary tract infection because of post-void residuals. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Underactive bladder is seen in about 7 percent of children with dysfunctional voiding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In these children, urodynamic studies demonstrate the abnormal contraction of the sphincter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic floor musculature during voiding. Urinary flow is interrupted, producing a staccato pattern and a prolonged voiding time.</p><p>Non-neurogenic dysfunctional voiding, also referred to as Hinman-Allen syndrome, is the most severe form of dysfunctional voiding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The contraction of the sphincter during voiding and overactivity of the detrusor muscle can lead to high voiding pressure, bladder decompensation, and a predisposition for infection and renal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

VUR is thought to be due to the increased intravesical pressure generated during voiding against the closed sphincter. In more severe cases, imaging studies demonstrate hydronephrosis due to severe VUR, and trabeculated bladder due to bladder wall hypertrophy. Incomplete emptying is common and predisposes the child to a UTI.

Children with giggle incontinence have normal bladder function when the child is not laughing and should be differentiated from urinary leakage with laughter in children who have persistent voiding symptoms when they are not laughing. It occurs almost exclusively in girls and is characterized by large-volume voids.</p><p>Although the etiology of giggle incontinence is unclear, one theory suggests that this disorder is mediated by the central nervous system. The proposed mechanism is similar to that of cataplexy, in which an emotional event causes muscle hypotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Treatment of this condition is not well studied.

This is due to urine being temporarily trapped in the vagina during micturition. It occurs particularly in girls who urinate with their legs too closely approximated to permit free egress of urine. It is a pattern that can be seen during voiding cystourethrography with refluxing urine appearing within the vaginal vault during voiding.</p><p>Girls with this condition may also have irritation of the labia and complain of dysuria as the urine passes over the irritated skin.</p><p>Treatment is based upon changing the voiding habits of the child by emphasizing wide abduction of the legs and a forward leaning posture to reduce the likelihood of vaginal reflux of urine. Other helpful tips include sitting backwards on the toilet so that the legs need to straddle the toilet or manually spreading the labia majora while voiding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary neck bladder dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary neck bladder dysfunction is defined as delayed or incomplete opening of the bladder neck during voiding in patients with normally functioning sphincter and pelvic floor muscles.
