A1C is one of a group of glycohemoglobins, stable minor hemoglobin components that are formed slowly and nonenzymatically from hemoglobin and glucose. The rate of formation of glycohemoglobins is proportional to the circulating glucose concentration integrated over the time of exposure. The level of A1C in a blood sample ordinarily provides a reliable measure of the glucose levels during the previous two to three months, reflecting the average 120-day life span of the erythrocyte and the normal turnover of the erythrocyte cell mass. Interpretation of the A1C level is valid only if the erythrocytes are produced and removed at the normal rate and are those of the patient. Sources of error include accelerated loss of the patient's red cell mass, in gastrointestinal bleeding as an example, and transfusion of blood from nondiabetic blood donors, both of which can reduce the measured A1C level, as in the patient described above. A1C levels should not be ordered or interpreted under these circumstances.</p><p>The dangers of interpreting an A1C level in such a setting are undertreatment or mistreatment of diabetes. In the patient under consideration, reduction of insulin doses resulted in deterioration of glycemic control and the need to readjust the insulin regimen thereafter. Treatment errors are more likely to occur in patients with complex, multisystem disease such as the one under consideration, in whom the clinician's attention to the nuances of diabetes management may be reduced by the need to address multiple issues under the pressure of time.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Glyburide</a> should not be used in patients with renal insufficiency, as an example, when the creatinine clearance is &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> or the serum creatinine is &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men or &gt;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women. The principal mode of removal of glyburide is hepatic clearance. However, glyburide is transformed in the liver to several derivatives, at least one of which has hypoglycemic activity and is removed by the kidneys. In patients with renal insufficiency, the active derivative accumulates and causes hypoglycemia. Patients with glyburide-induced hypoglycemia should be admitted to the hospital until hyperglycemia returns, indicating the removal of the biologically active derivative.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is contraindicated in the presence of renal insufficiency, in patients with congestive heart failure, and in patients otherwise at risk for acidosis because these conditions predispose the patient to lactic acidosis. When these contraindications are respected, the incidence of this life-threatening and often fatal disorder is extremely low.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-7-management-of-diabetes-in-a-72-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-gi-bleeding-and-multiple-other-medical-problems-comment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-7-management-of-diabetes-in-a-72-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-gi-bleeding-and-multiple-other-medical-problems-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">International Expert Committee.
