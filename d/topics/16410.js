Current cigarette smokers have an increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], although the incremental risk is small in the absence of chronic lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Smoking cessation prior to elective surgery appears to improve a number of outcomes such as wound healing and postoperative pulmonary recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The duration of abstinence from smoking necessary for a reduction in pulmonary complications is not well-established, although more than eight weeks may be preferable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/10,11,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13-18</a>].</p><p>An important clinical question is whether quitting smoking less than eight weeks prior to surgery could actually increase postoperative pulmonary complications. This concern was first raised by a prospective study of 200 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery in which patients who had stopped smoking for two months or less had a pulmonary complication rate almost four times that of patients who had stopped for more than two months (57.1 versus 14.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not supported the concern about short-term smoking cessation being associated with a worse outcome.</p><p>Three meta-analyses addressed the question of the optimal duration of smoking cessation prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/12,13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,20</a>]. In one systematic review, there was no difference in total postoperative or pulmonary complications between current smokers and recent quitters (less than eight weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While they identified no increase in risk for recent quitters, they also found no benefit of a brief duration of cessation. In a separate analysis of a larger number of eligible trials (six randomized trials and 15 observational studies), the data supported different conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They found a reduction in both total (RR 0.76, CI 0.69-0.84) and pulmonary (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.93) complications for past smokers as compared to current smokers. There was no difference between early and late quitters. Each week of cessation increased the beneficial effects of cessation.</p><p>In the largest single trial to address the benefits of preoperative smoking cessation, investigators studied 1335 subjects, including 522 smokers, undergoing gastric surgery for cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Compared with nonsmokers, the odds ratio for postoperative pulmonary complications among those who continued smoking or stopped smoking less than two weeks was 2.92 (1.45-5.90), as compared with 0.98 (0.28-3.45) for those with four to eight weeks of cessation and 1.42 (0.66-3.05) for those with eight or more weeks of cessation.</p><p>As there is no evidence of harm related to a short duration of cigarette abstinence, we advise all patients anticipating elective surgery to quit smoking as soon as possible, regardless of the anticipated date of surgery.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be aggressively treated in order to achieve their best possible baseline level of function.

The National Asthma Education Program consensus statement recommends that patients with asthma undergo a preoperative evaluation to assess asthma control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53233 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients whose asthma is not well-controlled should receive a step-up in asthma therapy; this may include a brief course of systemic glucocorticoids in patients whose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) are below their predicted values or personal best (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56729 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For elective surgery, patients should be free of wheezing and have a peak expiratory flow rate greater than 80 percent of predicted or of their personal best prior to surgery. For patients who require endotracheal intubation, we suggest administering an inhaled rapid-acting beta agonist two to four puffs or a nebulizer treatment within 30 minutes before intubation. Inhaled beta agonists may be continued as needed in the perioperative period; they also can be used in the circuit of anesthesia tubing for prolonged procedures, and for patients still intubated immediately after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma#H1234674294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult patients with asthma&quot;, section on 'Preoperative medication management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-agonists-in-asthma-acute-administration-and-prophylactic-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta agonists in asthma: Acute administration and prophylactic use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One to two days of systemic glucocorticoid therapy has sometimes been advised as a method to prevent acute bronchoconstriction at the time of intubation. However, acute bronchoconstriction is uncommon among patients with well-controlled asthma. Thus, in the absence of clinical trial data, we suggest that preoperative systemic glucocorticoid be reserved for patients with a history of poorly-controlled, brittle, severe, or glucocorticoid dependent asthma. The safety of perioperative systemic glucocorticoid use in asthmatic patients has been demonstrated in numerous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for preoperative management of asthma is discussed separately.

Occasionally, patients using high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids have developed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, routine use of stress dose glucocorticoids in these patients is not recommended.

Many trials reporting a benefit have included primarily healthy patients; those with preexisting lung disease at the highest risk of postoperative complications have been underrepresented.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deep breathing and incentive spirometry</strong> &ndash; Deep breathing exercises and incentive spirometry appear to be equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and capable of reducing the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications although studies are conflicting about the degree of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>]. Deep breathing exercises are a component of chest physical therapy. Incentive spirometry involves deep breathing facilitated by a simple mechanical device. Deep breathing exercises entail a slow, deep inspiration (as close as possible to total lung capacity), followed by a breath-hold of two to five seconds, and finally a slow exhalation approximately to functional residual capacity (FRC). The optimal number of repetitions is not known; up to 30 deep breaths (with 30 to 60 second rests between sets of 10) may be done hourly during waking hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In theory, deep breathing exercises open collapsed alveoli, reduce atelectasis, promote secretion removal, and restore lung volume. Incentive spirometry involves deep breathing facilitated by a simple mechanical device to provide visual feedback. The efficacy of incentive spirometry in preventing postoperative pulmonary complications has been assessed by systematic reviews of patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting and upper abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57</a>]. In both cases, the systematic reviews concluded incentive spirometry was not clearly beneficial, but the size and methodology of the studies were of low quality. In a small study, deep breathing exercises did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications after high-risk upper abdominal surgery when added to early mobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rather than focusing on individual interventions, the I COUGH multidisciplinary program incorporates incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing, oral care (brushing teeth and using mouthwash twice daily), understanding (patient and family education), getting out of bed at least three times daily, and head-of-bed elevation. In a before-and-after design, the I COUGH program reduced the incidence of postoperative pneumonia (2.6 to 1.6 percent) and unplanned reintubation 2 to 1.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a report of 456 patients undergoing abdominal surgery, low risk patients who practiced either incentive spirometry or deep breathing exercises had similar rates of pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. High risk patients, defined as either ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) Class greater than 1 or age over 60 years, received incentive spirometry and were in addition randomly assigned to either chest physical therapy or no additional therapy. There was an insignificant reduction in complications in the combined modality group (13 versus 19 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other data also suggest less benefit of these interventions in low-risk individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/54,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,60,61</a>]. In a systematic review of the efficacy of incentive spirometry in reducing pulmonary complications after upper abdominal surgery, the quality of studies was felt to be only moderate and results were mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In three eligible trials, incentive spirometry was no more effective than no respiratory treatment. On the other hand, complication rates among patients who received incentive spirometry did not differ from those who received deep breathing exercises (two trials) or chest physiotherapy (two trials).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While the findings have been mixed, given the safety and low cost of this intervention, we advise using incentive spirometry after upper abdominal and thoracic surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intermittent positive pressure breathing</strong> &ndash; Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) was used commonly in the 1960s and 1970s, but was associated with more complications than other methods of lung expansion. This was illustrated in a prospective study which found that the rates of postoperative pulmonary complications in an IPPB-treated group were similar to those in patients receiving incentive spirometry or voluntary deep breathing exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, 18 percent of the IPPB-treated group required discontinuation of therapy due to abdominal distension. In addition, IPPB is more costly than other methods of lung expansion. Thus, it should not be used for routine prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuous positive airway pressure</strong> &ndash; Postoperative continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) offers the potential advantage of being effort-independent. It appears to be as effective as other lung expansion maneuvers, and can be used intermittently or continuously in patients who are unable to adequately perform effort dependent measures to increase postoperative lung volumes. In a trial that randomly chose 500 patients to receive prophylactic nasal CPAP (CPAP at 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O continuously for six hours) or the institution's usual care (CPAP at 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for 10 minutes every four hours) after cardiac surgery, continuous (&ge;6 hours) CPAP improved oxygenation and reduced the incidence of pneumonia, reintubation, and admission to an ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of postoperative CPAP following major abdominal surgery found low quality evidence of a reduction in atelectasis, pneumonia and reintubation, but uncertain benefits on mortality, hypoxia, and invasive ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Further research is needed to determine the role of CPAP in the primary prevention of pulmonary complications among postoperative patients in general and those with a high risk of complications (eg, obesity, sleep-disordered breathing). It may be particularly beneficial in patients who are unable to cooperate with effort dependent strategies to increase lung volumes such as deep breathing exercises or incentive spirometry. Intermittent CPAP may be associated with complications, including patient discomfort, gastric distension, hypoventilation, difficulty clearing respiratory secretions, and barotrauma. Measures to improve tolerance of CPAP are described separately.

A plausible mechanism by which it may work relates to increased lung volumes shortly after surgery with a decrease in the potential for postoperative pulmonary complications. In a small trial (n = 116) of patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer, outcomes were evaluated before and after a protocol that included structured mobilization by nursing staff and walking supervised by a physical therapist beginning on the first postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Using a broad definition, postoperative pulmonary complications were fewer among patients who received early mobilization (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-1.20).</p><p>In a second trial of patients undergoing high risk abdominal surgery, postoperative pulmonary complications increased with each additional day of delay before beginning mobilization (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-8.0 per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate postoperative pain control may help to minimize postoperative pulmonary complications by enabling earlier ambulation and improving the patient's ability to take deep breaths. This is particularly important after thoracic and upper abdominal surgery. Studies of the effect of postoperative pain management on pulmonary complications have focused on the use of epidural analgesia and intercostal nerve blocks as alternatives to more traditional parenteral opioids.</p><p>Postoperative pain control has been consistently improved with epidural analgesia compared with parenteral opioids, although results have been mixed with regard to reduction in postoperative pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>].

The authors identified two meta-analyses, two subsequent randomized controlled trials, and two observational studies of administrative databases. The relative risks for respiratory failure for patients receiving epidural analgesia ranged from 0.5 to 0.77 among these studies. Comparable rates for postoperative pneumonia ranged from 0.38 to 1.46. The authors concluded that thoracic epidural analgesia reduces postoperative pulmonary complication rates, particularly after high-risk surgery, including abdominal aortic and coronary bypass surgeries.</p><p>In a subsequent observational study, investigators restricted their analysis to patients with COPD undergoing major abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In this report, epidural analgesia was associated with a reduction in postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9) that persisted after propensity score matching to adjust for potential confounders.</p><p>Intercostal nerve blocks have been investigated in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery. In a study of 417 patients, for example, intercostal blocks reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in those who had subcostal but not midline abdominal incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. This benefit was seen only in patients under the age of 50 years. A second uncontrolled study of 76 unselected patients undergoing cholecystectomy who received a continuous postoperative intercostal nerve block reported no postoperative pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In the above meta-analysis, intercostal nerve blocks reduced pulmonary complication rates, but the differences were not statistically significant and risk ratios overlapped one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasogastric tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of studies comparing routine use of a nasogastric tube (NGT) to decompress the stomach after abdominal surgery with performing NGT placement only in patients who develop a need for decompression postoperatively concluded that the routine use of an NGT significantly increased postoperative pulmonary complications including pneumonia (relative risk [RR] 1.7) and atelectasis (RR 1.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A subsequent systematic review similarly found a trend toward increased pulmonary complications (combined endpoint of pneumonia and atelectasis) with routine postoperative use of an NGT (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 0.98-1.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].
