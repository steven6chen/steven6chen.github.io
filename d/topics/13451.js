(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-elective-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-general-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for elective percutaneous coronary intervention: General use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, periprocedural bleeding is a frequent complication of PCI, and its frequency and severity is related in part to the intensity of antithrombotic therapy. Initially, periprocedural bleeding was viewed as a relatively benign consequence, but data have linked the occurrence of bleeding and its treatment (ie, blood transfusion) to increased short- and long-term mortality.</p><p>This topic reviews most aspects of periprocedural bleeding among patients undergoing PCI. Gastrointestinal bleeding in this setting is discussed separately.

However, some studies have including episodes of bleeding that occur during the index hospitalization. Estimates of the incidence of periprocedural bleeding during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) lack precision due to the use of different definitions. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> below.) In addition, relevant data come from differing patient populations who were treated with varying regimens of adjunctive pharmacology. Early studies of adjunctive pharmacology in PCI utilized definitions that were extrapolated from fibrinolytic trials (such as the TIMI and GUSTO scales). These early definitions focused on occurrence of intracranial bleeds or large drops in hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In other studies, the definitions of major bleeding have included less severe, but still clinically significant, bleeds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71353%7ECARD%2F77838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71353 graphicRef77838 \">table 1A-B</a>) such as the need for transfusion, bleeding requiring surgical intervention, prolonging hospital stay, or cardiac tamponade.</p><p>The heterogeneity in the definition of major bleeding at the time of PCI creates difficulty in conducting and interpreting the results of clinical research. For example, the relative safety (with regard to bleeding) of different antithrombotic agents may be difficult to ascertain when the combined safety end points across trials have different components. In an attempt to overcome this problem, there has been an attempt to develop a universal definition of bleeding. In 2011, the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) published a consensus classification for bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77838 \">table 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. BARC has been prospectively validated and BARC type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding is associated with increased one- and two-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition, BARC has a comparable predictive ability to the TIMI, GUSTO, and REPLACE-2 scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While not universally accepted, BARC provides a contemporary standard and has been commonly used in clinical trials published after 2013. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients enrolled in randomized trials and registries of adjunctive pharmacology for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the incidence of major periprocedural bleeding ranged from 3 to 6 percent in reports published through 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

Consistent baseline predictors are age greater than 75 years, female sex, lower body weight, and baseline comorbidities such as anemia and chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The reasons for the predilection among women are not clear; some studies have suggested this relation becomes less evident after correction for sex-specific baseline differences such as weight, while others demonstrate a strong relation between female sex and vascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>A retrospective analysis of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-agents-in-acute-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet agents in acute non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>) evaluated potential risk factors for serious bleeding (defined as both TIMI major and TIMI minor bleeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition to those mentioned above, the following were identified: glycoprotein (GP) <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitor use, duration of the pharmacologic intervention, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and arterial hypertension.</p><p>The most common periprocedural factors are sheath size, procedural duration, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, complexity of the intervention, and intensity and complexity of the antithrombotic regimen.

A prognostic risk score for major bleeding during PCI has been developed with data from the REPLACE-1 and REPLACE-2 trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50176\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50176 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23</a>].

While this prognostic score examined only patients with femoral access and has yet to be validated in less selected, &quot;real world&quot; registries, this assessment nevertheless does allow identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from relatively closer observation after PCI. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antithrombotic agents are used during percutaneous coronary intervention to decrease the risk of ischemic events.

As mentioned above, femoral artery, gastrointestinal tract, and retroperitoneal space are the most common locations for major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Closed cavity bleeding, such as in the cranium or pericardial space, is less common but may be immediately life-threatening.

However, in obese patients, a large femoral artery bleed may be difficult to diagnose by physical examination. Ultrasound normally suffices for evaluation and can be used to guide therapy (eg, thrombin injection for pseudoaneurysm). Retroperitoneal bleeding usually is associated with femoral access above the inguinal ligament, posterior wall femoral puncture, or inadvertent perforation of the aortoiliac vessels with guidewire or catheter advancement. Retroperitoneal bleeding may present as hypotension and bradycardia during sheath removal (it may be mistaken for hypervagotonia).</p><p>Important remote site bleeding can occur within the cranium, thorax, or abdomen. Early diagnosis requires considering the possibility.

Back pain and hypotension are common. We prefer angiography using femoral access (if possible) to secure the diagnosis and to potentially facilitate catheter-based treatment. Angiography can be used to facilitate the diagnosis but is also very important to control the hemorrhage with balloon inflation proximal to the site of hemorrhage. In life-threatening bleeding, inflation of a balloon placed from the contra lateral groin into the proximal iliac artery above the site of bleeding is life-saving. CT is an alternative for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal bleeding if the diagnosis is considered after the femoral catheters have been removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261541676\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant periprocedural bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract usually occurs in patients with prior gastrointestinal lesions, such as gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastritis, or colonic polyps.

The rate and expected duration of bleeding, as well as the cardiovascular instability of the patient, should be considered in decision making. We feel that there is insufficient evidence to recommend specific hemoglobin (or hematocrit) targets for patients who have undergone PCI.</p><p>For patients with periprocedural bleeding and who have severe symptoms of angina or dyspnea (class &ge;III or lifestyle impairment) or have evidence of myocardial ischemia despite revascularization, it is reasonable to transfuse when the hemoglobin falls below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Transfusion may be reasonable at higher hemoglobin levels in patients for whom the rate of bleeding is fast and likely to continue. The clinical threshold for transfusion may be lower in those with acute coronary syndromes, as the risk of anemia appears to be greater in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/13,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,72</a>]. In the absence of such findings, the net benefit may be minimal with significant potential for harm. One exception may be an asymptomatic patient who is at high risk from rebleeding from a noncompressible site, in whom a greater reserve of red cell mass may be desired.</p><p>In a Canadian study of 357 critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease, a restrictive transfusion policy (transfusion for hgb &lt;7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> in comparison to a liberal policy (transfusion for hgb &lt;10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> was associated with less multiorgan dysfunction but no difference in 30-day mortality (23 percent for both groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. The authors did report a trend toward less 30-day survival in the restrictive policy group among the patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina (21 percent versus 26 percent), but this difference was not significant. In a separate study of patients with acute coronary syndromes, the predicted probability of 30-day death was higher with transfusion at nadir hematocrit values above 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

The cause of adverse outcomes is often multifactorial and includes the local effects of the bleed, excess patient morbidity that is frequently present in those who bleed, and potential harm from therapy taken to address occurrence of bleeding.
