Successful treatment requires prompt transfer of the snakebite victim to definitive medical care, careful clinical assessment, and timely administration of antivenom in selected patients. Consultation with a medical toxicologist or other physician with experience in managing poisonous snakebites is recommended prior to antivenom administration. Phone consultation with a medical toxicologist is available through a United States regional poison control center by calling 1-800-222-1222. For clinicians outside of the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides a listing of international poison centers on its <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6599\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p>The clinical evaluation and management of coral snakebites is reviewed here.

Throughout the Americas, coral snakebites are uncommon, ranging from 2 bites per year in Argentina to less than 100 bites per year in the southern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In Central American, Colombia, and Brazil, &lt;1 to 2 percent of all snakebites are attributed to coral snakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Most bites involve <em>Micrurus</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. As an example, <em>Micrurus fulvius fulvius</em> (eastern coral snake) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98341 \">picture 1</a>) and <em>Micrurus fulvius tenere</em> (Texas coral snake) account for almost all bites reported in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Envenomation is most notable for causing neurologic symptoms. Fatalities from coral snake envenomation are rare but have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Coral snakes are also found outside of the Americas, including Asia and southern Africa. Neurotoxicity with bites by these snakes is possible but rarely described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533705871\"><span class=\"h1\">CORAL SNAKE CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appearance, venom apparatus, and venom actions for coral snakes are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Appearance</strong> &ndash; Coral snakes have small, oblong heads, lack a pit, and have short hollow fangs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. They can be identified by their brightly colored bands. Banding patterns can sometimes help distinguish coral snakes from similar nonvenomous snakes. As an example, venomous coral snakes within the United States and northern Mexico have red and yellow bands adjacent to each other (remembered by the phrase &quot;red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, friend of Jack&quot; or &quot;venom lack&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98341 \">picture 1</a>). However, color intensity and banding patterns are variable and in other parts of the Americas can be reversed (red bands adjacent to black bands). In Mexico (south of Mexico city), Central America, and South America, some coral snakes are red and black and several species of snakes without neurotoxic venom closely mimic the banding of coral snakes. Rarely, coral snakes can be all black or albino.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Misidentification (particularly in an emergency situation) may have potentially serious outcomes if a coral snake is mistaken for a nonvenomous snake. Thus, patients bitten by a banded snake in the geographic regions where coral snakes reside should be observed closely for an extended period of time before envenomation is excluded. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venom apparatus and requirements for envenomation</strong> &ndash; Coral snakes deliver venom through fixed hollow fangs located in the anterior maxilla. Envenomation requires that the snake chew on its victim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because the other teeth in the snake&rsquo;s mouth are rear-facing, once the snake becomes attached, it can be difficult to remove.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most coral snakes play dead or retreat as a first response to a threat. Thus, a coral snakebite typically results from harassment by a human or companion animal such as a curious dog or excessive handling of a snake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venom mechanism of toxicity</strong> &ndash; Coral snake venom causes neurotoxicity by competitive inhibition of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Pre- and postsynaptic binding has been described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rarely, local tissue damage, direct muscle toxicity, and coagulopathy in addition to neurotoxicity have been reported with bites by selected species of coral snakes (eg, <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136670103\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a coral snakebite is reported or suspected, the clinician should determine the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where and when the bite occurred</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A description of the snake if the snake has not been brought in or photographed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How the bite occurred and whether there was more than one bite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any signs or symptoms and the timing of onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment and first aid that was provided, including timing of first aid </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any recent ethanol or recreational drug use that may modify the patient&rsquo;s presentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pertinent past medical history, such as current medications (especially anticoagulants or beta blockers), any prior snakebites for which antivenom was given, or allergy to animals used in antivenom production (eg, horses, sheep, rabbits)</p><p/><p>Coral snakebites frequently occur after intentional handling of the snake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>]. Most victims are male, and many patients are intoxicated at the time of the bite. In some cases, the coral snake is mistaken for other banded snakes (eg, king snake or milk snake). In other instances, the patient is bitten while trying to kill the snake. In tropical regions, snakebites may also occur when farmers encounter snakes in the fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients may report mild pain and swelling or paresthesias at the bite site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1,3,5,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,9,11,12</a>]. Initial systemic symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or dizziness. Patients with neurotoxicity may complain of double vision, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, or generalized weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136670183\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs of coral snake envenomation include salivation, drowsiness, euphoria, and descending muscle weakness that typically manifests as bulbar paralysis including ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Generalized muscle weakness can cause respiratory depression or failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The onset of neurotoxicity may be delayed for up to 12 hours. Rarely, seizures may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In most patients, pain at the bite site is minimal or absent. Although swelling at the bite site may be present, it is usually less pronounced than in patients with pit viper envenomations. Significant local tissue damage and coagulopathy are <strong>not</strong> typical of coral snake envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, severe local pain, myolysis, and coagulopathy in addition to delayed neurotoxicity has been described after envenomation by <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em> which is found in Central and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136670756\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with limited local symptoms, no signs of coagulopathy, and in whom a bite by <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em> can be reliably excluded, assessment for coagulopathy and rhabdomyolysis is not needed.</p><p>If a bite by <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em> is confirmed, or if the patient is bitten by a banded snake and is displaying signs of significant local pain, muscle pain, or bleeding that is atypical for most coral snakes then the following studies should be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> &ndash; Clotting parameters should be measured as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complete blood count with platelets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prothrombin time <span class=\"nowrap\">(PT)/International</span> normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fibrinogen (only direct fibrinogen measurement is reliable; derived fibrinogen is not reliable in snakebite)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Fibrin/Fibrinogen</span> degradation products or D-dimer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rhabdomyolysis &ndash; </strong>Studies helpful in identifying rhabdomyolysis include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapid urine dipstick for blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urine for myoglobin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Microscopic urinalysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum creatine kinase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>12-lead electrocardiogram</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672335412\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the decision to perform endotracheal intubation and institute mechanical ventilation should be made on clinical grounds (including the need for airway protection associated with bulbar palsy), ancillary studies may provide additional objective information to augment serial clinical assessment in some patients.

Continuous pulse oximetry is advisable, but is insensitive for the detection of respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary function testing</strong> &ndash; Serial measurements of pulmonary function, especially maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC), can identify the presence and degree of respiratory muscle weakness. Serial measures of pulmonary function (instead of using one measure at one point in time) can be used as rough guidelines, especially when the respiratory decline is acute in children under six years of age. MIP can be obtained even when a lack of cooperation does not allow measurement of MEP or FVC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;, section on 'Interpretation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Assess need for ventilatory support'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ventilatory support is indicated when the FVC is less than 50 percent of predicted, when the MIP is less negative than -30 cmH2O (eg, -20 cmH2O), or when the MEP is below 40 cmH2O. The diminished MIP indicates a high risk for hypercapnia, while the low MEP indicates inadequate cough strength and risk for secretion retention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Capnography</strong> &ndash; Capnography measures end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and respiratory rate with each breath in spontaneously breathing patients. Continuous capnography provides instantaneous feedback on the clinical status of the patient and can provide early detection of hypercarbia in victims of coral snake envenomation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'Acute respiratory distress'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood gas measurement</strong> &ndash; Arterial or venous blood gas may also be used to assess the degree of respiratory acidosis in patients with weakness or declining clinical status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders#H12584090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Respiratory acidosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1672335462\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a coral snakebite is typically straightforward because it often results from direct handling of a banded snake that must often be forcibly removed, as coral snakes frequently adhere tightly to the bite site. A digital photograph or verified snake specimen helps to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>Coral snake envenomation causes a descending flaccid paralysis that may occur up to 12 hours after the bite. Descending paralysis is also seen with other neurotoxic snakes (eg, the Mojave rattlesnake), myasthenia gravis, botulism and paralytic shellfish poisoning. Food history, for example, ingestion of shellfish (especially non-commercially harvested bivalve mollusks) or home canned foods, differentiates these toxic causes of paralysis from a coral snakebite.

(See <a href=\"#H1672335412\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory function'</a> above.)</p><p>For suspected coral snake envenomation, serial detailed neurologic examinations should be performed hourly for at least 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-coral-snakebites/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Important clinical findings include the presence of motor weakness, particularly involving cranial nerves and resulting in ptosis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, and dysarthria. The clinician should also assess the patient&rsquo;s ability to protect his or her airway and maintain adequate respiratory ventilation. Once neurologic signs of motor weakness occur, progression to respiratory paralysis can be rapid and more frequent monitoring of respiratory function and physical examination may be necessary.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the risk of progressive neuromuscular weakness with respiratory failure, victims of coral snakebites should have serial clinical assessment of respiratory muscle strength and serial measurement of pulmonary function, noninvasive capnography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood gas measurement. (See <a href=\"#H1672335412\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with limited local symptoms, no signs of coagulopathy, and in whom a bite by <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em> can be reliably excluded based upon region in which the bite occurred or snake identification, assessment for coagulopathy and rhabdomyolysis is <strong>not</strong> needed. However, when a bite by <em>Micrurus lemniscatus halleri</em> is confirmed, or when the patient is bitten by a banded snake but is displaying signs of significant local pain, muscle pain, or bleeding that is atypical for most coral snakes then appropriate studies to evaluate for coagulopathy and rhabdomyolysis should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H1136670756\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinical evidence of ventilatory failure or who are in danger of aspiration due to inability to handle oral secretions warrant prompt endotracheal intubation.

When deciding whether to administer antivenom, clinicians who are unfamiliar with the management of snakebite should seek expert consultation with a clinical toxinologist, poison control center, or physician experienced in management of snakebites in the region. (See <a href=\"#H1136671021\" class=\"local\">'Antivenom'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all locations, we recommend that all patients with clinical findings that indicate coral snake envenomation receive antivenom rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H28925053\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In regions outside of the United States where antivenom is readily available, we suggest that asymptomatic patients who have definitely sustained a coral snakebite receive antivenom (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In the United States, because of the scarcity of approved antivenom, the recommended approach is to <strong>not</strong> administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=north-american-coral-snake-micrurus-fulvius-antivenom-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">North American coral snake antivenom</a> to asymptomatic patients with likely or confirmed Texas or Eastern coral snakebite. (See <a href=\"#H28925053\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coral snake antivenoms, especially older, poorly purified, equine IgG antivenoms, are potentially associated with severe allergic reactions; it should only be administered in a continuously monitored emergency or intensive care unit settings. The initial dose of antivenom varies by manufacturer and specific type of coral snakebite being treated. It does <strong>not</strong> differ between adults and children. For specific antivenom dosing, the clinician should refer to the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions for use and local guidelines. (See <a href=\"#H28928530\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should immediately stop antivenom infusion in patients who experience signs of acute hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylactic shock, oropharyngeal swelling, bronchospasm, urticaria). These patients should receive treatment for anaphylaxis as outlined in the rapid overviews for anaphylaxis in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 2</a>) and in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1136671021\" class=\"local\">'Antivenom'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In settings where antivenom is <strong>not</strong> available, administration of expired or alternative antivenoms is <strong>not</strong> appropriate in asymptomatic patients. Administration of expired or alternative antivenoms to patients with neurotoxicity or systemic effects should <strong>only</strong> occur after consultation with a regional poison control center and a medical toxicologist. (See <a href=\"#H28928621\" class=\"local\">'Expired or alternative antivenoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus prophylaxis should be administered to snakebite patients according to the recommended immunization schedule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>). In the rare instance of coral snake envenomation with coagulopathy, tetanus prophylaxis should be postponed until after antivenom therapy and normalization of clotting function. We discourage the use of prophylactic antibiotics in coral snakebite victims.
