It is characterized by episodes of severe headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, and abdominal pain, and is relieved by sleep.</p><p>The management of migraine consists of general measures, abortive treatment, and preventive treatment. An individual patient may need all three approaches. Unfortunately, there are limited data from high quality randomized controlled trials regarding the treatment of migraine in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Thus, most management recommendations are based upon experience in adults, as well as expert opinion.</p><p>The acute treatment of migraine in children is reviewed here. Other aspects of pediatric migraine are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of migraine in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of migraine in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General precepts of acute migraine treatment include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating the child and family about migraine headache is an important aspect of care. A headache calendar may identify triggering factors, clarify features of the attacks, and help evaluate the effectiveness of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Precipitating factors (eg, stress, poor sleep habits, irregular meals, odors, weather changes, specific foods, menstrual cycles), if identified, should be avoided if possible. A headache diary suitable for children can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.childrenshospital.org/~/media/healthtopics-kidsmd/conditions/headaches/hadiary.ashx?la=en&amp;token=JiTJIKzni6Vw8R2BTB/kglnSMc1cFToWaABUTp7bFXd1TzXjB3XPuOM/fl28pvcdTURj6JPpCt6yQnzREeJholY0f2CxWf8PrkqQEQj0+8KU12LX8L1PyoDd2YtiOEto&amp;TOPIC_ID=6168\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When migraine symptoms develop, the child should rest or sleep in a dark, quiet room with a cool cloth applied to the forehead. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications useful for the acute treatment of migraine range from analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> to triptans, antiemetics, and the less commonly used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dihydroergotamine</a>. Abortive medications are usually more effective if they are given early in the course of the headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine-specific drugs (eg, triptans) are useful for more severe migraine and for headaches that respond poorly to over the counter analgesics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral agents may be ineffective because of poor absorption secondary to migraine-induced gastric stasis. Thus, a nonoral route of administration (ie, rectal, nasal spray, or injection) may be better for some children whose migraines present with significant nausea or vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication overuse headache should be avoided by limiting specific analgesics to no more than two days per week. Opiates, barbiturates, and triptans are the most likely analgesics to result in medication overuse headache. Educating families about this risk and using preventive (prophylactic) medications in patients with frequent headaches can decrease medication overuse headache.</p><p/><p>Because of the paucity of definitive data in children, the management of pediatric migraine headache varies among clinicians. The sections that follow describe one potential approach for different clinical situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603540734\"><span class=\"h2\">Young children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early use of medication is an important principle of acute treatment. This may be difficult in young children, who often do not report a migraine until symptoms are severe. The younger the child, the more challenging it is to treat migraine effectively with abortive medication. Therefore, the treatment plan should be straightforward and safe. The parents typically decide when treatment is indicated and when to administer medication. In general, young children are not able to medicate themselves and often are unable to swallow pills; in such cases, a liquid preparation is required but may not be tolerated because of nausea and vomiting. In the school-age child, arrangements must be made for a school professional to administer medicine. The directions should include specific guidelines for the school. Often the school requires the parents to sign a permission form to treat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603540740\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild to moderate attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mild to moderate migraine attacks not associated with vomiting or severe nausea, analgesics (NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>) or combination analgesics are first choice agents because they are effective, less expensive, and less likely to cause adverse effects than migraine-specific agents such as triptans. When mild to moderate attacks are associated with severe nausea or vomiting, an oral or rectal antiemetic drug can be used in conjunction with simple or combination analgesics.</p><p>For children with acute migraine headache, we suggest initial abortive treatment with an analgesic, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, both of which have proven efficacy for migraine in children in randomized, controlled trials. The initial choice depends upon individual preference. If the patient does not respond to one, the other can be tried. Ibuprofen is given in an initial dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. This dose may be repeated in four to six hours if needed. No more than four doses should be given in 24 hours (maximum daily dose 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. Alternatively, acetaminophen can be given in a dose of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum dose 1000 mg). This may be repeated in two to four hours if symptoms persist but should not exceed three doses in 24 hours.</p><p>Early use of an antiemetic may relieve symptoms and facilitate sleep if nausea and vomiting are prominent. For children with acute migraine who have nausea and vomiting, we suggest rectal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">promethazine</a> in a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> as needed at intervals of four to six hours. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603540747\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate to severe attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For moderate to severe migraine attacks, analgesics may still be effective, but oral migraine-specific agents (triptans) should be considered. Therefore, for children who have acute migraine headache without vomiting that is refractory to analgesics, we suggest treatment with an oral triptan or the combination of a triptan and a NSAID. One frequently used agent is oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a>, which can be started at 25 mg, with a maximum dose of 100 mg. This can be repeated in two hours if needed. Based upon the author&rsquo;s clinical experience, children older than 10 years of age and who weigh more than 50 kg seem to tolerate adult doses of the triptans. Children between 6 to 10 years of age and who weigh less than 50 kg should begin with the smallest available dose of triptan, such as sumatriptan 5 mg nasal spray or the 25 mg tablet.</p><p>For children who are unable to swallow pills, alternatives include the oral disintegrating tablet formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rizatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rizatriptan</a> (5 or 10 mg wafer) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolmitriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">zolmitriptan</a> (2.5 or 5 mg), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=almotriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">almotriptan</a> tablet (6.25 or 12.5 mg). For children age five years and older, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> nasal spray due to its proven efficacy in randomized, controlled trials in adolescents. In addition, it is generally more tolerable to children than an injection. Sumatriptan nasal spray can be started with a 5 mg dose and repeated once in four to six hours for patients with initial improvement followed by worsening headache. We suggest similar doses of nasal spray in older children, with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg. One drawback to nasal sumatriptan is the associated bad taste, which limits its acceptability in children. This problem can be mitigated by having children suck on a piece of hard candy.</p><p>For children and adolescents who have acute migraine headache who do not respond to monotherapy with other abortive migraine medications, we suggest treatment with a combination of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naproxen</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose), or oral sumatriptan combined with another NSAID.</p><p>When complicated by vomiting or severe nausea, severe migraine attacks can be treated with nonoral migraine-specific medications including subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a>, nasal sumatriptan and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolmitriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">zolmitriptan</a>, and antiemetic agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603540754\"><span class=\"h2\">Variable attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with migraine have attacks that vary in severity, time of onset, and association with vomiting and nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These patients may require two or more options for the management of acute migraine, including oral medications for mild to moderate attacks and nonoral medications (eg, subcutaneous or nasal triptans) for more severe attacks or those associated with vomiting or severe nausea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603540761\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with migraine in emergency settings generally have unusually severe or long-lasting attacks, and in many cases their customary acute migraine treatment has failed to provide relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The treatment of migraine attacks in the emergency department or other urgent care settings follows the same principles as treatment in nonurgent settings outlined above (see <a href=\"#H603540740\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate attacks'</a> above and <a href=\"#H603540747\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe attacks'</a> above), with the obvious difference that parenteral medications are more readily available.</p><p>For children who present in emergency or urgent care settings and fail to improve with analgesics, oral triptans, or other measures outlined earlier for moderate to severe migraine attacks (see <a href=\"#H603540747\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe attacks'</a> above), the following are reasonable options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our clinical experience, the most effective option is intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, such as 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of normal saline, given with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prochlorperazine</a> (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> to a maximum dose of 10 mg) followed by IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketorolac</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> up to a maximum of 30 mg).

Acute symptomatic medications used to treat headaches have the potential for causing MOH. However, the degree of risk differs depending upon the specific medication or class of medications. Based upon the literature and clinical experience, the risk for MOH appears to be highest with opioids, butalbital-containing combination analgesics, and triptans. The risk with triptans is considered intermediate by some experts but high by others. The risk is lowest with NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Causal medications'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of medication overuse headache should be suspected in patients who have frequent headaches despite the regular use of analgesic medications. The treatment involves patient education, withdrawal of the offending medication, bridge (transitional) therapy aimed at symptomatic relief during medication withdrawal, establishment of an appropriate headache treatment regimen covering acute and preventive care, and relapse prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To avoid the development of MOH, most acute medications should be limited to less than 10 days per month (or less than 15 days per month for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> and NSAIDs), and preventive therapies should be used as the mainstay in patients with frequent headaches (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in children&quot;</a>). Families and children should be encouraged to record the frequency and amount of analgesic used in a headache diary (log) or calendar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abortive (symptomatic) therapy of migraine ranges from the use of analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> to triptans, antiemetics, or the less commonly used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dihydroergotamine</a>.

Educating the child and family about migraine headache is an important aspect of care. A headache calendar can help identify triggering factors, clarify features of the attacks, and document response to treatment. Precipitating factors, if identified, should be avoided. When symptoms develop, have the child rest or sleep in a quiet dark room. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with acute migraine headache, we suggest initial abortive treatment with an analgesic, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If the patient does not respond to one, the other can be tried. Ibuprofen is given in an initial dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. This dose may be repeated in four to six hours if needed. No more than four doses should be given in 24 hours (maximum daily dose 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. Alternatively, acetaminophen can be given in a dose of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (usually as one or two 325 mg tablets), with a maximum dose of 1000 mg. This may be repeated in two to four hours if symptoms persist but should not exceed three doses in 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H603540740\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate attacks'</a> above and <a href=\"#H603541009\" class=\"local\">'Analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with acute migraine who have nausea and vomiting, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">promethazine</a> (0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> as needed at intervals of four to six hours (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H603540740\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate attacks'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antiemetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children who have acute migraine headache without vomiting that is refractory to analgesics, we suggest initial treatment with oral triptans or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naproxen</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This may include oral sumatriptan starting at 25 mg, with a maximum dose of 50 to 100 mg. Alternatives include the oral disintegrating tablet formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rizatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rizatriptan</a> (5 mg wafer) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolmitriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">zolmitriptan</a> (2.5 or 5 mg), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=almotriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">almotriptan</a> tablet (6.25 or 12.5 mg). For children who are unable to swallow pills or have early nausea or vomiting, we prefer the orally disintegrating tablet formulations of zolmitriptan and rizatriptan. (See <a href=\"#H603540747\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe attacks'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27076669\" class=\"local\">'Oral triptans'</a> above and <a href=\"#H207323099\" class=\"local\">'Sumatriptan plus naproxen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children at least five years of age, if over-the-counter analgesics do not provide relief or if persistent vomiting precludes the use of oral medications, including the orally disintegrating tablet (wafer) triptan formulations, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sumatriptan</a> nasal spray (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We prefer to start with 5 mg and repeat once in four to six hours if initially effective but the headache returns. If there is no benefit, 10 mg nasal spray (two 5 mg units given together) may be tried. We suggest similar doses of nasal spray in older children, with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg. (See <a href=\"#H603540747\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe attacks'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Nasal sumatriptan'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Nasal zolmitriptan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H907652890\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Robert P Cruse, DO, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lewis D, Ashwal S, Hershey A, et al.
