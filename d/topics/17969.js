There is evidence of underlying abnormalities in the nervous system, the immune system, and metabolic function in affected patients. However, diagnosis can be difficult due to the lack of a test with adequate sensitivity and specificity. The long-term prognosis is unpredictable, and only about 15 percent of patients make a full recovery.</p><p>The treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> will be reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of this disorder and the approach to the patient with fatigue are discussed separately.

Management is supportive and focuses on treating common comorbid conditions, which include sleep disorders, pain, depression and anxiety, memory and concentration difficulties, and dizziness and lightheadedness. Counseling therapies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and graded exercise therapy (GET) may be beneficial in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Many controversies remain about the optimal management of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>. Clinicians and patients should be cautious about the use of unproven interventions that are potentially dangerous and often expensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3833475043\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best approach for the clinician is to establish a rapport with the patient to be able to provide support and reassurance.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain to the patient that the severity is variable but can be completely incapacitating and that the symptoms are real. Tell the patient that authoritative institutions, such as the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, have concluded that <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is a real illness; the symptoms are not due to malingering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain that studies have identified underlying abnormalities in the nervous system, the immune system, and metabolic function in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> although their relationship to its etiology is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain that there is no diagnostic test that is accurate enough to prove a person has the illness, which has caused some doctors to question the validity of the illness and may cause some patients to experience feelings of guilt. The patient must believe that you understand they have a real disease or you will not be able to help them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promise to be honest. Patients may be mistrustful because of prior negative experiences, and regaining trust may take a great deal of time. Accept that you may not be able to help all patients with this disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address the issue of specific diagnoses that concern or worry the patient. Many patients are concerned that they may have a terrifying disease, such as cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which has not yet been diagnosed. Try to elicit such unexpressed concerns and then respond to them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain to the patient that this is not a new disease, review the history, and emphasize that we have considerable knowledge and experience with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid debate over the psychogenic versus organic origin of symptoms. This debate does not benefit the patient. If the cause is psychologic, the symptoms are no less real (a difficult concept for some patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their families); if the cause is organic, we do not yet know how to find it or treat it. In one study, belief in a viral cause of the illness was associated with prolonged functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address common symptoms and treat any comorbid conditions that may exacerbate them.

(See <a href=\"#H284171727\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of studies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT can be effective in some patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) and may be useful in those with idiopathic chronic fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. CBT can also be beneficial for common symptoms such as sleep disturbances and pain. This approach typically involves a series of one-hour sessions designed to alter beliefs and behaviors that could exacerbate symptoms. It is important to note that endorsement of CBT does not reflect a belief that the illness is purely psychological; a number of chronic medical conditions benefit from CBT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862147\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a>.)</p><p>Most studies suggest that CBT can improve fatigue symptoms and function in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-16</a>], although there are several limitations of the available studies (see <a href=\"#H284171727\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of studies'</a> below). CBT has compared favorably with other interventions, including usual care, adaptive pacing therapy, relaxation training, and support group participation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large randomized trial that included 641 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> who all received specialist medical care, CBT was compared with GET, adaptive pacing therapy (helping the patient to plan and pace activities to reduce fatigue), and no additional therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therapy consisted of 14 sessions during the first 23 weeks and an additional session at 36 weeks. At one year, CBT resulted in lower fatigue scores (3.4 points lower on a 33 point scale, 95% CI 1.8 to 5.0) and higher physical function scores (7.1 points higher on a 100 point scale, 95% CI 2.0 to 12.1) compared with medical care alone. This difference was deemed moderate by the trial authors. CBT also resulted in more favorable scores compared with adaptive pacing therapy but not compared with GET.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were observed in a randomized trial that compared CBT with relaxation training in 60 patients, with CBT resulting in higher rates of improved function and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The benefit persisted at five years following the intervention, as assessed by an interviewer blinded to the original assignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another trial of 278 patients, those randomly assigned to CBT had greater improvements in fatigue severity and functional impairment at 14 months compared with those assigned to support group participation or no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Other formats for CBT administration, such as a group setting or over the internet, also appear to be effective:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one randomized trial, group CBT was more effective than enhanced usual care (defined as management by a primary care clinician or medical specialist) at improving physical functioning, bodily pain, and vitality at 16 months among patients with a variety of somatic syndromes, including <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID;</span> the patients who received group CBT participated in nine 3.5-hour sessions over four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 135 adolescents with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> internet-based CBT was associated with improvements in all three primary outcomes at six months compared with usual care (which involved face-to-face CBT, rehabilitation treatment, GET, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alternative treatments); the outcomes included full school attendance (75 versus 16 percent), absence of severe fatigue (85 versus 27 percent), and normal physical functioning (78 versus 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, the clinician should be aware that the term &ldquo;graded exercise therapy&rdquo; (GET), which refers to structured progressive levels of activity, is not well received by some <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> patients.</p><p>A strategy for exercise therapy includes establishment of a baseline of achievable patient-specific exercise or physical activity, usually determined by or in mutual decision with the patient, followed by a gradual, incremental increase in the duration of time spent physically active. We encourage patients to gently push themselves but emphasize that they should not try to do too much, even if they happen to have much more energy one day. The objective is not an immediate return to baseline functioning but rather maintenance of a slowly progressive level of activity. Overall, the type and amount of exercise should be discussed and individualized with each patient.</p><p>A target heart rate range should be set to avoid overexertion, generally &lt;100 beats per minute. Patients should aim for a goal of 30 minutes of light exercise five times a week, after which the intensity and aerobic nature of the exercise can be gradually increased. Any titratable sustainable activity is appropriate, including walking, swimming, and the use of exercise machines, and activities can be mixed. GET should be supervised by a physical therapist or exercise therapist.</p><p>Overall, the data support some benefit to GET, but there are several limitations of the available studies. (See <a href=\"#H284171727\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of studies'</a> below.)</p><p>A 2017 systematic review of eight randomized controlled trials involving 1518 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> found low- to moderate-quality evidence that exercise therapy (eg, walking, swimming, cycling, dancing) of 12 to 26 weeks&rsquo; duration was associated with reduced fatigue compared with other management strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In general, exercise therapy improved physical functioning, sleep, and self-rating of overall health. Most studies had participants exercise at home between three and five times per week with a duration of 5 to 15 minutes per session.</p><p>Prolonged lack of exercise in patients exacerbates physical weakness, and adherence to GET alone can be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/12,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21-23</a>]. In a large randomized trial that included 641 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> who all received specialist medical care, GET resulted in lower fatigue scores (3.2 points lower on a 33 point scale, 95% CI 1.8 to 5.0) and higher physical function scores (9.4 points higher on a 100 point scale, 95% CI 2.0 to 12.1) compared with medical care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This difference was deemed moderate by the trial authors. GET also resulted in more favorable scores compared with adaptive pacing therapy but not compared with CBT.A subsequent trial suggested that self-guided GET with less intense therapist involvement also improved fatigue and function modestly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although exercise can worsen symptoms temporarily, deconditioning can do so on a sustained basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. Although reports of patient surveys have suggested worse outcomes with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], this has not been described in systematic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one report, women with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> had low normal fitness on treadmill testing compared with normal controls, despite no indication of cardiopulmonary abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, maximal treadmill testing did not result in a major exacerbation of fatigue or other symptoms. In another controlled trial, more patients rated themselves better after they completed a graded exercise regimen than after flexibility treatment (15 of 29 versus 8 of 30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, patients to whom a graded exercise program was recommended generally did better than those for whom no exercise regimen was suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Nevertheless, in some trials, withdrawal rates were higher for GET than other non-activity based interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and in one trial more patients had serious adverse events with activity-based therapy (including GET and adaptive pacing) compared with usual care (8 and 9 percent versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Independent reviewers reportedly thought these were not treatment-related.</p><p>Some clinicians advocate adaptive pacing therapy rather than GET although there is no uniform definition of pacing as a treatment technique, the supportive clinical data for that approach are mainly limited to observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], and, in the trial discussed above, it was not as effective as GET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284171727\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is inherently difficult to study because there is no international consensus on the case definition, patient symptoms can vary over time, and outcome measures are usually subjective in the absence of an accurate objective marker of disease severity.</p><p>In particular, differences in case definitions used in various studies or trials makes assessment of the outcomes difficult. In 2016, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published an addendum to their original systematic review of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> treatment, which examined the effect of the least specific (Oxford) case definition on study results and the impact of separating studies of CBT from other counseling and behavioral interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. On reanalyzing data from studies that used a stricter case definition, CBT decreased fatigue (low strength of evidence) but did not affect quality of life (also low strength of evidence), and there was insufficient evidence on impact on function, employment, and global improvement. With regards to GET, there was only one small trial that used a stricter case definition so the evidence on outcomes was deemed insufficient.</p><p>Other methodologic questions have been raised about a number of published trials. As an example, the randomized trial that demonstrated better subjective outcomes with CBT and GET than usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] has been criticized not only for using an inclusion criteria that was too broad for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> but also for using thresholds of improvement that deviated from the published trial protocol and may have inflated outcomes, for telling study participants that CBT and GET were beneficial during the course of the study, and for the lack of objective outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Because of these and other concerns, some clinicians and advocates in the <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> community reject the role of GET and, to a lesser extent, CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Nevertheless, given the overall consistent findings from clinical trials, despite the limitations we believe that the cumulative body of evidence does support at least a modest benefit of both CBT and GET for some patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> without clear harm when performed appropriately.</p><p>Guidance from national organizations regarding these interventions is somewhat mixed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States removed discussion of CBT or GET from its patient information website, although it suggests avoiding &ldquo;push and crash&rdquo; cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines from 2007 endorsed CBT and GET and noted insufficient evidence to suggest pacing; these are undergoing review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Guidance from a major physicians&rsquo; organization in Alberta, Canada presents both GET and pacing as evidence-based strategies and acknowledges the debate about the relative merits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>It is evident that not all patients will benefit from these interventions, and high-quality studies of these and other strategies for management of <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> are warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF MEDICATIONS AND DIET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a number of medications and special diets have been evaluated in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), none has proved successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/1,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36,37</a>].

A major problem with evaluating the effect of therapy in <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> is that the symptoms fluctuate over time and may remit spontaneously. While placebo treatment can lead to subjective improvement, as with other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the placebo response does not appear to be particularly robust in <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a> &ndash; A controlled trial of intravenous and oral acyclovir was based upon the possible association with Epstein-Barr virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The outcome showed no benefit over placebo. However, acyclovir has much less efficacy against Epstein-Barr virus than against herpes simplex, and therefore little clinical efficacy might have been expected. More important, the study revealed the wide natural fluctuations in severity of illness and the close linkage of mood to the perception of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antidepressants</strong> &ndash; The results of small controlled studies of antidepressant medications have yielded conflicting results. As an example, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> in 96 patients, 45 percent of whom were depressed, showed no benefit of therapy at eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Patients received anakinra (100 mg subcutaneously daily) for four weeks or placebo. There was no significant difference in fatigue between the groups at the end of treatment, or after an additional 20 weeks of follow-up. In addition, there were more injection site reactions in those that received anakinra (68 versus 4 percent). There is no available information on the effectiveness of other cytokine inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=galantamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Galantamine</a> &ndash; Galantamine is a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to treat Alzheimer disease.

However, this finding is in contrast to the more general experience. Controlled trials of intravenous immune globulin yielded conflicting and unimpressive results with a high incidence of adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/42,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48,49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylphenidate</a> &ndash; A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of 60 patients who fulfilled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> evaluated treatment with methylphenidate (10 mg twice daily) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Methylphenidate compared with placebo had a clinically significant effect on fatigue in 17 percent of patients and on concentration in 22 percent of patients.

There were no differences in the primary endpoint, defined as effects on the fatigue score at three months after the intervention. However, a major or moderate response, defined as lasting improvements in self-reported fatigue score during follow-up, was seen in 10 of 15 patients (67 percent) who received rituximab and in 2 of 15 patients (13 percent) who received placebo. The mean duration of response within a one-year follow-up period among the 10 responders in the rituximab group was 25 weeks (range 8 to 44 weeks). There were no differences in B cell levels between patients in the rituximab group who achieved a response compared with those who did not achieve a response. Though intriguing, these findings are too preliminary to support the use of rituximab, a drug that can cause immunosuppression and serious complications. This study needs to be repeated with a larger number of patients.</p><p/><p>There is often a great temptation to give patients empiric treatment with antibiotics, especially if the patient happens to have a positive Lyme serology. It is important to appreciate, however, that a positive Lyme serology does not diagnose Lyme disease, which is a clinical diagnosis.

Clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit of prolonged antimicrobial therapy in persons with fatigue and a positive Lyme serology.

There is evidence of underlying abnormalities in the nervous system, the immune system, and metabolic function in affected patients. However, diagnosis can be difficult due to the lack of a test with adequate sensitivity and specificity. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many therapies have been tried in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> but none is curative. Management is supportive and focused on treating common symptoms and comorbid conditions, which include sleep disorders, pain, depression and anxiety, memory and concentration difficulties, and dizziness and lightheadedness. Counseling therapies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and graded exercise therapy (GET) can be beneficial for some patients, although there are several limitations of the available studies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Management overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H284171727\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CBT has been effective in some patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and may be useful in those with idiopathic chronic fatigue. This approach typically involves a series of one-hour sessions designed to alter beliefs and behaviors that could exacerbate symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prolonged lack of exercise in patients exacerbates physical weakness, and adherence to GET may be beneficial in some patients. The type and amount of exercise should be discussed and individualized with each patient. Many patients experience recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> symptoms after exercise, particularly with aggressive regimens. This can be reduced by the cautious setting of less ambitious exercise goals in combination with patient education. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Exercise therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although a number of medications and special diets have been evaluated in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> none has proved successful.
