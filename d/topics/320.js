They are not monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), cyclic antidepressants (CA), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, most share structural similarities with SSRIs. Although atypical antidepressants manifest fewer side effects than MAOIs and CAs, a few drugs in this class are more toxic than SSRIs in overdose. </p><p>Serotonin is produced by the metabolism of L-tryptophan. It exerts its action by binding to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) receptors, of which there are seven types that are further divided into multiple subtypes. In the central nervous system (CNS), serotonergic neurons are primarily located in the brainstem and assist in the regulation of sleep, affective behavior, food intake, temperature regulation, migraines, emesis, sexual behavior, nociception, and motor tone. In the peripheral nervous system, serotonin plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone and gastrointestinal motility. Although most adverse effects of SNRIs are a direct extension of the pharmacologic effects of serotonin, certain agents have unique toxicities, as outlined below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-poisoning-from-atypical-non-ssri-antidepressants-including-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snri/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>All atypical antidepressants inhibit the reuptake of biogenic amines as part of their mechanism of action. In addition to inhibiting serotonin reuptake, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desvenlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desvenlafaxine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a> all inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a> is chemically characterized as a monocyclic-aminoketone and is unlike any other antidepressant on the market. The parent drug and its metabolites have a weak inhibitory effect on the reuptake of norepinephrine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, with no effect on the reuptake of serotonin. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mirtazapine</a> is a potent presynaptic antagonist of central alpha-adrenoreceptors (alpha-2&gt;alpha-1), promoting monoamine release. Mirtazapine also acts as an antagonist at both 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. Therefore, the released 5-HT is believed to exert its effects primarily on 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors. </p><p>Many of the atypical antidepressants are substrates for and inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and other CYP isoenzymes. As examples, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> are substrates for CYP2D6, while mirtazapine induces CYP3A4. Drug-drug interactions may occur when other medications are taken that act as substrates for the same isoenzymes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425302868\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical antidepressants are rapidly absorbed, and all are metabolized by hepatic enzymes, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88063 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88062\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88062 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88061 \">table 3</a>). This raises concern for drug-drug interactions in patients who take other medications that serve as substrates for hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. All drugs in this class have a large volume of distribution, which affects treatment, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2457053410\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>Several specific kinetic issues warrant mention. Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> have active metabolites, which extends the duration of their effects. Venlafaxine is metabolized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desvenlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desvenlafaxine</a> via the hepatic enzyme cytochrome 2D6 (CYP2D6); as a result, patients with defective CYP2D6 metabolism (known as poor metabolizers) are more likely to develop elevated drug levels and are at increased risk of potential adverse effects. The use of desvenlafaxine in such patients reduces such risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-poisoning-from-atypical-non-ssri-antidepressants-including-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snri/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bupropion has several metabolites with significant pharmacologic activity (eg, hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion).These have plasma concentrations and elimination half-lives that are approximately double that of the parent compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-poisoning-from-atypical-non-ssri-antidepressants-including-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snri/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Although the kinetics of therapeutic dosing are well described, data pertaining to the kinetics of overdose are limited. It is reasonable to assume that in overdose most atypical antidepressants have increased bioavailability and a prolonged half-life, both presumably due to saturation of metabolic pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-poisoning-from-atypical-non-ssri-antidepressants-including-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snri/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54826615\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4156555693\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large majority of atypical antidepressant poisonings cause immediate central nervous system (CNS) toxicity that is only mild to moderate in severity.

The spectrum of possible symptoms and signs associated with serotonin toxicity is broad, and presentations range from benign to lethal. Serotonin syndrome is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serotonin syndrome is characterized by a triad of CNS symptoms, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. In severe cases, patients manifest altered mental status, confusion, agitation, or coma. Autonomic findings may include tachycardia, mydriasis, labile blood pressure, and hyperthermia. Neuromuscular signs include tremor, clonus, nystagmus, and hyperreflexia. Sustained ankle clonus is more often seen with serotonin toxicity than in other conditions that share clinical features, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant hyperthermia.

Diagnosis is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical findings in a patient with a history of exposure to serotonergic agents and the exclusion of other conditions.

The frequency of serial ECGs depends on the severity of poisoning. If a patient presents with a minor ingestion and mild symptoms, a single additional ECG may suffice if normal. It is reasonable to repeat the ECG every two to four hours in patients with QTc intervals &gt;500 msec, until clinical improvement is seen. </p><p>Immediate nonsynchronized electric defibrillation is indicated in patients with hemodynamically unstable TdP.

Magnesium sulfate 2 g should be administered intravenously (IV) over two minutes in patients with life-threatening dysrhythmias. In patients with a QTc of &gt;550 msec who are otherwise hemodynamically stable, magnesium sulfate 2 g IV may be administered over 20 minutes, while close monitoring is performed. In addition, any hypokalemia or hypocalcemia should be corrected. The management of prolonged QTc is reviewed in detail separately.

A single dose of AC, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (typical adult dose is 50 g), may be given to a patient who presents within one to two hours of ingestion. AC should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients at risk for aspiration, such as those with vomiting or altered mental status. Tracheal intubation should <strong>not</strong> be performed for the sole purpose of administering AC. WBI refers to the administration of osmotically balanced polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution to induce liquid stool and mechanically flush pills or tablets from the gastrointestinal tract. The general use of AC and WBI in poisoning is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient#H18993761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;, section on 'Activated charcoal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient#H18993876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;, section on 'Whole bowel irrigation'</a>.)</p><p>As the most commonly prescribed formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> are extended-release (XR) preparations, gastrointestinal decontamination is likely to be effective even if presentation is delayed several hours after ingestion. A single dose of AC, followed by WBI, may be considered for a significant overdose of a sustained or XR preparation of a toxic drug, mainly bupropion or venlafaxine. However, with both venlafaxine and bupropion overdose, patients are at risk for seizures, and the risk of aspiration must be considered when deciding whether to pursue gastrointestinal decontamination. In addition, although WBI may enhance clearance, there are few data demonstrating that it improves morbidity or mortality. WBI may be given if a patient presents early after a potentially life-threatening ingestion, as long as the patient'-s mental status is normal at that time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3357212351\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular collapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular collapse in patients with atypical antidepressant poisoning is rare. In addition to standard resuscitative efforts, lipid emulsion, a novel therapy believed to work by pulling lipid-soluble drugs from tissues, has been used successfully to restore circulation in a patient who experienced seizure activity and cardiovascular collapse from an overdose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-poisoning-from-atypical-non-ssri-antidepressants-including-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snri/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Patients without significant clinical complications but whose electrocardiogram (ECG) manifests concerning abnormalities such as QT interval prolongation are admitted to a setting with cardiac monitoring.</p><p>Most patients with an atypical antidepressant ingestion may be medically cleared for a psychiatric evaluation if they are asymptomatic after six hours of observation and have no ECG changes attributable to the overdose.<strong> </strong>Closer observation is needed for patients whose ingestion involves any of the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained-release or extended-release (XR) formulations </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs associated with delayed-onset seizures, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs associated with cardiotoxicity, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a></p><p/><p>Delayed-onset cardiac and neurologic toxicities following overdose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> are well described. Such toxicity appears to be due to slow gut absorption from sustained release (SR) or extended release (XR) formulations. For this reason, it is advisable to admit patients with such ingestions for a longer observation period (24 hours is generally sufficient) with cardiac monitoring, especially if the formulation of the ingested drug is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2897992691\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children may be at increased risk of toxicity following ingestion of atypical antidepressants.

As an example, in a retrospective case series of unintentional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> ingestions in children &le;6 years, the most common clinical effects reported to the National Poison Data System included <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span> (4.3 percent), tachycardia (3.9 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">agitation/irritability</span> (3.1 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">drowsiness/lethargy</span> (2.4 percent), and seizures (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-poisoning-from-atypical-non-ssri-antidepressants-including-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snri/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The average time to the development of seizures was 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 3.2 hours, and the longest delay was 14 hours. </p><p>Given the paucity of literature about the newer atypical antidepressants, we suggest admitting even mildly symptomatic children for monitoring, especially with cases involving medications associated with an increased risk of toxicity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vilazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vilazodone</a>). If a patient is asymptomatic after 6 to 8 hours of observation, they may be medically cleared. However, any patient who ingested a sustained-release or extended-release (XR) product, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, should be admitted for at least 24 hours of observation of cardiac monitoring. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535542726\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222).
