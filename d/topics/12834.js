Despite this, the experience of serious illness, suffering, and impending death among individuals living chronically in shelters and on the streets is complex and poorly understood. Little has been written on this topic, making it difficult to formulate evidence based guidelines or describe best practices. This topic will discuss palliative care for homeless persons, reviewing the relevant literature in order to inform an evidence based but practical approach to these patients. Other issues related to the medical care of homeless persons are covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Health care of homeless persons in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6806096\"><span class=\"h1\">BARRIERS AND OBSTACLES TO PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few homeless persons receive primary care, let alone palliative care. The barriers to palliative care for homeless persons primarily relate to this population&rsquo;s special needs and limited access to the health care system. Examples of these barriers include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Health care of homeless persons in the United States&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of health insurance &ndash; Without medical insurance or disposable income, homeless persons cannot afford the costs of care and medications. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid psychiatric illness &ndash; Many homeless individuals suffer from comorbid psychiatric illness that makes them skeptical of institutions, fearful of crowds, and intolerant to bureaucracy. Estimates of the prevalence of severe mental illness range from 20 to 40 percent and substance use disorders from 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of transportation &ndash; Many homeless persons are not able to travel to and from medical clinics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> health centers, which limits their ability to access ambulatory care services.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The competing demands of finding food and shelter, which take priority over primary or specialty health care in most individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rules and expected codes of conduct in mainstream palliative care settings can be difficult for homeless persons who are used to the freedom of the streets and who might be struggling with a high burden of co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and substance use problems. They may also have experienced stigma in mainstream care settings because of their homelessness and co-occurring problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>Even once care is established, continuity is difficult to maintain. Many homeless persons lack a mailing address or telephone, greatly limiting the ability of health centers to monitor and support them in between visits. In this context, treatment regimens that require serial administrations, such as chemotherapy and radiation, can be very difficult to administer. Other major barriers to palliative care for this population include the inability to safely store or access palliative medications that are controlled (eg, opioids or sedatives) as well as the lack of support from a family caregiver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640814113\"><span class=\"h2\">Inpatient services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom an inpatient palliative care setting might be most appropriate, hospitalization can be challenging. For example, individuals who have lived chronically on the streets and shelters may struggle with the loss of freedom, privacy, and independence when admitted to an inpatient unit. Other issues that are present in many homeless patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance use &ndash; Comorbid substance use disorders can complicate the management of pain, anxiety, and other end of life symptoms. Patients with histories of exposure to illicit drugs and alcohol may have higher pain thresholds and may have developed tolerance to entire classes of agents commonly used in palliative care. Likewise, a history of substance use may increase risk for diversion or other aberrant drug-related behaviors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to follow codes of conduct &ndash; As noted above, persons used to the street and shelter culture may be accustomed to the freedom and independence of living without a stable routine, and they often have difficulty following the implicit rules of conduct in healthcare environments. This can be especially problematic in inpatient settings. Homeless persons are often found ineligible for admission or are asked to leave after violation of institutional rules, thus placing a considerable burden on shelters and community agencies to care for ill clients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6806102\"><span class=\"h1\">PREMATURE MORTALITY IN HOMELESS PERSONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies throughout the world, including Sweden, Australia, and the United States, consistently show that homeless persons often experience high illness burden and are at risk for early mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Therefore, a part of the comprehensive care of this population should include access to palliative care services to those for whom it would benefit. This is demonstrated in the following studies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One retrospective study of more than 28,000 adults in one major metropolitan city in the United States found a ninefold increase in deaths in the 25 to 44 year old group and a fourfold increase in those 45 to 64 years old when compared to housed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate prospective observational study involved a cohort of 119 &ldquo;rough sleepers,&rdquo; characterized as a subgroup of the homeless population that assiduously avoids shelters and dwells chronically on the streets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most had been homeless for more than a decade, and many for more than 20 years. The mean and median ages at the time of enrollment were 47 years, with a range from 32 to 82 years. Between 2000 and 2006, 44 (37 percent) died and another 6 (5 percent) were placed permanently in nursing homes. Cancer was the most common cause of death among these rough sleepers, followed by end-stage liver disease, obstructive lung disease, and heart failure. In our experience, most cancers in this population are lung, oropharyngeal, and hepatocellular, all of which are related to tobacco abuse, alcohol, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug use. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640814385\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCE CARE PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advance care planning is an important part of medical care for homeless persons, particularly those who are facing serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic life-threatening illnesses. Issues include advance directives (ADs), surrogate decision makers, and the communication of wishes about resuscitation (eg, Do Not Attempt Resuscitation [DNAR], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Do Not Intubate [DNI] orders) or whether to hospitalize or admit to an intensive care unit (ICU). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6806114\"><span class=\"h2\">Advance directives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of their lack of social connectedness, homeless patients are at risk of receiving care at the end of life that is inconsistent with their preferences, should they face a decision at a time they lack decisional capacity. For this reason, they should be encouraged to complete ADs. &#160; &#160; </p><p>The data show that many homeless persons are willing to discuss and document their ADs. As an example, in one prospective trial, 262 individuals were recruited from several homeless service sites in one city and randomly assigned to one of two strategies for completion of ADs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One group received the AD forms along with individual counseling with a social worker to assist with completion of the forms (intervention group, 38 percent completion rate), while the comparison group was given the AD forms with written information (control group, 13 percent completion rate). These data suggest that individualized counselling may be an effective strategy to engage these patients about end of life issues. Similar results were found in a study of 205 residents of a shelter in Canada; 103 (50 percent) chose to complete an AD when assisted by a counselor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Individuals who thought about death almost daily, held friends and family to be valuable, or knew their wishes for end of life care but had not shared them with anyone were more likely to complete an AD. </p><p>The effectiveness of advance care planning in this population (ie, the impact of having an AD on patient outcomes and care delivery) is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Homeless patients who author advance directives should be encouraged to keep a copy with them at all times. This is important to ensure that their wishes are followed, especially in settings that require urgent or emergent care. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1221637175\"><span class=\"h3\">Issues regarding resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an almost paradoxical reluctance to address resuscitation among homeless persons, despite their apparent willingness to complete advance directives. This was shown in two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One included 70 homeless persons, all of whom completed ADs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Almost all patients named a family member as their surrogate decision maker (rather than a friend). However, almost two-thirds wanted life-sustaining treatment, even if they were actively dying or in a coma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, in the Canadian study cited above of 103 shelter residents who completed an AD with the assistance of a counselor, almost two-thirds named a surrogate decision maker, and 94 percent refused to be DNR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6806114\" class=\"local\">'Advance directives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The reluctance of the individuals in these studies to agree to a DNR likely reflects the pervasive fear of abandonment among the homeless which may overly influence the decision to sign a DNR, despite their apparent desire to avoid hospitals and doctors whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640814330\"><span class=\"h2\">Homeless persons without decisional capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For homeless persons with a history of mental illness, mental health providers commonly encourage them to complete Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs) to declare their preferences and instructions for future treatment should they be determined to be suffering from a mental disorder that impairs their ability to make decisions or communicate with their healthcare providers. As a result, their AD might be available through the mental health record. If it is not available, every effort should be made to discuss their ADs proactively, preferably in advance of any medical issue that is reasonably anticipated. &#160;</p><p>Homeless persons who lack decisional capacity and have never completed an advance directive will need a surrogate decision maker. Unfortunately, homeless patients can be so isolated from their blood relatives that identifying a &ldquo;default&rdquo; surrogate decision maker (as is done routinely for incapacitated patients in the hospital) can be very difficult. In such cases, a judge will need to appoint a &ldquo;guardian ad litem&rdquo; to serve in this capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives#H616076112\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;, section on 'Surrogate decision makers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6806126\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE PALLIATIVE CARE FOR HOMELESS PERSONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640814599\"><span class=\"h2\">Understanding the meaning of loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common theme among homeless persons is the experience of early losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one focus group, this went beyond the death of loved ones (including family or friends), and encompassed personal losses (careers, income, health, and respect). Palliative care clinicians should be cognizant of these concerns and be prepared to address them in order to alleviate emotional suffering. </p><p>The experience of a death of a close acquaintance or friend is a near uniform experience among homeless persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A focus group that included 53 homeless persons found that virtually all participants had experienced the death of friends or loved ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These experiences appeared to inform their views on death as &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; and may have been a contribution to their disinterest in connecting with others. In one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homeless persons expressed fears related to dying alone, being unrecognized at the time they are discovered, or even remaining undiscovered after they have passed on [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many respondents reported their wish was to die with a friend nearby, and they expressed concerns related to mistrust of the health care system; specifically, that care would be withdrawn prematurely. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those who identified as having religious beliefs, most looked to an afterlife without pain or suffering. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many worried that they would be forgotten after internment or cremation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640814697\"><span class=\"h2\">Improving access to care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to inform improvements in the access to palliative care services for homeless persons, adopting a standard clinical approach to the provision of care is important, which includes serving as an agent and advocate for their medical and social needs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states#H12138087\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Health care of homeless persons in the United States&quot;, section on 'Clinical management'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>There are few data to inform the provision of palliative care among homeless persons. However, a reasonable approach builds on a qualitative study conducted with over 50 health and social services professionals involved with the end of life care of homeless persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Steps identified to improve palliative care services for homeless persons included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-threshold strategies to improve harm reduction, recognizing that many homeless persons at the end of life may not be ready for abstinence from nicotine, alcohol, and drugs. Examples of such strategies include supportive housing programs in which health care and social services are offered directly with a more stable living environment, medical respite facilities, and specialized programs in which palliative and end of life care can be delivered to persons who have no family or social supports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxed operating policies, including more pragmatic codes of conduct that understand the high burden of co-occurring medical, mental health, and substance use disorders of homeless persons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Utilization of patient navigators familiar with homeless services in the community who can connect persons to key services such as shelter-based clinics, community meals, and transportation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved training of professionals regarding the care of homeless persons.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6806132\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to pain management as part of end of life care for homeless populations can be quite challenging due to the high rates of substance use disorders. Many clinicians will not prescribe potentially addictive medications to patients with active substance abuse; still others fear jeopardizing sobriety among those patients who are in recovery. In addition, homeless persons are often reluctant to disclose the use of illicit drugs that may exclude them from care in a zero tolerance or abstinence system. </p><p>Therefore, any approach to pain management must build on physician trust, including acceptance of the patient&rsquo;s report of pain. As with patients who are not homeless, a comprehensive evaluation is required, including evaluation of the pain, an assessment for psychiatric symptoms, and substance use evaluations to inform an individualized approach to treatment, predicated on harm-reduction. For patients with a history of substance use, this may entail documented pain agreements, frequent clinic visits, and the use of long-acting opiates dispensed in small quantities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1208529672\"><span class=\"h2\">Harm reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, a major obstacle to palliative care for homeless persons has been the incompatibility of mainstream services with &ldquo;street culture.&rdquo; Restrictive or punitive policies toward the use of alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> illicit drugs in traditional palliative care settings can be a major obstacle to care for this disenfranchised population. (See <a href=\"#H6806096\" class=\"local\">'Barriers and obstacles to palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p>A qualitative study of structured interviews with 50 health and human services professionals delivering care to homeless persons in five Canadian cities underscores the need to bridge this divide, as abstinence from illicit drug use may be an unrealistic expectation for homeless persons facing death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A further study of 54 health and social services involved in palliative care for homeless persons in six Canadian cities found that harm reduction programs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> clinics, needle exchange programs, and safe injection sites often serve as an alternative health care system for homeless persons with substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Partnerships between harm reduction programs and mainstream palliative care services can improve access and the quality of services for homeless persons who need palliative care services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6806138\"><span class=\"h1\">HOMELESS PROGRAMS FOR PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who are not homeless wish to die at home, and most of the innovations in the delivery of palliative and end of life care enable them to do so as long as there is a stable residence and dependable support system to oversee and deliver basic and sometimes not-so basic palliative interventions. Unfortunately, this model of care does not lend itself well to caring for the homeless and displaced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care delivery in the home&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1574260866\"><span class=\"h2\">Housing first programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>However, at least in the United States, federal funds are increasingly available for permanent supportive housing programs for vulnerable individuals who have lived chronically in shelters and on the streets. These programs, often called &ldquo;housing first,&rdquo; do not require sobriety or adherence to psychiatric medications, but rather emphasize the delivery of targeted health and social services directly in these new homes. This has opened the possibility for the development of clinical teams that can provide palliative and hospice care to the formerly homeless who are dying and wish to die in a home. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1574260872\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical respite programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those still living in shelters and on the streets, or those formerly homeless individuals who are alone in housing with minimal or no social supports, medical respite care facilities have evolved as venues for the care of ill and dying individuals. Respite care for homeless persons is an attempt to fill the gap in the continuum of health care services for those who are ill or injured and no longer require costly acute care hospitalization but are too fragile to withstand the rigors of life in the shelters or on the streets. </p><p>Medical respite care for homeless persons can include acute and post-acute care, pre- and post-operative care for day surgery and other procedures, rehabilitative and recuperative care, and palliative and end of life care for those without homes or family supports. Respite programs now exist in over 50 United States cities, as well as in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, and Leeds and London in England. Boston&rsquo;s 104-bed respite program is a free-standing facility that offers 24-hour medical and nursing care, including palliative and end of life care, specifically for homeless and marginally housed persons without family or other supports as they face death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-for-homeless-persons/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1640814890\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The barriers to palliative care for homeless persons primarily relate to this population&rsquo;s special needs and limited access to the health care system.
