For this reason, they are called &quot;warm agglutinins&quot; even though they seldom directly agglutinate the RBCs. This condition differs from AIHA due to the presence of <strong>cold</strong> agglutinins, which are usually due to IgM antibodies that react with polysaccharide antigens on the RBC surface at temperatures below the core temperature of the body and can be associated with both RBC agglutination and hemolytic anemia.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the treatment of AIHA in the adult due to warm agglutinins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The patient should be told of the chronic nature of this disease at the time of diagnosis, since the subsequent course may be complex and protracted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Two semi-independent approaches to the treatment of warm agglutinin AIHA are employed, namely reduction in the production of the autoantibody and reduction in the effectiveness of the autoantibody in destroying red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduction in autoantibody production</strong> &ndash; Two means of reduction of antibody production are available in warm agglutinin AIHA: glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs, with most clinicians favoring initial treatment with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a>, an antibody that targets B cell lymphocytes, has also been shown to be very effective in reducing antibody production in a large number of autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, since the spleen represents approximately 25 percent of total lymphoid tissue in the body, its removal also helps to remove the source of the antibody. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Normal splenic function'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduction in autoantibody effectiveness</strong> &ndash; Antibody in AIHA destroys the red cells primarily by binding to Fc receptors on effector cells (phagocytes) of the immune system; this occurs most efficiently in the spleen due to close contact of the blood with these cells during the slow circulation through the cords of Billroth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53105 \">picture 1</a>). Binding results in phagocytosis (partial or complete) or membrane rupture. When complement is fixed, phagocytic cells in sites other than the spleen are able to bind to the target red cells efficiently. The hemolytic process can be reversed either by removing the primary site of destruction via splenectomy, or by reducing the interaction between splenic macrophages and the antibody-coated RBCs utilizing intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7617049\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4855516\"><span class=\"h3\">Stabilization of the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical syndrome of AIHA may become life-threatening when severe anemia is present. If the hemoglobin falls below a level able to sustain sufficient oxygenation, the patient may become lethargic, confused, and dyspneic with tachycardia. This presentation constitutes a medical emergency, especially in those with underlying cardiac disease. If not corrected, death from pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, or terminal cardiac arrhythmia is inevitable. Accordingly, corrective measures must be taken at once (eg, institution of glucocorticoids with or without high-dose intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>). Immediate transfusion of blood, which almost always requires urgent discussion with blood bank personnel, can be life-saving. Conversely, delay of transfusion because of blood matching issues can be fatal. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Red blood cell transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H848003\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids as first-line agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from the need for blood transfusion, most experts consider the use of single agent glucocorticoids to be the initial treatment of choice. However, this is based on experience rather than prospective, randomized trials. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below.) Since chronic hemolysis can lead to folate deficiency, the use of low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> has been suggested as long as hemolysis persists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies#H51743496\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;, section on 'Increased requirements'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H848018\"><span class=\"h3\">Search for secondary causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management should also include cessation of any possible offending drug (eg, penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>) and investigation for a contributing disorder (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome).

However, there are no prospective, randomized trials comparing second-line agents to guide the clinician in this matter. While the classically preferred second-line agent for such patients had been splenectomy, the use of rituximab as a second-line agent has been gaining favor in the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Given the absence of randomized trials, the choice of splenectomy versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is particularly difficult and may ultimately be decided by the patient, rather than the clinician, taking into account the age of the patient, performance status, suitability for surgery, and acuity of the illness, as well as the potential risks and benefits of each modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A similar issue (ie, splenectomy versus rituximab) arises in patients with immune thrombocytopenia who have failed first-line therapy with glucocorticoids. As is also true in patients with immune thrombocytopenia, the main factor for the selection of agent(s) employed in warm AIHA should be safety, as the curative potential of currently available modalities is low and such treatment may be more dangerous for the patient than the disease being treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warm-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
