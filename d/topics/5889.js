Acute injuries usually are related to falls, whereas chronic injuries occur with repetitive motion. Individuals who injure their elbows usually are throwers (eg, baseball and javelin), power grippers (eg, weight lifters, racquet athletes, gardeners, and carpenters), or those who use the elbow as a weightbearing joint (eg, gymnasts).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420628210\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elbow is made up of three interrelated joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874 \">figure 1</a>) and their stabilizing ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58982 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97474 \">figure 2</a>) are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radiocapitellar joint is formed laterally by the articulation of the capitellum of the humerus with the radial head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ulnohumeral joint is formed medially by the articulation of the humerus with the coronoid process, trochlear notch, and olecranon of the ulna.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radioulnar joint is formed by the articulation of the radial head with the radial notch of the ulna and is surrounded by the annular ligament.</p><p/><p>The medial and lateral epicondyle and olecranon process of the humerus are the bony landmarks that are easily palpated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56647\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56647 \">image 1</a>). The medial epicondyle is the origin of the wrist and finger flexors and pronators. The lateral epicondyle is the origin of the wrist and finger extensors. The olecranon process is the insertion of the elbow extensors (triceps). The olecranon bursa is the most superficial of the 12 bursae surrounding the elbow.</p><p>The muscles of the elbow and forearm can be divided according to their major actions: flexion or extension and supination or pronation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscles of elbow flexion or extension</strong> &ndash; Flexion or extension of the elbow occurs at the ulnohumeral joint. Elbow flexion is controlled by the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59976\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59976 \">figure 3</a>). The biceps brachii has insertions on the radial tuberosity and the forearm flexor fascia through the bicipital aponeurosis or lacertus fibrosis. The brachialis lies deep to the biceps and originates from the distal humerus and inserts on the coronoid process of the ulna.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Elbow extension is primarily controlled by the triceps and some of the anconeus. The normal arc of motion in children and adolescents ranges from -15 to 0 degrees in full extension to 150 degrees in flexion. At least 30 degrees from full extension and 130 degrees of flexion are necessary for the activities of daily living.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscles of supination or pronation</strong> &ndash; Supination or pronation of the forearm, with the radius rotating over the stationary ulna, occurs at the radiohumeral and proximal radioulnar articulations. The pronator quadratus and the pronator teres pronate the wrist. The pronator quadratus runs obliquely from the distal ulna to the more distal radius. The pronator teres originates from the medial epicondyle and the proximal ulna and inserts on the lateral midshaft of the radius.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The supinators are much stronger than the pronators and include the supinator and the biceps brachii. The supinator originates on the proximal posterior ulna and inserts on the proximal radius. The biceps brachii has insertions on the radial tuberosity and the forearm flexor fascia through the bicipital aponeurosis or lacertus fibrosis. The normal range of motion is approximately 90 degrees for both supination and pronation. At least 50 degrees of pronation and supination are necessary for the activities of daily living.</p><p/><p>Sensation and voluntary movement of the elbow and wrist are under control of the median, radial, ulnar, and musculocutaneous nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F53902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53902 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median nerve crosses the elbow in the antecubital fossa just medial to the biceps tendon and brachial artery and primarily innervates the wrist <span class=\"nowrap\">flexor/pronators,</span> finger flexors, and thenar muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ulnar nerve crosses the elbow posteriorly and medially in the cubital tunnel of the humerus and innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand and the flexor carpi ulnaris.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radial nerve crosses the elbow anterior to the lateral epicondyle and innervates the wrist extensors and supinators.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The musculocutaneous nerve crosses the elbow in the lateral antecubital fossa and innervates the elbow flexors.</p><p/><p>The brachial artery is the major artery that transverses the antecubital fossa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 4</a>); injury to the brachial artery will cause radiating pain, decreased skin temperature, decreased pulses, and pallor of the distal arm and may result in Volkmann's contracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT AND OSSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal maturity in children and adolescents is classified according to the appearance and fusion of the secondary ossification centers of the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. Childhood, in relation to bone age, ends with the appearance of all the secondary ossification centers; adolescence with the fusion of all secondary ossifications centers; and young adulthood with the completion of all bone growth.</p><p>The appearance of these ossification centers proceeds in an orderly fashion, usually occurring approximately one year earlier in girls than in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F61591\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61591 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73226 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elbow-injuries-in-active-children-or-skeletally-immature-adolescents-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Similar to the appearance of the ossification centers, fusion proceeds in an orderly fashion and usually occurs earlier in girls than in boys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F61591\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61591 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3836011\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The crucial elements of the history vary depending upon whether the complaints are acute or chronic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H400120311\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute complaints begin with a discrete event.

Chronic elbow injuries typically are caused by repetitive activity or start of a new activity. The frequency, intensity, duration, progression, and mechanics of the activity should be determined. This determination is particularly true for throwing because it causes medial traction and lateral compression of the elbow. In addition, the elbow is the weakest link in the kinetic chain, the connection of joints from the foot through the arm that is used to throw an object; biomechanical change especially in the shoulder and scapula caused by an injury can cause abnormal mechanics and stress that will result in secondary injury at the elbow.

Throwers with medial epicondyle apophysitis, for example, may complain initially of loss of control (eg, the tendency of the ball to sail higher than the intended target), followed by loss of endurance, pain, and finally loss of velocity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recent illnesses</strong> &ndash; Athletes being treated with quinolone antibiotics have been noted to have an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. The athlete should also be asked about recent illness because arthritis is a well-recognized and relatively common accompaniment to infection by a number of viruses.

The clinician should suspect a proximal radial fracture if there is tenderness over the radial head, and supination and pronation of the forearm produces pain on the lateral side of the elbow.
