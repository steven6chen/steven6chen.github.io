It is a disorder defined by clinical criteria that include symptoms and signs isolated to those produced by increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, papilledema, vision loss), elevated intracranial pressure with normal cerebrospinal fluid composition, and no other cause of intracranial hypertension evident on neuroimaging or other evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>While once called benign intracranial hypertension, to distinguish it from secondary intracranial hypertension produced by a neoplastic malignancy, it is not a benign disorder. Many patients suffer from intractable, disabling headaches, and there is a risk of severe, permanent vision loss.</p><p>Recommendations for the treatment of IIH are limited by a limited number of randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Moreover, the natural history of untreated IIH is uncertain</p><p>This topic will discuss the prognosis and treatment of IIH. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately.

A protracted course lasting months to years appears to be common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. In most patients, symptoms worsen slowly. With treatment, there is usually gradual improvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stabilization, but not necessarily recovery; many patients have persistent papilledema, elevated intracranial pressure as documented on lumbar puncture, and residual visual field deficits.</p><p>A subset of individuals with IIH have a more malignant or fulminant course with rapid development of vision loss within a few weeks of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. This is generally apparent at presentation. To limit the severity of permanent vision loss, more aggressive surgical treatment measures are considered at the outset, often with temporizing measures (eg. serial lumbar punctures, lumbar drain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corticosteroids) employed until surgery can be performed.</p><p>Permanent vision loss is the major morbidity associated with IIH. An early, hospital-based study that followed 57 patients for 5 to 41 years found that 24 percent developed blindness or severe visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Community and clinic-based studies have found a lower rate of severe visual loss of 6 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Studies have attempted to identify patients at risk of severe permanent vision loss. Significant vision loss at presentation suggests a higher risk as does higher grade papilledema and transient visual obscurations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,16</a>]. Other risk factors more variably identified in studies include male gender, systemic hypertension, anemia, black race, younger age or onset in puberty, more severe obesity or recent weight gain, and higher opening pressure on lumbar puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/4,6,12,15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,12,15,17-19</a>]. The presence or absence of findings on magnetic resonance imaging does not appear to predict visual outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Absence of papilledema appears to identify patients at low risk of vision loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Weight gain is a common but not universal antecedent to recurrent IIH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].

Follow-up visit intervals are individualized based on the severity, duration, and response to treatment of the clinical manifestations, but initially should be at least monthly. Each office visit should include a best corrected visual acuity, formal visual field testing, and dilated fundus examination with optic disc photographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Some patients with normal vision and minimal symptoms require no treatment other than monitoring.</p><p>Any potential agents that might cause or worsen IIH (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> derivatives) should be discontinued. However, this intervention alone may not be sufficient to manage IIH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, patients should be questioned regarding symptoms of sleep apnea; diagnostic polysomnography and treatment of sleep apnea should follow where appropriate. The association of sleep apnea and IIH is uncertain, but treatment of sleep apnea has other benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WEIGHT LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low-sodium weight reduction program is recommended for all obese patients with IIH and appears to alleviate symptoms and signs in many but not all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, studies documenting benefit are limited to observations in patients who generally receive treatment with other interventions for IIH.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort of 25 obese women with IIH, a low-calorie diet (425 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day)</span> for three months produced significant reductions in weight (mean 15.7 kg), intracranial pressure (mean decline 8.0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), and symptom prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Final outcomes of visual acuity and visual field deficits were similar between groups; however, visual fields and papilledema improved more quickly in the weight loss group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case series of 15 patients, a six percent weight loss over 24 weeks was associated with resolution of papilledema in obese IIH patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In this series, weight loss, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> treatment, appeared to be temporally associated with improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, in a study of nine obese women with IIH and polycystic ovary syndrome, a low calorie, low carbohydrate, high protein diet achieved a median weight loss of 3 percent and improved papilledema in all but one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>Medically supervised weight loss programs or surgically induced weight reduction (eg, gastric banding or gastric bypass procedures) may be necessary in morbidly obese patients. Case series of IIH patients undergoing gastric surgery report improvement of IIH symptoms and signs including papilledema, headache, tinnitus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. These findings were observed over one to three years after surgery and were associated with mean weight loss of 45 to 58 kg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These uncontrolled observations provide limited support for weight loss as a treatment for IIH. Because weight loss takes some time to achieve, other treatments for IIH are generally required at the same time. </p><p>Weight gain may be a risk factor for recurrence of IIH. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Weight loss also has other health benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical treatment for IIH typically starts with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Loop diuretics may be used as an adjunct. Corticosteroids are not recommended for most patients with IIH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are believed to reduce the rate of cerebrospinal fluid production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> is the usual first line treatment for IIH, there is no clear evidence that such treatment improves long-term prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a randomized trial of 165 patients with IIH and mild visual loss, treatment with acetazolamide was associated with modest improvements in a perimetric measurement of global visual field loss, along with improvements in papilledema grade, CSF pressure, and vision-related quality of life at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other observational evidence supports the use of acetazolamide. Lowered CSF pressure with acetazolamide has been documented in IIH patients who underwent continuous ICP recordings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Case series also suggest that in patients who can tolerate it, acetazolamide is successful in managing symptoms and stabilizing vision in 47 to 67 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. In addition, in a long-term follow-up study of 54 patients, the average treatment duration for acetazolamide was 14 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While recurrent episodes of IIH occurred in 38 percent over a mean 6.2 years of follow-up, no recurrences occurred in the setting of ongoing acetazolamide treatment.</p><p>In adult patients, we usually start with 500 mg twice per day and advance the dose as required and tolerated by the patient. Although doses of up to 2 to 4 g per day can be administered, many patients develop dose limiting side effects at higher levels. In young children, the recommended starting dose is 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day with a maximum dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 2 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The sustained release formulation (Diamox sequels) may be better tolerated by patients who are intolerant of generic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, but are substantially more expensive.</p><p>Although a sulfa allergy is reported to be a relative contraindication to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> use, there is little clinical or pharmacologic basis for this recommendation. A true cross-reaction between sulfonamide antimicrobials and the sulfa moiety in acetazolamide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> is unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Before prescribing acetazolamide to patients who report a sulfa allergy, we discuss the risks and benefits of treatment considering the nature of the adverse reaction comprising the reported sulfa allergy. For patients who have had major adverse reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis), we usually consider that the risk precludes the use of acetazolamide. Allergy consultation or other desensitization protocols may be considered in these patients, but we have not employed these. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfonamide allergy in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a>.) However, if the previous sulfa-related reaction was minor, we usually proceed with acetazolamide treatment. We treated 27 patients who had a reported sulfa allergy (excluding those that reported a severe adverse reaction) with acetazolamide; only two patients suffered urticaria, and there were no severe allergic cross-reactions to sulfa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another case series documents uneventful administration of acetazolamide to three patients with reported sulfa allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Other medication side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> include digital and oral paresthesias, anorexia, malaise, metallic taste, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, electrolyte changes, mild metabolic acidosis, and kidney stones. These are usually dose-related. Monitoring of electrolytes is suggested during acetazolamide treatment.</p><p>Pregnancy, particularly the first 20 weeks, is often considered a relative contraindication to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, which is classified by the FDA as category C for pregnancy risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F50021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50021 \">table 1</a>). Teratogenic effects have been reported with high doses in animals and a single case of a teratoma was seen in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/7,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,41</a>]. If we consider that the benefit of acetazolamide use outweighs potential risks, we do use it in pregnant women after discussion with the patient and the obstetrician and obtaining informed consent. Treatment options are somewhat limited in pregnancy as caloric restriction and the use of other diuretics are also relatively contraindicated during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Topiramate</a> is an antiseizure drug that inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity. Its efficacy in the treatment of migraine headaches and its association with weight loss are features that make it an attractive potential therapeutic option in IIH. Case reports and one small unblinded study suggest that topiramate appears to have a similar efficacy to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> with regard to visual field improvement and symptom relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. However, further study is needed before this can be considered a first-line treatment for IIH.</p><p>Other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methazolamide</a> (Neptazane), can also be used in acetazolamide-intolerant patients.

In one report of eight children treated with combined therapy of acetazolamide and furosemide, all had a rapid clinical response with resolution of papilledema, reduction in the mean CSF pressure after the first week of treatment, and normalization of CSF pressure within six weeks of starting therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The same considerations discussed above regarding sulfa allergy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> also apply to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>.

The choice of surgical procedure is individualized based upon available expertise and patient preference.
