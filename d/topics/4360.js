CAM therapies continue to gain popularity in the United States and throughout the world for the treatment of asthma and allergies.</p><p>This review is limited to those therapies about which there is published literature specifically concerning the treatment of allergic <span class=\"nowrap\">rhinitis/conjunctivitis</span>. These therapies include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupuncture, Ayurvedic medicine, a variety of herbal therapies, and several others.</p><p>CAM therapies for allergic <span class=\"nowrap\">rhinitis/conjunctivitis</span> are discussed in this topic review. CHM for allergic diseases and CAM therapies for asthma are reviewed elsewhere.

Complementary therapies are used together with conventional allopathic medicine, while alternative therapies are used in place of conventional medicine. More general reviews of the principles of various CAM therapies are also found separately.

The popularity of CAM therapies for allergic disease is even greater in some European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, it is important to ask patients about the use of CAM therapies in a nonjudgmental manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The use of CAM is growing in Western countries because of the reputed effectiveness, low cost, and favorable safety profiles of some therapies. Patients are often interested in alternative therapy either because conventional therapies are unsatisfactory or because of concerns about side effects of synthetic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The chronic nature of allergic diseases and the paucity of preventive or curative treatments also stimulate interest in CAM therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There are marked cultural differences in use of CAM (eg, patients from Southeast Asia commonly use herbal remedies for allergic rhinitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21282295\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers to integration with allopathic medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the major concerns with CAM is that it is perceived to be &quot;natural&quot; and therefore safe by patients, but an analysis of safety reporting in randomized trials of CAM found that reporting of adverse effects was largely inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Improvement in safety reporting would facilitate integration into routine patient care. However, until this materializes, healthcare providers can familiarize themselves as much as possible with the available scientific literature on CAM. Evidence-based information of CAM therapies is available through several internet sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements&quot;, section on 'Internet evidence-based resources'</a>.)</p><p>Given the high prevalence of allergic diseases and associated costs of the CAM treatments, high quality data about these therapies are needed so that practice guidelines can be established. In the United States, the <a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/&amp;token=xet4a8U02gaKYNXGdDyCVxMoXW/Ak4AwV+Aw+biWoFY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16359\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCIH/National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</a> has been tasked with evaluating mechanisms, efficacy, and safety of botanical medicines through basic science studies, clinical research, and the establishment of dedicated botanical research centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The design of randomized placebo-controlled studies in CAM is complicated by difficulties in blinding, creating an appropriate placebo (particularly for acupuncture), and designing a control treatment when the mechanisms of actions of the modality in question are poorly delineated (such as homeopathy). Additionally, the difference in philosophy of CAM interventions from conventional health care allows for significant variation in the way CAM modalities are practiced (ie, therapies are often individualized for a particular patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> specific disease state). Finally, the efficacy of CAM therapies may be heavily influenced by the patient's perception of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> interaction with the provider, which is often more personal than the interaction between patients and allopathic healthcare providers. Thus, results may vary significantly among CAM providers and studies of CAM must also account for the influence of the patient-provider relationship.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21282386\"><span class=\"h1\">TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) includes herbal therapy, acupuncture, massage, and dietary therapy. These practices originated in China and have been used in East Asia for centuries as a part of mainstream medical care. TCM treatments for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chinese-herbal-medicine-for-the-treatment-of-allergic-diseases#H15105480\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of allergic diseases&quot;, section on 'Therapy for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15106287\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUPUNCTURE AND ACUPRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acupuncture is a component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that was originally thought to work on the principle of redistribution of Qi, the life energy. In TCM, disease is believed to originate from an imbalance of Qi or poor flow of Qi. The difficulties in designing trials of acupuncture are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;, section on 'Basic theory'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;, section on 'Difficulties in research'</a>.)</p><p>Studies of acupuncture for the treatment of allergic rhinitis have shown mixed results, with the most rigorous studies showing very modest clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. A 2015 practice guideline suggested the potential use of acupuncture, but included limited data supporting its use in allergic rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review identified 116 potentially relevant articles, of which 12 met criteria for inclusion by studying needle acupuncture, examining clinically relevant outcomes, and including a control, sham, or comparator treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The results were different for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. There were no effects on seasonal symptoms, although some benefit was apparent for perennial symptoms. The magnitude of effect could not be estimated, although drug therapy could not be reduced as a result of acupuncture in either type of rhinitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent randomized controlled trial demonstrated statistically significant but clinically modest improvement in the primary endpoint of total nasal symptom score after the fourth week of treatment. Improvement was not sustained one week after completion of the four-week course, but was surprisingly present three weeks later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter randomized trial of 422 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis to birch and grass pollen (ACUSAR &ndash; ACUpuncture in Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis), subjects were treated with eight weeks of acupuncture with rescue antihistamine (RA), sham acupuncture with RA, or RA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Rhinitis-related quality of life and antihistamine use were measured after the eight weeks of treatment, an additional eight weeks later, and one year later. When compared with sham acupuncture with RA and RA alone, acupuncture with RA resulted in an improvement of 0.5 points and a reduction in medication use of 0.7 points, where 1 point was equivalent to taking one less 10 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> tablet daily. Thus, the benefit was statistically significant, but of questionable clinical importance. In a cost-effectiveness analysis of these data, the authors concluded that while acupuncture did cause small improvements in quality of life, it was very expensive and may not be a cost-effective intervention for allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Critique of the protocol used in ACUSAR included the use of more needles in the acupuncture patients versus the sham patients (16 compared with 10) and a larger fraction of patients in the acupuncture arm having high expectations for acupuncture efficacy at baseline (85 versus 73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the study was performed in two centers in South Korea and China, and pollen counts during the years of treatment and observation, which can dramatically influence results, were not reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture#H1231910994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;, section on 'Trials for conditions other than pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In summary, the best trials of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis support limited benefit. Despite this, acupuncture may be a reasonable option for interested patients with relatively mild disease who wish to minimize medication use and find the cost of therapy acceptable.</p><p>Acupressure is similar to acupuncture but does not involve needles. Stainless steel pellets in adhesive discs are applied to specified points (acupoints) on the ear, and the pellets are pressed firmly into the skin. In a randomized sham-controlled trial, ear acupressure was studied for the treatment of mild to moderate perennial allergic rhinitis of 245 adults for eight weeks with a follow-up period of 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Subjects were treated for 5 to 10 minutes weekly by a practitioner in a clinic and instructed to perform the therapy three times daily at home, for 10 seconds per session. There was a small but statistically significant improvement in sneezing and quality of life in the acupressure group after eight weeks, with additional improvements in most measures of nasal symptoms at the end of the follow-up period compared with the sham group. These findings are interesting, although additional studies will be required to make more definitive recommendations about the utility of this therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14493471\"><span class=\"h1\">AYURVEDA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ayurvedic medicine is a medical tradition originating from India and derived from the teachings of ancient Hindu healers, which first appeared in text between 1500 and 1000 BC. Like TCM, Ayurvedic therapeutic interventions include yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, and herbal preparations. In its truest form, Ayurveda exists for the &quot;promotion of health&quot; rather than the treatment of specific disease states that have already begun to affect the body.</p><p>Ayurvedic herbal therapies have been evaluated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Aller-7 is a mixture of seven Indian herbs (Albizia lebbeck, Terminalia chebula, Terminalia bellerica, Phyllanthus emblica, Piper nigrum, Piper longum, and Zingiber officinale) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In vitro studies examining the mixture demonstrated antihistaminic and antiinflammatory properties. In an experimental model using the nonspecific mast cell degranulating agent <span class=\"nowrap\">48/80</span> (&quot;antihistamine model&quot;), Aller-7 appeared to be equivalent to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>. In the best human study to date, Aller-7 was compared with placebo in 545 adult patients with allergic rhinitis (171 of whom took part in randomized protocols, while the others were treated in an open label fashion, treated for 12 weeks with 660 mg Aller-7 twice daily by mouth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Clinically significant effects were noted at 6 and 12 weeks, which included 10 to 20 percent improvement in congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing compared with the placebo group in those patients in randomized protocols. Adverse effects were almost twice that of placebo and were largely mild gastrointestinal issues (eg, gastritis, discomfort, and dryness of mouth). Aller-7 is commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26306590\"><span class=\"h1\">HERBAL THERAPIES (SYSTEMIC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of herbal preparations may be used by patients with allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, although scientific evaluation of herbal products has been limited and only those that have been evaluated in published clinical trials are reviewed here. A 2007 systematic review identified 16 randomized controlled trials that met eligibility criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The agents discussed in this section are listed by their English names and their Latin or pharmacopeial names.</p><p>Most herbal preparations contain several components, each with potentially varying physiologic and pharmacologic properties. However, herbal therapies that differ by name may contain identical components and thus share similar clinical effects and adverse effects. This is important when trying to analyze studies that attribute a clinical or physiologic property to a specific herbal preparation.</p><p>In many countries, herbal medicines are minimally regulated and uncommonly monitored for adverse events by national surveillance systems. However, the increasing popularity of herbal medicines has led to concerns over their safety, quality, and efficacy on the part of health authorities and the general public. In response to these concerns, the World Health Organization has published formal monographs on selected medicinal plants to establish quality standards of herbal products and outline the parameters for their safe and effective use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Lack of regulatory reform in the herbal industry makes it difficult for the clinician to provide an informed response. One option is to recommend brands that have been tested by independent sources, such as Consumer Labs, and found to meet minimum quality criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For ethical reasons, supplements sold through practitioners' offices or multilevel marketing plans should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7646793\"><span class=\"h2\">Children and pregnant or lactating women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very few studies of herbal therapies have been conducted on infants and children or in pregnant and lactating women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Issues of particular concern include proper dosing in young children and greater susceptibility of fetuses and children to potential contaminants.

A systematic review of small, but randomized trials comparing herbal therapies with either placebo or active drug found evidence of efficacy based upon six double-blind randomized-controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In three of these, butterbur compared favorably with standard doses of nonsedating antihistamines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, 10 mg daily and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>, 180 mg daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Butterbur preparations are available under a variety of brand names.</p><p>Multiple portions of the butterbur plant can contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, compounds that have hepatotoxic and potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. At least 40 reports have appeared worldwide concerning hepatotoxicity with use of butterbur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Most cases of pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicity result in moderate to severe liver damage. Early signs and symptoms include nausea and acute upper abdominal pain, while more advanced toxicity may present with abdominal distension, jaundice, and the development of ascites. In some cases, if the ingestion of the source is not stopped, the toxicity can lead to hepatic fibrosis and potentially fatal cirrhosis. Manufacturing processes can reduce the content of alkaloids and consumers should choose products that are labeled as low in pyrrolizidine alkaloids. However, they should also be aware of this potential hazard and be advised about early symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4358409\"><span class=\"h3\">Tinofend (Tinospora cordifolia)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinofend is an Indian herbal medication containing extract from the stem of <em>Tinospora cordifolia</em>. In a double-blind randomized trial of 75 patients with allergic rhinitis, those receiving <em>T. cordifolia</em> (at a dose of 300 mg three times daily for eight weeks) reported statistically significant improvement in sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and nasal pruritus, compared with those receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The drug was well tolerated, although it caused an increase in total blood leukocyte count in 70 percent of patients in the active treatment group, compared with 11 percent of those receiving placebo; a statistically significant difference. This was attributed to a possible &quot;immunostimulatory&quot; effect by the authors. There have been limited reports of hepatic toxicity, although several in vitro analyses performed by a manufacturer were reassuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12555896\"><span class=\"h3\">Cinnamon bark, Spanish needle, and acerola</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combination of cinnamon bark extract, dehydrated Spanish Needle (<em>Bidens pilosa</em>) leaf and stem, and acerola fruit concentrate (at a dose of 450 mg three times daily) was compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> (10 mg once daily) and placebo in a randomized double-blind crossover study of 20 subjects with allergic rhinitis and sensitization to timothy grass pollen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-allergic-rhinitis-and-conjunctivitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Only loratadine significantly reduced symptoms acutely during the challenge, although both the botanical product and loratadine significantly reduced nasal symptoms two to eight hours after the challenge, compared with placebo. The magnitude of effect with both treatments was clinically significant. The botanical product appears to inhibit the production of prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> following challenge, which may suggest a steroid-like impact that affects the late-phase response of allergic inflammation.
