An individual experiencing depersonalization may report feeling like an automaton, as if in a dream, or as if watching himself or herself in a movie. Depersonalized individuals may report the sense of being an outside observer of their mental processes or their body. They often report feeling a loss of control over their thoughts, perceptions, and actions.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-treating-depersonalization-derealization-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to treating depersonalization/derealization disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3222623445\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several psychotherapies, in our clinical experience, can help patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder (DDD), including psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, hypnotherapeutic, and supportive therapies. No controlled clinical trials have been performed to assess or compare the efficacy of these interventions.</p><p>Clinicians working with patients with depersonalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> derealization may have an excessively pessimistic view of the treatment responsiveness of DDD because they often have an opportunity to intervene only years after onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], at which point the symptoms tend to have become more constant and possibly more treatment resistant. Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients are more likely to respond if treatment is begun earlier in the course of the disorder or if the disorder has an episodic or fluctuating course. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3059893064\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been developed to treat DDD, but has not been tested in controlled clinical trials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444740967\"><span class=\"h3\">Conceptual model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cognitive-behavioral model for DDD proposes that a fear of affect is a central component of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Dissociation of affect (&ldquo;not feeling&rdquo;) and alexithymia (difficulty identifying and verbalizing internal emotional states) are seen as core components of the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with DDD frequently recount traumatic or stressful life experiences in a way that is highly robotic, matter-of-fact, and without feelings. A distinct subgroup of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder also suffers from depersonalization and derealization symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dissociative aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Acute DDD represents an almost ubiquitous response to extreme stress. A cognitive framework has been used to describe mechanisms that contribute to the exacerbation and maintenance of the initial symptoms after the stressor lifts, rather than their attenuation and extinction.</p><p>This cognitive-behavioral model proposes that an initial trigger (trauma, anxiety, depression, stress, fatigue, or intoxication) can induce transient symptoms of depersonalization and derealization which are subsequently cognitively processed by an individual as either situational or catastrophic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If the attributions are situational, and therefore more benign, the depersonalization symptoms will tend to fade as the situational factors lessen. However, if the attributions are catastrophic, they evoke overwhelming fears such as going mad, losing control, becoming invisible, or having a permanent brain dysfunction. In turn, such fears can lead to an increase in anxiety coupled with a paradoxical decrease in arousal, resulting in increased intensity of the <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> symptoms as the individual enters the maintenance phase. During this phase, individuals may start to avoid situations that they associate with symptom provocation, become preoccupied with safety behaviors (such as avoidance or &ldquo;acting normal&rdquo;), and develop cognitive biases so that they over-monitor their symptoms and have a reduced threshold for the perception of threat. These maintenance factors thus serve to perpetuate or exacerbate the symptoms over time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4121465025\"><span class=\"h3\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In CBT for DDD, the focus is on developing techniques to: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitively reinterpret symptoms as less threatening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce symptom monitoring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminish avoidance and safety behaviors</p><p/><p>As an example, consider a patient with DDD who is constantly preoccupied with existential ruminations; has checking rituals to determine whether the symptoms are still present; believes that they have suffered irreversible brain damage; and avoids many activities, such as leaving home, socializing, or being in overstimulating environments out of the fear that these will worsen the symptoms. </p><p>Using thought-blocking and distraction techniques, the patient can be helped to ruminate less and resist checking rituals using a distracting task. Cognitive corrections can be used to counter catastrophic cognitions, such as the one involving irreversible brain damage. A hierarchical exposure approach can be used to help the patient gradually confront, rather than avoid, situations that worsen the symptoms. If anxiety is exacerbating the symptoms, cognitive and <span class=\"nowrap\">relaxation/breathing</span> retraining and grounding techniques, involving reorienting the patient to the present time and place, can be used to keep anxiety in better check while explaining to the patient the vicious cycle of anxiety triggering more depersonalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> derealization, and depersonalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> derealization then triggering worsened anxiety. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000386579\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited evidence suggests CBT may be effective for DDD. An uncontrolled, prospective trial tested CBT in 21 patients with chronic DDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Compared with the start of treatment, reductions were seen in depersonalization, derealization, dissociation, and other psychiatric symptoms at the end of the 12-week intervention and at a follow-up assessment six months later. At the end of 12 weeks, 29 percent of participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for DDD. Seventeen of the 21 patients received medication concurrently, but only three had medication changes during the intervention period. Further research on the effectiveness of CBT for DDD is needed, including larger, randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1519274125\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT is initially undertaken as a 12 to 16 session course with weekly sessions. Progress is assessed at the end of the first round of treatment, and a decision is made about whether patients should continue in once weekly CBT or can taper down to monthly booster sessions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H818816\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychodynamic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychodynamic psychotherapy for DDD focuses on underlying threats to self-constancy that give rise to affectively intolerable states. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H819758\"><span class=\"h3\">Conceptual model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to psychoanalytic theories, a person in whom the cohesiveness or stability of self-representations is profoundly threatened may resort to depersonalization, ie, a disconnection from the self, as a response to the overwhelming shifts in self-experience. Although such a response may be in some ways ubiquitous, hard-wired, and even adaptive in the short run, its persistence over time becomes maladaptive and pathological. </p><p>A psychodynamic understanding of <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> phenomena centers around the inability to integrate various aspects of one's self-experience due to external stressors or internal processes that pose an overwhelming challenge to an individual's &quot;usual expected&quot; sense of self [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The self can be conceptualized as having lost its cohesion, so that the &quot;physical&quot; self, &quot;thinking&quot; self, &quot;feeling&quot; self, or &quot;acting&quot; self are poorly integrated with each other leading in discontinuities of various sorts in the experience of the self. </p><p>Psychodynamic theories similarly suggest that depersonalization and derealization can be linked to various levels of character pathology: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In psychotic-spectrum character pathology, the symptoms may be triggered by experiences of impaired self and other differentiation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In borderline psychopathology, unstable and switching self-representations may be associated with depersonalization or derealization experiences. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In narcissistic pathology, when self-constancy is threatened by the loss, real or imagined, of self-objects serving purposes of object constancy, depersonalization or derealization may arise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In psychopathology related to mood (anxiety, depression) or cognition (obsessions or compulsions), derepressed self-representations associated with overwhelming intrapsychic conflict and associated affect may trigger depersonalization or derealization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H819817\"><span class=\"h3\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In psychodynamic psychotherapy, the therapist has the opportunity to observe and analyze, often in a microprocess, moment-to-moment fashion, such dynamics as they occur inside the session or as they are described by the patient. This microanalysis of symptoms as they wax and wane during psychotherapy sessions can be most effectively utilized with an affect-phobia psychodynamic model in mind. This model implies that the hypoemotionality, emotional numbness, and alexithymia (inability to name or describe feelings) stems from a need to &ldquo;dissociate&rdquo; unbearable affects and their accompanied cognitions, relational structures, and historical origins. &#160;</p><p>The goal of an affect-based therapy, such as psychodynamic psychotherapy, is to uncover, experience, label, own, and verbalize intolerable emotions, and to process such emotions in the context of underlying conflicts and disavowed self-representations and self-states (ie, poorly integrated components of identity). Eventually, such emotions can be gradually integrated with the core sense of self, so that the individual can transition from an &ldquo;unreal&rdquo; self to a more &ldquo;real&rdquo; owned self. </p><p>The affects needing to be dealt with can vary greatly depending on each person&rsquo;s history and sense of self, ranging from the negative to the positive, and can include anger, grief, sorrow, shame, guilt, excitement, and love. In a simple sense, this approach counters the defensive aspect of the depersonalization by mobilizing affect rather than detaching from it. This is consistent with exposure-based and cognitive restructuring treatments for trauma-related conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder or dissociative identity disorder, as the goal in therapy of DDD is to activate and experience rather than to better temper and regulate intense affects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Conversely, when a patient reports moments of lessened depersonalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> derealization, in or out of session, the circumstances that facilitated the containment and awareness of difficult affects are explored. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H819824\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No clinical trials have been conducted on psychodynamic psychotherapy for DDD.

Patients are shown how to practice cognitive control over the symptoms through self-hypnosis. They learn how to modulate symptoms by making a controlled connection to emotional memories, past self-states, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interactions causing different degrees of dissociative symptoms, including pleasant or less threatening forms of depersonalization or derealization. Data are limited on hypnotizability in individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder.
