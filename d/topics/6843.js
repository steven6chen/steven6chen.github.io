This prevalence is similar to low back pain, but few patients with neck pain lose time from work and less than 1 percent develop neurologic deficits.</p><p>Clinical disorders affecting the cervical spine can be categorized as those that predominantly cause neck pain and those that most often cause extremity pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic dysfunction. Disorders that cause neck pain include cervical strain, internal disc disruption <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/discogenic</span> pain, cervical facet-mediated pain, cervical &quot;whiplash&quot; syndrome, and myofascial pain. Disorders that predominantly cause extremity symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic dysfunction include cervical radiculopathy and cervical spondylotic myelopathy.</p><p>The evaluation of the patient with cervical spine disease is reviewed here. The management of disorders of the neck is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-neck-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of neck pain&quot;</a>). Evaluation of a patient with acute neck trauma is also discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spinal column injuries in adults&quot;</a>).

The articulation between the occiput and the first cervical vertebra (the atlantooccipital joint) allows for approximately one-third of flexion and extension and one-half of lateral bending of the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The articulation between the first and second cervical vertebrae (the atlantoaxial joint) allows for 50 percent of rotational range of motion. The articulations between the second and seventh cervical vertebrae allow for approximately two-thirds of flexion and extension, 50 percent of rotation, and 50 percent of lateral bending.</p><p>The most severe injuries and greatest wear and tear occur between C4 and C7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; the nerve roots passing through the intervertebral foraminal in these areas are C5, C6, and C7. Uncovertebral articulations (also known as joints of Luschka) are present in the C3-7 spinal segments, located on the posterolateral border of the intervertebral disc, and in the anteromedial portion of the intervertebral foramen. These articulations are not true synovial joints, but can hypertrophy, associated with disc degeneration, and result in narrowing of the intervertebral foramen. This foraminal narrowing is a common cause of cervical radiculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The cervical and trapezius muscles have two major functions: to support and provide movement and alignment for the head and neck and to protect the spinal cord and spinal nerves when the spinal column is under mechanical stress. The normal cervical spine has a shallow lordosis, maintained by the neck muscles.</p><p>This lordosis can be decreased in patients with degenerative changes. Severe degenerative changes in the cervical spine can result in reversal of the lordosis. The lordosis may also become accentuated in compensation for patients with prominent thoracic kyphosis. Alterations in spinal alignment, however, have not definitively been demonstrated to cause cervical pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroanatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are eight cervical spinal nerves. Each spinal nerve arises from the spinal cord by two roots, the ventral and dorsal spinal roots. The ventral root contains motor efferent fibers from alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The dorsal root carries primary sensory afferent fibers from cells in the dorsal root ganglion. The dorsal and ventral spinal roots combine to form the spinal nerve.</p><p>This spinal nerve then divides into two branches, a dorsal primary ramus and a ventral primary ramus. The dorsal ramus divides and supplies innervation to muscular, cutaneous, and articular branches for posterior neck structures. The ventral rami supply the prevertebral and paravertebral muscles and form the brachial plexus, which subsequently innervates the upper limb. The sensory cervical dermatomes are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A myotome is the group of muscles innervated by a spinal nerve. The diaphragm is innervated by C3 to C5 spinal nerves and respiratory paralysis may result from spinal cord injuries above C5.</p><p>Cervical radiculopathy may be caused by degenerative changes in the spine that impact the ventral root and cause focal weakness. Specific findings with different levels of nerve root involvement are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Cervical level correlates to findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2007 task force on neck pain, representing multiple specialties and institutions, recommends a classification system for neck pain severe enough to cause patients to seek care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I: No signs of major pathology and little interference with daily activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II: No signs of major pathology but may impact daily activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III: Neck pain with neurologic signs or symptoms (radiculopathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV: Neck pain with major pathology (eg, fracture, myelopathy, neoplasm, spinal infection)</p><p/><p>These classifications can be helpful in determining urgency of care and appropriateness of intervention.

Systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or bone metastases should be considered in appropriate patients. Degenerative changes are the most common etiology for axial neck pain. An approach to diagnosis is described below, for patients in whom there is no evidence of rheumatologic, oncologic, and infectious etiologies on history and examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical strain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical strain is a nonspecific diagnosis, classically used to describe an injury to the cervical paraspinal muscles and ligaments with associated spasm of the cervical and upper back muscles. The diagnosis of cervical strain is reasonable in patients with acute axial neck and trapezius pain, where neurologic dysfunction has been excluded.</p><p>Cervical strain may result from the physical stresses of everyday life, including poor posture and sleeping habits. Typically, symptoms are experienced as pain, stiffness, and tightness in the upper back or shoulder, and last for up to six weeks. Patients with chronic symptoms that extend beyond the expected time frame for resolution should not receive this nonspecific diagnosis; muscle pain alone should not be routinely considered a chronic nociceptor.</p><p>Potential mechanisms for chronic pain include cervical discogenic pain, facet mediated pain, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, cervical radicular pain, myofascial pain, and centrally- or peripherally-mediated neuropathic pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical spondylosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term cervical spondylosis is variably used to include soft tissue, disc, and degenerative bony lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Degenerative changes in the cervical spine are apparent on radiographs of many adults over the age of 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The abnormalities include a sequential change in the intervertebral discs, with osteophyte formation along the vertebral bodies, and changes in the facet joints and laminal arches. There is a continuum from normal aging to the overtly pathologic state. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Correlation between the degree of radiographic change and the presence or severity of pain is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Given the prevalence of radiographic abnormalities in asymptomatic subjects, clear distinction of the clinical entity of cervical spondylosis is difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical discogenic pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical degenerative disc disease is more aptly a radiologic diagnosis, rather than a clinical syndrome, as it is commonly seen on radiograph studies in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In one twelve-year prospective longitudinal study, changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicating progressive disc degeneration were seen in 81 percent of 223 subjects who were asymptomatic (mean age 39 years) at study onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For this reason, other terms have been introduced to describe patients who are symptomatic with disc-related neck pain: cervical internal disc disruption syndrome or cervical discogenic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Cervical discogenic pain may be the most common cause of neck pain.</p><p>In contrast to patients with cervical disc herniations, cervical discogenic pain refers to derangement in the architecture of the disc that results in mechanical neck pain with or without features of inflammation. The degenerative process that occurs in the intervertebral disc is associated with an inability to effectively distribute pressures between the disc, vertebral endplates, and facet joints.</p><p>Axial pain is more severe than extremity pain in cervical discogenic pain. Extremity pain can occur, but is felt to result from somatic referral rather than spinal nerve root impingement. Symptoms are often exacerbated when the neck is held in one position for prolonged periods, such as occurs with driving, reading, or working at a computer. There is often associated muscle tightness and spasms.</p><p>Examination should demonstrate axial neck discomfort with range of motion, a decreased range of motion, and a benign neurologic examination. MRI imaging demonstrating the degree of degeneration does not accurately implicate which discs are symptomatically painful; asymptomatic degenerative changes are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical facet syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The zygapophyseal joint, commonly referred to as the facet joint, can cause axial pain and is probably the most common cause of whiplash-related neck pain and headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Historically, patients often have a history of trauma with an abrupt flexion-extension type injury, or an occupation which leads to repeatedly positioning the neck in extension.</p><p>Pain is often midline or offset slightly to one side. Symptoms can be somatically referred to the shoulders, periscapular region, occiput, or proximal limb. As with cervical discogenic pain, axial symptoms are greater than extremity symptoms.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no specific historical examination, or imaging finding, that provides confirmatory diagnostic information. A fluoroscopically guided intraarticular injection of a small aliquot of local anesthetic, or anesthetization of the innervation of the joint resulting in relief are considered the definitive diagnostic tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Whiplash injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cervical &quot;whiplash&quot; syndrome is caused by a traumatic event with an abrupt <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span> movement to the cervical spine. Symptoms of whiplash include severe pain, spasm, loss of range of motion in the neck, and occipital headache. Pain can be persistent with little identifiable abnormality seen on MRI, computed tomography (CT), radiograph, or bone scan imaging. Often multiple structures can be injured including soft tissues, spinal nerve, intervertebral disc, posterior longitudinal ligament, interspinous ligaments, alar ligaments, facet joints, or other osseous structures.</p><p>The injury is common but remains poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a case controlled study of 1843 drivers involved in a motor vehicle accident, 26 percent of whom had neck pain for more than one day, eight variables were identified as risk factors for whiplash injury: female, younger age, prior history of neck pain, rear collision, stationary vehicle, severity of collision, not being at fault, and monotonous work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a systematic review of 47 studies, approximately 50 percent of adults with whiplash injury reported neck pain symptoms at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The pathology of the condition is unclear. Microvascular bleeding and local release of inflammatory mediators may explain the acute symptoms, but some patients remain symptomatic for many months or even years. Soft tissue injury may be associated with the degree of impairment. A study using high resolution MRI imaging of the C spine in patients with a remote history of whiplash injury (mean 6 years), and symptoms that had persisted at least 3 months following injury, demonstrated soft tissue damage, particularly of the alar ligaments, not seen in MRI images in control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In a study in the United Kingdom, the most important predictors of pain at one year were pain severity at the time of the rear-end collision and the presence of a compensation claim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition to pain symptoms, neck mobility is another important risk factor that predicts disability one year after whiplash injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Chronic whiplash symptoms may also be associated with different cultural expectations; 50 percent of Canadian and British subjects surveyed anticipated chronic neck pain following a hypothetical whiplash injury compared to negligible numbers from respondents in Lithuania and Germany, where late neck pain prevalence is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A legislative change in Australia, removing financial compensation for pain and suffering from whiplash injuries, was associated with improvement in functional status and pain indices in patients with whiplash, compared to historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical myofascial pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional pain with associated trigger points, taut bands, and pressure sensitivity has been called myofascial pain. Myofascial pain can be a nonspecific manifestation of any pathologic condition that causes pain from the neck to the shoulder. Myofascial pain can also be associated with muscle sensitivity, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and likely represents a less generalized variant of fibromyalgia. It is thought that chronic mechanical muscle overuse or direct trauma may play a role in the development of myofascial pain and trigger points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The neurologic exam should involve the following components: muscle strength, reflex testing, muscle tone, gait, and testing for upper motor neuron signs. A detailed neurologic examination is described separately. In patients with axial neck pain alone, the following components should be included: cervical range of motion, examination for lymphadenopathy or other red flags, testing for upper motor neuron signs, and an abbreviated muscle strength, sensory, and reflex testing examination.

These correlations, however, are tempered by variability in the quality of the neurologic examination performed.</p><p>The majority of patients with pure sensory radiculopathy have a good prognosis and respond to a combination of rest, exercise, postural modifications, and occasionally medication or corticosteroid injection. In contrast, patients with sensorimotor involvement (with or without spinal cord compression) are more likely to have more dramatic degrees of disk herniation, are at higher risk for nerve damage, and are more likely to require surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle strength</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strength should be evaluated by testing the following actions against resistance: shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, and lower limb extension and flexion.

C6 radiculopathy can easily be confused for C5 or C7 radiculopathy. Weakness can overlap with the C5 or C7 muscles. Muscles affected include: infraspinatus, bicep, brachioradialis, pronator teres, and triceps. Weakness involves flexion at the elbow, or shoulder external rotation. The bicep or brachioradialis reflex may be diminished.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C6-C7 paracentral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foraminal herniation or foraminal stenosis at C6-C7 affects the C7 nerve root and produces pain at the shoulder blade, pectoral area, and medial axilla with radiation to posterolateral upper arm, dorsal elbow and forearm, index and medial digits or all of the fingers, and sensory impairment in these areas. C7 radiculopathy can result in weakness of the triceps, pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis. Weakness involves the elbow extensors, and forearm pronators. There may be a diminished triceps reflex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C7-T1 paracentral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foraminal herniation or foraminal stenosis at C7-T1 causes C8 radiculopathy. Weakness can be present in the opponens pollicis, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and hand intrinsic muscles. Clinically, patients present with symptoms similar to an ulnar or median motor neuropathy and can have weakness of finger abductors and grip strength; they may also have findings suggesting median motor neuropathy. No reliable reflex test is available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central disc herniation at any cervical level &ndash; Large central disc herniation or any cause of spinal cord compression in the midline can produce a cervical myelopathy with bilateral upper motor neuron signs in the extremities.

The Spurling's maneuver (also called the neck compression test) is performed by keeping the head in a forward flexed, ipsilaterally rotated, and ipsilaterally tilted position. The modified Spurling's maneuver is performed by keeping the head extended, ipsilaterally rotated, and ipsilaterally tilted. Additional axial load by applying pressure on top of the head can be applied. Reproduction of symptoms beyond the shoulder is considered positive. Reproduction of neck pain alone is nonspecific.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This maneuver is highly specific for the presence of cervical root compression, but the sensitivity is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. One study, as an example, using electrodiagnostic testing as a reference, found a sensitivity of 30 percent and specificity of 93 percent for the Spurling's maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, a positive test is helpful, but a negative test does not rule out radicular pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Spurling maneuver should be performed with caution in patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis, cervical malformations, or metastatic disease since it may cause further injury to the spine in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper limb tension test &ndash; The Elvey's upper limb tension sign is a root tension sign for the upper extremity, akin to the straight leg raise in the lower extremity. The head is turned contralaterally, the arm is abducted with the elbow extended. Reproduction of arm symptoms is considered positive. The sensitivity and specificity of Elvey's upper limb tension test were 0.97 and 0.22 in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

However, in a series of 258 patients undergoing radiography for evaluation of neck-related disorders (axial cervical, upper extremity radicular, or myelopathic symptoms), flexion and extension views did not lead to findings that changed clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The additional expense and radiation exposure associated with dynamic views are not routinely warranted. Thus, the cervical series should include five views: odontoid, lateral, PA, and both oblique views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The lateral view demonstrates vertebral alignment; the normal cervical lordotic curve can be replaced by a straightened or even a reversed curve in moderate to severe cases of cervical strain. The lateral view is also used to screen for the degree of osteoarthritis (at the facet and paravertebral joints), disk space narrowing (osteoarthritis or radiculopathy), or bony pathology (compression fracture) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55348\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55348 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Oblique views are primarily used to determine the role of foraminal encroachment (osteophytes reducing the overall diameter of the neuroforamena) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78738\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78738 \">image 2</a>). However, radiographic presence of foraminal stenosis can both underestimate and overestimate the degree of foraminal stenosis because of the variable angle of the cervical foramenae.</p><p>Severe torticollis may cause a lateral deviation of the cervical spine that is best appreciated on a PA view of the neck.

MRI should be the first-line imaging study performed in patients with progressive signs or symptoms of neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. MRI should also be obtained if there is a suspicion for infection or malignancy. Some experts also believe that MRI is indicated for patients who have moderate to severe neck symptoms beyond six weeks, even if plain films are negative, although this is not a criterion in the American College of Radiology guidelines.</p><p>In the absence of risk factors for serious disease, MRI imaging is not necessary in patients with mild neck pain. Mild pain could be defined as self-described pain that is &quot;mild&quot; or other equivalent (a low numerical value on a pain rating scale less than <span class=\"nowrap\">3/10),</span> does not limit or interrupt daily activities (such as driving, desk work, or sleep), does not affect occupation, and is easily ignorable when distracted. Other reassuring features include waxing and waning severity over months and years, a reasonable response to mild analgesics and heat, &quot;gelling&quot; phenomenon (stiffness after prolonged single position), and an increase in symptoms with weather changes. Patients with moderate or severe chronic neck pain should undergo further imaging with MRI even in the absence of neurologic compromise when symptoms affect sleep, occupation, basic daily activities, or if the patient requires injection or surgical treatments. If there is a contraindication to MRI, CT is indicated.</p><p>Patients with dramatic bony tenderness combined with dramatic guarding of cervical movement should have imaging to evaluate for a possible occult fracture. CT scans show better definition of the fracture line than MRI, and can be obtained quickly in such patients who often have a difficult time lying still due to pain. In patients with acute whiplash injury, MRI findings showed limited evidence of specific changes compared to asymptomatic controls, suggesting little role for MRI in patients with this injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>MRI or CT also is indicated if referral for interventional procedures or surgery is being considered. Whether the patient is being sent to the spine surgeon, pain specialist, or physiatrist, further anatomic detail as outlined by the MRI along with clinical correlation define the most likely level for intervention. The choice of test varies with the clinical features of the patient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI detects soft tissue processes including disc herniations, foraminal stenosis, central stenosis, and tumor. MRI can also detect spinal cord changes from myelopathy, fractures, and infection. A noncontrast MRI is sufficient in the majority of cases.

Irritation of the dorsal root ganglion and the dorsal sensory afferent fibers can result in pain without motor injury.</p><p>The sensitivity of the needle EMG increases with the number of muscles sampled. One study demonstrated that sampling six upper limb muscles along with the paraspinal muscles was sufficient to identify cervical radiculopathy by EMG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood studies are not routinely indicated, but should be ordered, based on individual patient history and examination, when non-spinal causes of neck pain (ie, rheumatologic, infectious, or oncologic) are suspected. Serologic markers of inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein should be normal in degenerative causes of neck pain such as cervical radiculopathy, stenosis, myelopathy, discogenic pain, and facet syndrome. However, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may be elevated in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, or infectious processes such as septic discitis.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

The most severe injuries and wear and tear occur between C4 and C7, affecting the C5, 6, and 7 nerve roots. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several types of neck pain syndromes, including cervical strain, cervical spondylosis, cervical discogenic pain, whiplash injury, cervical myofascial pain, and diffuse skeletal hyperostosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Axial neck pain syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although cervical spine degenerative changes are the most common cause of neck pain, it is important to be aware of signs and symptoms that may indicate more serious pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70313 \">table 1</a>): history of trauma or cancer, unexplained weight loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/chills,</span> immunosuppression, intravenous drug use, chronic steroid use, and neurologic signs or symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Factors suggesting significant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination should include observation of neck movement, range of motion, palpation of the trapezius and paraspinal muscles, neurologic examination for radicular and upper motor neuron signs, and provocative maneuvers (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above). In patients with nontraumatic neck pain, radiographic imaging is indicated in the following circumstances (see <a href=\"#H964210303\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age &gt;50 years with new symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Constitutional symptoms (fevers, chills, unexplained weight loss)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate to severe neck pain lasting more than six weeks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progressive neurologic findings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infectious risk (eg, injection drug use, immunosuppression)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of malignancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of risk factors for serious disease, plain films are indicated in all patients with nontraumatic neck pain who are age &gt;50 years and have new symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H964210387\" class=\"local\">'Plain films'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be the first-line imaging study performed in patients with progressive signs or symptoms of neurologic disease. MRI should also be obtained if there is a suspicion for infection or malignancy and if there are moderate to severe neck symptoms beyond six weeks, even if plain films are negative. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'MRI or CT scan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography (EMG) testing can distinguish between peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes and cervical radiculopathy and should be considered when pain and dysesthesia is more prominent in the extremities than in the neck. Blood laboratory testing for patients with neck symptoms is not routinely indicated.
