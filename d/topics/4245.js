Natives in this region chew or brew coca leaves into a tea for refreshment and to relieve fatigue, similar to the customs of chewing tobacco and drinking tea or coffee in other cultures.</p><p>Pure cocaine was first isolated in the 1880s and was first used as a local anesthetic in eye surgery. It was particularly useful in surgery of the nose and throat because of its ability to provide anesthesia and constrict blood vessels, thereby limiting bleeding. Cocaine was legal and widely used in the United States during the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and was a main ingredient of the original Coca-Cola. Despite legislative attempts dating from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century to eradicate its use, cocaine remains a common and dangerous drug of abuse.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the basic pharmacology, clinical presentation, and management of acute cocaine intoxication. Treatment for chronic cocaine abuse, general management of acute drug overdose, and other aspects of drug abuse are discussed elsewhere. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70334 \">table 1</a>).

It accounts for more reports to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) than marijuana, synthetic marijuana, or hashish the next leading causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Death from unintentional cocaine overdose and cocaine-related violence occurs throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine is well-absorbed following contact with the oral, nasal, gastrointestinal, rectal, and vaginal mucosa, or via the pulmonary alveoli following inhalation. Cocaine's vasoconstrictive properties prolong the rate of absorption and delay its peak effect when absorbed from mucosal surfaces. The bioavailability of cocaine is approximately 90 percent when smoked and about 80 percent after intranasal use. Bioavailability is decreased when cocaine is ingested, though this is not well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The alkaloidal form of cocaine is extracted from the coca leaf by mechanical degradation in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent. The resultant product is converted into a hydrochloride salt and extracted into an aqueous phase, from which water is subsequently evaporated to yield a white powder (cocaine hydrochloride).</p><p>Smokeable cocaine is formed by dissolving the hydrochloride form of cocaine in water and adding a strong base. A hydrocarbon solvent is then added, the cocaine base is extracted into the organic phase, and the solvent then evaporated. &quot;Free-basing&quot; is a term used to refer to smoking or inhaling cocaine base following extraction and usually done on an individual basis. &quot;Crack&quot; is an analogous compound used in solid form that is produced on a commercial level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A table summarizing the time of onset, time to peak action, and duration of action for various routes of exposure is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57492 \">table 2</a>). These parameters were determined in volunteers with a history of cocaine use, by administering cocaine via the various routes and measuring serum levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolites &ndash; There are three major metabolites of cocaine: benzoylecgonine (BE) formed from spontaneous hydrolysis (&gt;50 percent), ecgonine methyl ester (EME) formed from metabolism by plasma pseudocholinesterase (32 to 49 percent), and norcocaine formed from metabolism by the p450 system (N-demethylation) (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">BE is a potent vasoconstrictor in vitro. BE and EME have poor blood-brain barrier penetration, so central neurologic effects are related to cocaine that enters the central nervous system prior to metabolism. EME is a vasodilator, sedative, and anticonvulsant, and is protective against lethal doses of cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In vitro, BE has minimal effect on cardiac sodium and potassium channels and in animal models it is virtually inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The metabolite anhydroecgonine methyl ester (AEME), or methylecgonine, is formed by pyrolysis (superheating) of cocaine. It has muscarinic receptor (M2) agonist properties that may contribute to bronchospasm.</p><p/><p>A transesterification reaction between ethanol and cocaine produces a unique agent, benzoylmethylecgonine, also called cocaethylene or ethyl cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In healthy volunteers given cocaine and ethanol, cocaethylene accounted for up to 17 percent of the metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Cocaethylene has a long duration of action (up to 13 hours depending on the route of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]), and like cocaine, is vasoconstrictive, cardiotoxic, dysrhythmogenic, and neurotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Cocaethylene is as potent as cocaine at inhibiting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> reuptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The serum concentration of cocaethylene varies by the route of administration of cocaine. Approximately 24 percent of cocaine is converted to cocaethylene when administration is intravenous, 18 percent when the drug is insufflated and 34 percent when cocaine is used orally. The physiologic effects of cocaethylene typically outlast the effects that would have been observed if cocaine alone was used by any of the common routes of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Cocaine's volume of distribution is about 2.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg,</span> and it is about 90 percent protein bound. It is unclear whether these values change in overdose states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The serum half-life of cocaine is 0.5 to 1.5 hours. A minor amount is excreted unchanged in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. BE and EME are excreted in the urine, and have serum half-lives of 5 to 8 hours and 3.5 to 6 hours, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine's effects occur primarily via three mechanisms, which are discussed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blockade of reuptake of biogenic amines &ndash; Cocaine is an indirect sympathomimetic agent, which increases the availability of biogenic amines at adrenergic receptors by blocking their presynaptic reuptake. These effects are described in neurons containing serotonin and catecholamines (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cocaine stimulates alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 adrenergic receptors through increased levels of norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent epinephrine. Cocaine has preferential alpha-receptor activity on the cardiac and peripheral vasculature and additional cardiac effects through beta-adrenergic agonism. The alpha-adrenergic agonist effects of norepinephrine cause vasoconstriction in both cardiac and peripheral vasculature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The euphoric properties of cocaine derive from the inhibition of neuronal serotonin reuptake in the central nervous system, while addiction has been linked to effects on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> reuptake. In animal studies, effects on the dopamine-containing neuronal systems traveling from the limbic region to the frontal cortex are strongly associated with cocaine addiction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium (Na+) channel blockade &ndash; Cocaine slows or blocks nerve conduction and acts as a local anesthetic by altering the recovery of the neuronal Na+ channels. Local anesthetics block conduction by decreasing or preventing the large transient increase in the permeability of excitable membranes to Na+ that normally is produced by a slight depolarization of the membrane. Cocaine has similar effects on cardiac Na+ channels and is able to slow Na+ current in cardiac myocytes. With severe overdose, these cardiac Na+ channel effects manifest on an electrocardiogram as prolongation of the QRS complex, and clinically as negative inotropy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excitatory amino acid stimulation &ndash; Cocaine increases the concentration of the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate in the brain, particularly in the nucleus accumbens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Aspartate has similar actions, although its exact role as a neurotransmitter is not as well defined; it is only active at certain subtypes of glutamate receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Aspartate also serves as a precursor for glutamate.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine produces a dose-dependent increase in heart rate and blood pressure accompanied by increased arousal, improved performance on tasks of vigilance and alertness, and a sense of self-confidence, euphoria, and well-being. Use is typically followed by a craving for more of the drug. Cocaine produces end-organ toxicity in virtually every organ system in the body, primarily through its hemodynamic effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5429611\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cocaine use is associated with arterial vasoconstriction and enhanced thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. It causes tachycardia, hypertension, increased myocardial oxygen demand, and increased vascular shearing forces. Cocaine causes coronary vasoconstriction in a dose-dependent fashion and is associated with cardiac ischemia in 5 to 6 percent of patients with cocaine-related visits to the emergency department (ED) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At high blood concentrations, cocaine's negative inotropic effects may cause acute depression of left ventricular function and heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Cocaine can cause supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias through direct actions at myocardial receptors or as a complication of myocardial ischemia. Aortic dissection and rupture occur rarely after cocaine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Chronic cocaine use can cause accelerated atherogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] and left ventricular hypertrophy, which increase the risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction, and can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the cardiovascular complications of cocaine abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5429618\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine can cause a variety of central nervous system (CNS) complications including psychomotor agitation, seizures, coma, headache, intracranial hemorrhage, and focal neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cocaine-induced psychomotor agitation can cause hyperthermia when peripheral vasoconstriction prevents the body from dissipating the heat being generated from persistent agitation. Mortality can be as high as 33 percent when hyperthermia develops in the setting of cocaine intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Psychomotor agitation occurs via several mechanisms. Cocaine causes an increase in the CNS excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate, and release of the excitatory neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>. The hyperthermia seen in cocaine-intoxicated patients is directly related to the extent of their psychomotor agitation and the ambient temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Seizures occur in approximately 3 to 4 percent of cocaine-related ED visits following acute or chronic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/29,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34</a>]. Seizures may occur after large doses in patients without an underlying seizure focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Headaches occur often and are likely due to neurotransmitter dysregulation or hemodynamic alterations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Cocaine is associated with both focal neurologic deficits and coma. Possible etiologies include vasoconstriction (ie, transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke) and intracerebral hemorrhage. Numerous reports describe patients with subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intraparenchymal bleeding associated with cocaine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. Other neurologic complications, such as paralysis from vasospasm-induced anterior spinal cord syndrome, occur rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5429625\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crack cocaine requires high temperatures to be vaporized and smoked. Angioedema and pharyngeal burns can occur when crack is smoked. Injury to the upper and lower airway occurs primarily from inhalation of heated fumes and is not a direct toxic effect of the drug.</p><p>Intranasal and inhalational cocaine use is associated with pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumopericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. These complications result from the Valsalva maneuver applied by the user to avoid exhaling the drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-complications-of-cocaine-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary complications of cocaine abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cocaine is associated with exacerbations of reversible airway disease and bronchospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Crack lung can also cause shortness of breath. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Crack lung'</a> below.)</p><p>Cocaine use is associated with vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], vasospasm, and enhanced thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This predisposes patients who use cocaine to pulmonary infarction. Patients with this complication usually present with shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, as well as the other findings that may be confused with pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. It is not known whether the risk of pulmonary embolism is increased among cocaine abusers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5429632\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal and renal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine users have a disproportionate incidence of perforated ulcers. Possible mechanisms include increased sympathetic tone causing increased gastric acid production or local ischemia in the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Cocaine is also implicated in cases of ischemic colitis, intestinal infarction, and metabolic acidosis. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction may be engaged in body packing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Body packers and stuffers'</a> below.)</p><p>Although less common, splenic and renal infarction can occur from cocaine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In cocaine users, minor abnormalities of liver enzymes are common and rarely associated with symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. More severe hepatic failure can be seen following hyperthermia due to psychomotor agitation. (See <a href=\"#H5429618\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5429639\"><span class=\"h2\">Other organ systems</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal &ndash; Patients with cocaine toxicity can present with a spectrum of musculoskeletal concerns. Signs can range from mild creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin elevation to electrolyte alterations (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia) seen with rhabdomyolysis. Patients can demonstrate a range of complications from localized or diffuse muscle pain to frank compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/15,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,53</a>]. Patients with severe rhabdomyolysis may have a lactic acidosis, life-threatening hyperkalemia, and renal failure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a>); for treatment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H25399006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmologic &ndash; Sympathetic stimulation causes mydriasis through activation of the dilator fibers of the iris. The pupil usually maintains its ability to constrict to light. Cocaine, like other mydriatic agents, can cause acute angle-closure glaucoma, and vasospasm of the retinal vessels can produce unilateral or bilateral vision loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Patients who smoke crack cocaine may develop mydriasis (unilateral or bilateral), suffer corneal epithelial destruction, or singe their eyebrows and lashes (madarosis) due to heat or direct topical effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/15,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy (pre and postnatal exposure) &ndash; Chronic cocaine use during pregnancy is associated with problems in fetal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Acute cocaine exposure in pregnancy is associated with abruptio placentae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The effects of in-utero cocaine exposure are discussed more extensively elsewhere.

Cocaine exposure can also occur via ingestion of cocaine or crack, typically when cocaine is left within a child's reach. The incidence of unintentional cocaine exposure may be as high as 5 percent among all children presenting to urban EDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Clenbuterol, another adulterant, can cause tachycardia, hyperglycemia, palpitations, and hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"#H5429510\" class=\"local\">'Adulterants and their effects'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5429510\"><span class=\"h1\">ADULTERANTS AND THEIR EFFECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5429517\"><span class=\"h2\">Levamisole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levamisole is a common adulterant of cocaine that can cause agranulocytosis, leukoencephalopathy, or cutaneous vasculitis, possibly leading to cutaneous necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/60-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-66</a>]. A review of published cases of levamisole-related toxicity noted that 52 percent of these patients presented with oropharyngeal complaints, while 27 percent presented with soft tissue infections or purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Exposure to cocaine adulterated with levamisole should be suspected in patients with these entities or complaints. Levamisole was used as an adjuvant treatment for colon cancer and an immunomodulator for various conditions and is now used primarily in veterinary practice as an anthelminthic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A small case series describes an association between levamisole and hyponatremia, but this phenomenon has yet to be formally studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p>The United States Drug Enforcement Agency first noted levamisole mixed with cocaine in 2003 and beginning in 2008 investigators in New Mexico reported that some patients who had been exposed to cocaine were developing agranulocytosis (confirmed by bone marrow histopathology). In 2008, levamisole was found in about 44 percent of seized cocaine, and by 2009, this amount rose to 69 to 73 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Analytical false positives are rare, as few xenobiotics are inappropriately detected by the BE immunoassay. Should test results and clinical findings be inconsistent, clinicians should discuss the matter with their laboratory director to determine what xenobiotics may have caused false results.

As such, sedation with a benzodiazepine, using an appropriate dose and route of administration, is first-line therapy for cardiovascular complications stemming from acute cocaine intoxication. Benzodiazepine therapy is generally sufficient to alleviate cardiovascular symptoms and signs. The dosing of benzodiazepines used for psychomotor agitation is described below, and such dosing is appropriate for the treatment of cardiovascular symptoms and signs. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Psychomotor agitation'</a> below.) </p><p>In patients with severe, refractory, or symptomatic cocaine-induced hypertension, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a> can be used to counteract the alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine (caused by norepinephrine release). However, the use of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents, such as phentolamine, may cause an increase in heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Suitable alternative medications for the management of refractory hypertension include vasodilators without beta blocking effects, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>. Phentolamine is given as an intravenous bolus.

There are no treatment goals specifically defined for cocaine-related hypertensive emergencies, but the initial aim of treatment in general hypertensive crises is to lower the diastolic pressure rapidly to about 100 to 105 mmHg; this goal should be achieved within 2 to 6 hours, with the maximum initial fall in mean arterial blood pressure not exceeding 25 percent of the presenting value. Cocaine-related hypertension should be treated judiciously given its usually self-limited nature (hypertension generally resolves when cocaine is metabolized) and the importance of avoiding hypotension. Treatment with benzodiazepines, possibly in conjunction with the medications discussed above (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>), is sufficient in most cases.

In such cases, hypertension should be managed based upon the patient&rsquo;s medical comorbidities and clinical status. </p><p>Cocaine toxicity usually causes hypertension, but massive toxicity may result in hypotension due to sodium-channel blockade, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac ischemia. Patients with hypotension are treated with intravenous isotonic saline. If hypotension persists after 2 to 3 L of rapidly infused isotonic saline, direct-acting vasopressors such as norepinephrine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> can be given and titrated to effect. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained, and if there are signs of QRS widening (suggesting sodium channel blockade), hypertonic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> should be administered at a dose of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> by bolus via a large bore IV.

This proscription in the acute setting is based principally upon theoretical concerns of coronary artery vasoconstriction and systemic hypertension, which can result from unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Details pertaining specifically to the issue of beta blockers therapy in the setting of cocaine use, and more generally to the diagnosis and management of the cardiovascular complications of cocaine use, are reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Psychomotor agitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Nevertheless, some clinicians may choose to give beta blockers as part of their management of acute cocaine-related cardiovascular complications.

The term body packer is used to refer to persons who swallow large quantities of prepackaged drugs with the intention of smuggling these drugs across international borders. Body stuffers are persons who swallow relatively small quantities of drugs in poorly constructed packets (usually in haste) to avoid repercussions from law enforcement agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].</p><p>Body stuffers with symptoms of cocaine overdose (eg, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, seizures, or cardiac dysrhythmias) are treated in standard fashion. Management begins with stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, and continues with gastrointestinal decontamination with either activated charcoal, whole bowel irrigation, or both. Presentation and management of body packers and stuffers is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastrointestinal decontamination is generally performed in patients suspected of body packing, body stuffers with a concerning ingestion, or symptomatic body stuffers, unless they are being prepared for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Activated charcoal reduces the lethality of oral cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The dose of activated charcoal is 1 g per kg body weight (up to 50 g), and should be administered by mouth every 4 hours for several doses. Whole bowel irrigation (WBI) with polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution is recommended in body packers for gentle evacuation of the gastrointestinal tract. WBI is given (usually via a nasogastric tube) at a rate of 2 L per hour in adults until the gastrointestinal tract is clear. Use of oil-based laxatives is not recommended because they reduce the tensile strength of packets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>The majority of the patients who sustain adverse outcomes has symptoms at presentation or within the first few hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p>In general, patients who present with acute symptoms from cocaine toxicity that resolve are observed for 6 to 8 hours. Patients who have returned to their baseline level of function can generally be discharged after this period with appropriate referrals.</p><p>Patients who present with cocaine-associated chest pain (CACP) are observed for 8 to 12 hours while two sets of cardiac biomarkers and repeat electrocardiograms (ECGs) are obtained. This assumes the patient is pain-free, or rapidly made pain-free, and has a normal initial ECG. Cardiac biomarkers are typically performed 8 to 12 hours apart. Although this is not the standard approach to the management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) unrelated to cocaine, the incidence of myocardial infarction in patients with CACP is extremely low (approximately 6 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/28,97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,97-99</a>]. For patients with CACP at low risk for ACS, observation in a chest pain unit is reasonable.</p><p>The results of an observational study of 59 patients with CACP at low risk for ACS suggest that such patients can be discharged safely after nonischemic ECGs, normal cardiac biomarkers, and a negative coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cocaine-acute-intoxication/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. However, further research is needed before such an approach can be recommended.</p><p>Patients in whom cocaine use is not the sole risk factor for ACS or who have a moderate or high TIMI risk score should be evaluated like any patient presenting to the emergency department with a possible ACS.

Among its more important effects are hypertension, arterial vasoconstriction (eg, coronary arteries), thrombus formation, psychomotor agitation (neurologic effects can range from agitation to seizures to intracranial hemorrhage), severe hyperthermia, dyspnea (from pneumothorax, pulmonary infarction, or other pulmonary injury), and ischemic bowel. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous drugs and disease states can mimic the cardiovascular effects <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychomotor agitation of acute cocaine overdose. A discussion of these is provided. A thorough history, including medications and preferred drugs of abuse, is often the key to diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzoylecgonine (BE), the major urinary metabolite of cocaine, is the analyte usually tested for. Cocaine is rapidly metabolized and detectable in blood and urine only briefly (ie, several hours) after use. BE can be detected in the urine for several days following intermittent use and up to 10 days or more after heavy use. Therefore, a drug assay &quot;positive for cocaine&quot; does not necessarily connote acute cocaine use. Additional testing is performed based on clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed approach to management is provided above.

If rapid sequence tracheal intubation (RSI) is necessary, we suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> be used because it can prolong the effects of cocaine and cause other complications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a>, may be used if RSI is necessary. Acceptable induction agents include: benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>.

We suggest initial treatment with a benzodiazepine, using an appropriate dose and route to alleviate cardiovascular symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Suitable dosing is described above (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Psychomotor agitation'</a> above). In patients with severe, refractory, or symptomatic cocaine-induced hypertension, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a> be used to counteract the alpha-adrenergic effects of cocaine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Phentolamine is given as an intravenous bolus. The usual dose is 5 to 10 mg every 5 to 15 minutes as necessary. We recommend that beta blockers, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, <strong>NOT</strong> be used in patients with acute cocaine toxicity because of the risk of cardiovascular complications from unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).
