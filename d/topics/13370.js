The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55616 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480785428\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a peptic ulcer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with peptic ulcers have no symptoms. Other people can have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the upper belly &ndash; Ulcers in the stomach often cause pain soon after a person eats. Ulcers in the duodenum often cause pain or burning when a person's stomach is empty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating, or feeling full after eating a small amount of food</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeling hungry</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. But if you have these symptoms, let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p>Sometimes, peptic ulcers can lead to serious problems. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding &ndash; This can cause smelly and black-colored bowel movements or vomiting blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hole in the wall of the stomach or duodenum &ndash; This can cause sudden and severe belly pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstruction &ndash; This is a blockage of the intestine. It can cause a feeling of fullness, bloating, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, belly pain shortly after eating, and weight loss.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480785435\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes peptic ulcers?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common causes of peptic ulcers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection in the stomach or duodenum caused by a type of bacteria called &quot;H. pylori&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs&quot; (NSAIDs) &ndash; NSAIDs include pain-relieving medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480785442\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a peptic ulcer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your doctor might do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check for H. pylori infection &ndash; Doctors can check for H. pylori infection by doing:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Breath tests &ndash; These tests measure substances in a person's breath after he or she has been given a special liquid to drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lab tests that check a sample of a bowel movement for the infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called an &quot;upper endoscopy&quot; &ndash; During an upper endoscopy, a doctor puts a thin tube with a camera on the end into a person's mouth and down into the stomach and duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>). Then he or she checks the lining of the stomach and duodenum for ulcers.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480785449\"><span class=\"h1\">How are peptic ulcers treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause, but most peptic ulcers are treated with medicines.</p><p>People with H. pylori infection are often treated with 3 or more medicines for 2 weeks to get rid of the infection. This treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine to reduce the amount of acid that the stomach makes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different types of antibiotics</p><p/><p>Some people need to take medicines that reduce the amount of acid for a longer amount of time. Some people take these medicines for the rest of their life.</p><p>It is important to follow all your doctors' instructions about taking your medicines. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects from your medicines.</p><p>People who have serious problems from their peptic ulcers might also need to be treated with surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480785456\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, people often have follow-up tests.
