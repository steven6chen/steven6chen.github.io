Reoperative thyroid surgery is technically challenging due to the presence of adhesions and scar tissues in the operative field, has different indications and strategies, and can be associated with higher rates of complications such as RLN injury and hypoparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/16,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22,23</a>]. </p><p>The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed before reoperative thyroid surgery, especially when options of nonoperative management exist (eg, for benign indications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/16,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22,23</a>]. Once the decision is made to operate, the surgeon must carefully review all operative and pathology reports from previous operations to determine the prior extent of disease and the visibility, location, and possible loss of parathyroid glands during the previous operations. In many cases, formal review of pathology slides from the previous surgeries may also be informative.</p><p>The timing of performing a completion thyroidectomy after a partial thyroidectomy that reveals thyroid cancer remains controversial but has not been shown to impact complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Many surgeons perform completion thyroidectomy either within five to seven days after the initial thyroid lobectomy before intense inflammation in the operative field has set in or delay the operation for at least six weeks to allow time for the inflammation to subside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159517350\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2048798749\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical prophylaxis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3163883777\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid surgery has a very low infection rate because it is a clean procedure performed in a well-vascularized area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

In a randomized trial, patients reported greater postoperative pain after undergoing thyroidectomy with than without neck extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Hyperextension of the neck can also lead to vertigo, headache, and postoperative nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients with known cervical spine disease should be assessed preoperatively by an orthopedic surgeon or neurosurgeon for the safety of performing neck extension. </p><p>The skin of the anterior neck, from the lower <span class=\"nowrap\">lip/angle</span> of the mandible to the anterior chest, should be prepared.

Efforts should be made to place this incision in an existing skin crease if possible. The incision length should be based on the size of the underlying thyroid gland as well as patient body habitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A longer incision may be needed if the patient is obese, the gland is large, or the neck is foreshortened as with kyphoscoliosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82297 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the incision, dissection is carried down to the platysma muscle. A layer that is only a few millimeters thick, the platysma muscle is divided along the course of the incision with cautery. Subplatysmal flaps are then elevated to above the level of the thyroid cartilage superiorly, over the sternocleidomastoid muscles laterally, and the level of the sternal notch inferiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58295 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The raphe between the strap muscles is opened in the midline avascular plane. Any enlarged lymph nodes in the midline prelaryngeal area (Delphian nodes) should be excised because they can portend locally metastatic disease. The strap muscles, which include the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles, are routinely preserved. However, if the thyroid tumor is adherent to or frankly invades the strap muscles, any involved portion of the muscles should be resected en bloc with the tumor to maintain a negative margin. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Dissection of the thyroid gland</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starting with the isthmus, one lobe of the thyroid gland is dissected from medial to lateral across the anterior capsule. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the lateral border of that lobe is reached, the middle thyroid vein should be identified and divided. The thyroid lobe is then rolled lateral to medial to display its posterior capsule and the tracheoesophageal groove, taking care not to enter the thyroid capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82298 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63713\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63713 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superior pole vessels are dissected out and ligated as close as possible to the thyroid capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81126 \">figure 7</a>). All thyroid tissues from the superior pole area are then removed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72167\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72167 \">figure 8</a>). The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve crosses the vessels close to the superior pole of the thyroid. Retraction of the superior pole in a lateral and inferior direction during dissection can facilitate visualization of the nerve. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection then continues down along the lateral aspect of the thyroid lobe. Mobilization of the superior pole may aid in the identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). The RLN should be identified in the tracheoesophageal groove and protected. Placement of an oral or nasogastric tube, an esophageal stethoscope, or a temperature probe facilitates identification of the tracheoesophageal groove and the RLN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inferior vascular pedicle, along with any other blood vessels going to and from the thyroid in its vicinity, should be ligated, which allows the thyroid lobe to be rolled up and onto the anterior surface of the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50925\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50925 \">figure 9</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ligament of Berry should be divided as close to the trachea as possible near the insertion of the RLN or its branches into the cricopharyngeus muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55871\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55871 \">figure 10</a>). Great care has to be taken with this step because the ligament of Berry is the most common site of injury for the RLN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74541 \">figure 11</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The isthmus should then be separated from the anterior aspect of the trachea, and the pyramidal lobe followed as cephalad as possible and resected en bloc with the thyroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55774\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55774 \">figure 12</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy, the dissection is then complete.

Once identified, parathyroid glands should be preserved in situ on their native vascular pedicles. The inferior thyroid artery supplies 80 percent of the parathyroid glands. Thus, the inferior thyroid artery must be ligated close to the thyroid capsule to avoid encroaching upon the branches supplying the parathyroid glands, which take off more laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56752\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56752 \">figure 16</a>). </p><p>Parathyroid glands should not be removed during thyroid surgery unless they are grossly invaded by a thyroid malignancy or become severely ischemic during dissection.

However, continuous IONM has the disadvantages of potentially causing vagal neurapraxia (if the electrode dislodges) or hemodynamic instability (eg, cardiac arrest) secondary to increased parasympathetic (vagal) tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It also requires dissection of structures (eg, vagus nerve) outside of the typical operative field, although a transcutaneous method of vagal stimulation for IONM during endocrine surgery has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1170598684\"><span class=\"h5\">Vocal fold response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vocal fold response to nerve stimulation is most commonly measured by a laryngeal surface electrode system built into the endotracheal tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. The endotracheal tube is positioned at a level that enables the vocal cords to come into contact with the electrodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>During surgery, the vocal fold response to nerve stimulation is displayed on a nerve monitor as auditory or visual electromyographic (EMG) signals. Changes in the pattern of EMG signals, which can occur with retraction of the gland, dissection of surrounding tissues, or dissection of the RLN itself, can alert the surgeon to possible nerve irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Because vocal fold response is measured by EMG activities, only short-acting muscle relaxants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, should be used during induction of anesthesia when IONM is employed.

Most studies examining the utility of IONM have been observational; the few randomized trials were small and underpowered. Existing data do not support that the routine use of IONM reduces the incidence of RLN injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/48-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-55</a>]. IONM, however, may be beneficial in procedures that are either high risk or performed by low-volume surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/48,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,56-58</a>]. High-risk procedures in this context typically include reoperations and those performed for thyroid cancers or goiters (retrosternal or toxic). </p><p>A 2009 survey of members of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons found that 14 percent of respondents used IONM routinely, 23 percent used IONM selectively, and 63 percent did not use IONM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Regardless of whether IONM is used during endocrine surgery, surgeons should exercise the same vigilance with surgical techniques to avoid RLN injury. When IONM is used, it is to augment, rather than circumvent, the need for meticulous surgical techniques, including intraoperative visual identification of the RLN. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3494895739\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative frozen section analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frozen section analysis during thyroid surgery should only be employed when it will have an impact on surgical decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Thus, intraoperative frozen section analysis is rarely required for papillary thyroid cancer diagnosed by preoperative FNA. However, frozen section analysis may be required to diagnose papillary thyroid cancer in patients whose preoperative FNA was suspicious or indeterminate, as FNA relies on nuclear features alone.

However, referral to a voice or speech therapist can help protect the patient's voice, reduce strain, reduce anxiety, and improve vocalization. The vocal cord should typically be reexamined at three and six months. Temporary vocal cord paresis usually resolves by six months. If the vocal cord is immobile for longer than six months, permanent paralysis is likely.

Chyle leak is reported in 1.8 to 8.3 percent of thyroidectomies, most often when a lateral lymph node dissection has been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chyle leaks can lead to severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances and even death if not treated properly. They are generally indicated by milky drainage, a bulging supraclavicular fossa, and induration or erythema of the skin. Low-output chyle leak (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> can be managed conservatively; high-output leaks require surgical ligation of the thoracic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Tracheal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tracheal necrosis secondary to excessive use of cautery on or around the trachea is a rare complication of thyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. The blood supply to the upper trachea is primarily from small branches of the inferior thyroid artery, which could be damaged during thyroid surgery. Tracheal necrosis can lead to air leak or subcutaneous emphysema and is potentially life-threatening. Any tracheal injury requires neck reexploration and construction of a tracheostomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While rare, esophageal and pharyngeal injury can occur with thyroid surgery. The finding of extensive crepitus in the neck postoperatively should prompt immediate evaluation for a pharyngeal or esophageal perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-esophageal-perforation-due-to-blunt-or-penetrating-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of esophageal perforation due to blunt or penetrating trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroidectomy is usually an elective operation, and any major medical issues should be addressed before proceeding to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hyperthyroidism should be medically optimized with antithyroid medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a beta blocker prior to thyroid surgery to avoid thyroid storm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Preoperative preparation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic thyroid ultrasound should be performed in all patients with a suspected malignancy, thyroid nodule, nodular goiter, or abnormality detected on other imaging modalities. Imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for the assessment of patients with extensive extrathyroidal disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative laryngoscopy or laryngeal ultrasound should be performed for patients with preoperative hoarseness or voice changes, extrathyroid disease extension, or bulky lymphadenopathy and for all patients undergoing reoperative surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine visual identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) decreases the incidence of injury and is regarded as the standard of care in thyroid surgery. Intraoperative nerve monitoring is an adjunctive measure that can be used to identify the nerve with the goal of reducing the risk of nerve injury but should not be relied upon as a substitute for good surgical technique. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dissection of the thyroid gland'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative nerve monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frozen section analysis during thyroid surgery should only be employed when it will have an impact on surgical decision making. (See <a href=\"#H3494895739\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative frozen section analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The requirement for immediate thyroid hormone supplementation after thyroid surgery depends upon the patient's diagnosis (benign versus malignant) and the extent of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> resection (total thyroidectomy versus thyroid lobectomy). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid hormone supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing total thyroidectomy are at risk for developing transient or permanent hypoparathyroidism postoperatively. Some surgeons prescribe calcium supplementation routinely after thyroidectomy to prevent symptoms of hypocalcemia, whereas others do so selectively based upon postoperative serum calcium levels. Patients should be counseled to promptly report hypocalcemic symptoms such as paresthesias. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Calcium supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarseness, uncontrolled coughing when the patient is talking, dyspnea persisting for more than 24 to 48 hours after thyroid surgery, or aspiration pneumonia should raise suspicion of potential vocal cord paralysis as a result of an RLN injury. Such patients should be evaluated promptly with a complete neurolaryngeal evaluation, including a direct laryngoscopy. Those who have severe or persistent symptoms should undergo surgical medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord to restore functions such as swallowing and phonation. (See <a href=\"#H3933138535\" class=\"local\">'Hoarseness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H122523\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injury/vocal cord paresis or paralysis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-thyroidectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rogers-Stevane J, Kauffman GL Jr. A historical perspective on surgery of the thyroid and parathyroid glands.
