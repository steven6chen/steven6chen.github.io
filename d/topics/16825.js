The term &quot;tardive&quot; differentiates these dyskinesia from acute dyskinesia, parkinsonism, and akathisia, which appear very soon after exposure to antipsychotic drugs. TD is a clinical diagnosis, but tests may be performed to exclude other causes of the patient's symptoms.</p><p>This topic will review the prevention and management of TD. Other aspects of TD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of TD and the early detection and treatment of potentially reversible cases of TD are of paramount importance. The only certain method of TD prevention is to avoid treatment with antipsychotic drugs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of antipsychotic drugs, particularly for longer than three months, requires careful evaluation of indications, and risks and should be limited to situations where there is no safer effective therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a> should <strong>not</strong> be used continuously for longer than 12 weeks.</p><p/><p>As an iatrogenic disorder, TD has medicolegal implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, it is important to inform patients of the risk of developing TD before treating with antipsychotic drugs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>. Although there is no consensus, some experts also advocate obtaining written informed consent from competent patients or from family members of patients who are unable to consent. Once started on these medications, patients should be monitored periodically for the development of TD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines for antipsychotic drug treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Psychiatric Association Task Force report on TD lists specific indications for short- and long-term antipsychotic drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This is particularly important since TD is often irreversible despite cessation of the offending drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical course'</a>.)</p><p>The Task Force made the following recommendations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term use of antipsychotic drugs in neurosis, depression, anxiety, personality disorder, and chronic pain states should be discouraged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even in schizophrenia or related chronic psychosis, efforts should be made to maintain patients on the lowest effective dose of antipsychotic drugs while reexamining the need for continued treatment at least every six months. After remission of a first acute psychotic episode, the dose of antipsychotic drug should at least be decreased, and probably best discontinued, within 6 to 12 months. Plans to continue treatment beyond six months require discussion with the patient and family regarding the indication for prolonged antipsychotic drug treatment and the risks of TD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Particular care is indicated for patients age 50 and older, patients with affective disorder, patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and negative symptoms, and possibly women. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since acute antipsychotic drug-induced parkinsonism and akathisia are an indicator of the extent of D2 receptor blockade, these adverse effects should be avoided by dose reduction or by use of a less potent agent. Drug-induced parkinsonism may also mask signs of dyskinesia. It is prudent to use the smallest effective dose required to control an individual patient's symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Except for prevention of acute dystonic reactions, chronic use of prophylactic anticholinergic drugs should be discouraged since they do not prevent TD and can aggravate the involuntary movements once they emerge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early antipsychotic drug withdrawal results in a better prognosis for recovery. Thus, patients on antipsychotic drugs should be carefully monitored for signs of TD at regular intervals with use of a standard dyskinesia rating scale such as the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F51103\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef51103 \">form 1</a>), which is useful to heighten awareness of mild manifestations of TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where possible, antipsychotic drugs should be tapered and discontinued as soon as the diagnosis of TD is made, although control of the patient's psychosis may ultimately be the most critical factor in the use of the offending drug.</p><p/><p>For patients who are developing signs of TD while receiving first generation (conventional) antipsychotic drugs, but still require treatment for psychosis, it is now considered prudent to switch to second generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs that may be associated with a lower risk for TD. However, there is no convincing evidence that altering the medication regimen ameliorates the course of TD once symptoms have developed. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Second generation antipsychotic drugs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Discontinuation of metoclopramide treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a> is used primarily as an antiemetic agent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> as a prokinetic agent for the treatment of gastroparesis. It should be stopped immediately if the diagnosis of TD is made, and alternative treatments of the gastrointestinal symptoms should be used. As a preventive measure, metoclopramide should not be used continuously for longer than 12 weeks.</p><p>The association of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and TD is discussed in detail separately.

Thus, prevention, early detection, and management of potentially reversible cases are the cornerstones of modern treatment.</p><p>When clinically appropriate, pharmacologic interventions may be considered for patients who are developing signs of TD. The two main strategies are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuation of the offending drug</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Switching from a first to a second generation antipsychotic drug</p><p/><p>For patients with a diagnosis of TD, additional pharmacologic interventions include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of benzodiazepines, botulinum toxin injections, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valbenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valbenazine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetrabenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetrabenazine</a> to control symptoms of TD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paradoxically, resuming treatment with antipsychotic drugs in order to suppress TD (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Resumption of antipsychotic drugs'</a> below)</p><p/><p>The need for drugs to control symptoms of TD should be carefully assessed, since symptoms are often mild and not sufficiently bothersome to require treatment. In some cases, family members are more disturbed by the involuntary movements than the patient, who may be relatively unaware of their clinical manifestations. However, this is more common among chronic or institutionalized patients than in ambulatory patients, many of whom are in psychiatric remission when TD appears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Discontinuation of dopamine receptor blocking agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When feasible, immediate tapering and discontinuation of the offending antipsychotic drug or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> is recommended if TD becomes apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Antipsychotic drug cessation (or dose reduction) must be carefully considered because of the potential for relapse or worsening of psychotic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The dyskinesia may abate within several weeks of drug cessation, but recurrence is possible if antipsychotic drug treatment is reintroduced.</p><p>The effectiveness of discontinuing the offending agent is not proven, since data are limited and no randomized controlled clinical trials have studied complete cessation of antipsychotic drugs for ameliorating TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A systematic review published in 2006 identified two trials that evaluated antipsychotic dose reduction versus dose maintenance in a total of 17 patients with TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pooled data showed that dose reduction was associated with a trend toward a clinically significant reduction in TD severity, but the findings just missed statistical significance (relative risk 0.38, 95% CI 0.1-1.0).</p><p>New onset dyskinesias may occur during antipsychotic drug withdrawal. Such dyskinesias often clear spontaneously over several weeks and do not require specific treatment. On the other hand, more persistent dyskinesia may recur if antipsychotic drugs are resumed, which should prompt the use of alternative pharmacologic management of the underlying psychosis.</p><p>Some patients with bipolar disorder do not require persistent therapy with antipsychotic drugs, as mood-stabilizing medications may adequately control the psychiatric symptoms. However, temporary reintroduction of an antipsychotic drug may be necessary if the patient has an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. When a high-potency antipsychotic is chosen, it should later be replaced by a second generation agent, preferably one with demonstrated low risk for TD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Second generation antipsychotic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some reports suggest that the second generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>] have ameliorating effects on TD severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, these observations may be due to either masking effects of the drugs or, more likely, due to an antipsychotic drug &quot;sparing&quot; effect, in which gradual improvement of TD occurs during treatment with weaker (second generation) rather than more potent (first generation) dopamine blocking agents. Thus, it is unclear if clozapine has definite antidyskinetic effects.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of eight uncontrolled open studies published in 1991, the response of TD to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> was variable and of uncertain significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in several later uncontrolled studies, clozapine produced an apparent therapeutic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. It has been particularly effective in some cases of severe tardive dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>], possibly related to its anticholinergic potency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quetiapine</a> appears to have a low or even nonexistent tendency to cause TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and may alleviate TD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]</p><p/><p>Although the available data are limited and somewhat conflicting, we suggest changing to a second generation antipsychotic drug in patients who are developing signs of TD if treatment for psychosis remains critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast to possible benefit in early TD, there is no convincing evidence that altering the medication regimen is effective for ameliorating the course of TD once symptoms have fully developed.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> is the preferred second generation agent in this setting, but requires frequent blood testing, as discussed in the next section. Clozapine has weak affinity for dopamine receptors whereas most of the other second generation antipsychotic drugs are potent D2 receptor blockers that carry the risk of causing or perpetuating TD. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> may be capable of exerting clozapine-like therapeutic effects in TD, the evidence supporting its use for ameliorating TD is limited.

Benzodiazepines operate through a GABA mechanism, but evidence of benefit in patients with TD is limited and inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>A systematic review identified four randomized trials that compared benzodiazepines with placebo, inactive control, or no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The trials included a total of 75 patients with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses who had neuroleptic-induced TD. In two trials with 32 patients, there was no difference between benzodiazepine treatment and placebo for clinically important improvement, defined as a &ge;50 percent improvement in any validated scale for TD (relative risk 1.12, 95% CI 0.60-2.09). A single trial in 21 patients found that more patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> had clinically important improvement compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> (60 versus 9 percent).</p><p>A fourth double-blind, randomized controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] was not included in the meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] because the data were only presented in graphs. In this trial, 19 patients with TD were assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> (2 to 4.5 mg daily) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At 12 weeks, clonazepam reduced dyskinesia scores by 35 percent compared with placebo. The reduction in dyskinesia scores was greater for patients with predominantly dystonic symptoms than for those with predominantly choreoathetotic manifestations (41 and 26 percent, respectively). Based upon the results of this trial, a guideline from the American Academy of Neurology concluded that clonazepam is probably effective for decreasing TD symptoms short-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in five patients participating in an open study carried out immediately following the double-blind study, the antidyskinetic effects disappeared after five to eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Although evidence of efficacy is limited, we suggest the use of low doses of a benzodiazepine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, to reduce both dyskinesia and associated anxiety in patients with mild TD.

Cervical dystonia requires highly individualized dosing, usually in the range of 150 units to start, increasing empirically to a maximum of 300 units according to individual clinical response.
