The risk of different events varies depending upon the clinical context, medication, and dose. Both nonselective NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAIDs (coxibs) increase such risk.</p><p>When thinking about cardiovascular risk for patients treated with NSAIDs, it is important to consider the duration and frequency of therapy. Unlike the gastrointestinal side effects, which can occur soon after initiation of therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity#H2134667089\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;, section on 'Nonselective NSAIDs'</a>), the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death is extremely small over a short course of therapy, as might be used for patients with an acute but limited musculoskeletal injury. It should be kept in mind that in clinical practice most patients do not use their NSAIDs as regularly as in randomized trials; thus, the rates and relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events in observational studies, reflecting typical clinical care, are frequently lower than in clinical trials.</p><p>The adverse cardiovascular effects of nonselective NSAIDs and the impact on clinical decision making will be reviewed here. The cardiovascular effects of coxibs and overviews of the adverse effects of NSAID therapy are presented separately.

There appears to be heterogeneous cardiovascular risk across NSAIDs, although precise risk data for many of these agents are limited. The adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-mechanism-of-action-major-toxicities-and-use-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin: Mechanism of action, major toxicities, and use in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITHOUT KNOWN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients in whom a nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is chosen for short-term (no more than a month) or intermittent use, we prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, rather than other NSAIDs. Other nonselective NSAIDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>) are reasonable alternatives, given the low baseline risk in such patients and lack of evidence regarding the cardiovascular risks of occasional low-dose use. Nonselective NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration required in order to limit adverse events. We also prefer naproxen to other nonselective NSAIDs for patients who require long-term (over a month) use.</p><p>Even in patients without known cardiovascular disease, most nonselective NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/1-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-13</a>]. However, the absolute increase in risk is small (one to two excess events or less per 1000 person-years) because the baseline risk in patients without known cardiovascular disease is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For most patients without known cardiovascular disease, this small increase in risk will rarely influence the decision whether to use one of these drugs.</p><p>Multiple factors, in addition to baseline cardiovascular risk, should be considered in deciding whether to use nonselective NSAIDs; these include the specific indication, the likely required dose of the drug, the other categories of medications that could be effective, comorbidities such as the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the duration of therapy.</p><p>In general, the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks appear to increase with higher doses and increased dosing frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/2,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Naproxen</a> may be an exception; an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke has been seen at lower doses (eg, 220 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], while at higher doses, where the drug may have a more sustained antiplatelet effect, some evidence suggests that naproxen might be safer than other nonselective NSAIDs with respect to cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/1-7,11,14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7,11,14-21</a>].

The analysis, published prior to the availability of data from the PRECISION trial (see <a href=\"#H1855299812\" class=\"local\">'Safety comparison between nonselective NSAIDs'</a> below), utilized data from over 300,000 participants in over 600 trials. In these trials, only 9 percent had a history of atherosclerosis. After follow-up of approximately one year, the meta-analysis found:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or vascular death) were increased compared with placebo for high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.12-1.78) and for the coxibs (ARR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14-1.66), largely due to increases in major coronary heart disease events. A similar, but statistically nonsignificant, increase in risk was observed with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (ARR 1.44, 95% CI 0.89-2.33). For these drugs, the risk of major coronary events was increased. The use of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> did not result in an increase in major cardiovascular events (ARR 0.93, 95% CI 0.69-1.27) or coronary events. The data regarding the individual nonselective NSAIDs are somewhat limited, contributing to wide confidence intervals, especially for ibuprofen, which reflect imprecision in the estimates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vascular death was increased by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> and by the coxibs (RR 1.65, 99% CI 0.95-2.85, p = 0.02, and 1.58, 99% CI 1.00-2.49, p = 0.01).

This randomized trial, involving 24,081 patients with arthritis, compared the safety of celecoxib (100 to 200 mg twice daily) with naproxen (375 to 500 mg twice daily) and ibuprofen (600 to 800 mg three times daily). Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were present in approximately 90 and 10 percent, respectively. Notably, approximately 75 percent of subjects had no known cardiovascular disease but did have at least one risk factor (eg, hypertension or diabetes). In the intention-to-treat analyses (truncated at 30 months) and on-treatment analyses (truncated at 43 months), the trial found that the cardiovascular safety of celecoxib was not inferior to either of the nonselective NSAIDs.</p><p>Depending upon the analysis, approximately 2 to 5 percent of subjects experienced a cardiovascular event during follow-up, which was slightly lower than expected in this moderate- to high-risk group. The numbers of patients who stopped the drugs were highly similar across the three groups, as were the proportion who were lost to follow-up. While some limitations of the trial have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], it has important strengths, including the extremely large number of patients, their clinical relevance, and the applicability of the study protocol to typical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2516387\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of developing heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of most NSAIDS is likely associated with a small increased absolute risk of the development of HF. All nonselective and cyclooxygenase (COX)-selective NSAIDS can induce fluid retention (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-electrolyte-complications#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Electrolyte complications&quot;, section on 'Edema'</a>). However, in the absence of significant underlying cardiovascular disease, it is uncommon for HF to develop after the initiation of therapy. Stated another way, the absolute increase in the risk of HF in patients with no prior cardiovascular disease is small. The most common situation in which HF might develop would be the patient with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The studies presented below, in the aggregate, suggest a small increase in absolute risk of HF among patients at low baseline risk:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2013 collaborative meta-analysis of data from randomized trials involving over 300,000 patients with a low baseline prevalence of atherosclerosis (9 percent), the risk of the development of HF in the placebo group was less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This risk of HF doubled with all coxib and nonselective NSAID therapy, and all nonselective NSAIDs had a lower risk when compared with the coxibs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2016 case-control study of patients starting NSAIDs between 2000 and 2010, over 90,000 patients from four European countries were identified who underwent hospital admission for HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Current use of an NSAID (within 14 days) was associated with a 19 percent increase in risk of hospitalization for HF; the risk was dose-dependent and present for most nonselective NSAIDs analyzed, although it varied between agents. A doubling of risk was observed at the higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piroxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piroxicam</a>.

However, the absence of an accepted biologic mechanism and the susceptibility of case-control studies to unmeasured confounders make us cautious about the strength of this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis, which identified six observational studies (one cohort study and five case-control studies) meeting eligibility criteria, with a total of 21,401 venous thromboembolic (VTE) events, found an increased risk of VTE (either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) in users of NSAIDs, compared with non-users (risk ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.28-2.52). The analysis was limited by marked heterogeneity between studies in study design, definitions of NSAID exposure, the population studied, and the magnitude of risk observed. Strategies to control for confounders affecting the observed association also varied widely. Given these limitations, the results of the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution, but the findings suggest a need for further well-designed studies to examine this question.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4980667\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison with alternative agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several COX-2 selective inhibitors (eg, rofecoxib) have been withdrawn from the market because of an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events. This issue is discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> or opioids have been suggested as alternative analgesics to avoid the cardiovascular risks associated with NSAID use when the antiinflammatory effects of NSAIDs are not required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; however, data from some observational studies suggest that use of these alternative agents may also be associated with various risks, including adverse cardiovascular effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/8,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30</a>].</p><p>There are no trials that directly compare the cardiovascular risks of nonselective NSAIDs with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or opioids, but retrospective observations in large cohorts or databases have examined this question in selected populations. The relative risk of major cardiovascular events with acetaminophen compared with no therapy was approximately 1.4 to 1.7 (dose-dependent); the relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events with opioids compared with NSAIDs was 1.8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects/abstract/8,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30</a>].</p><p>Even if the actual degree of risk with opioids is not as high as might be suggested from the limited data available, the potential for abuse limits the use of opioids; this must be factored into decision-making. For example, the very low risk of cardiac harm associated with nonselective NSAID use in a younger patient may be less than the increased problems associated with opioid use. Even in the older patient, where nonselective NSAIDs may have some increased cardiac risks, the risks of opioid use may favor the cautious use of a nonselective NSAID.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Patients with cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who require high doses of an NSAID for long-term use and who have known cardiovascular disease or are at high risk for cardiovascular events, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, rather than a nonselective NSAID (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).&nbsp;We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> to other nonselective NSAIDs, although there are few data evaluating other nonselective NSAIDs aside from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> in patients at high cardiovascular risk.

Thus, regular NSAID use should be avoided, if possible, in patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. In patients using prescription or over-the-counter NSAIDs on an occasional short-term basis, we suggest that aspirin be taken at least two hours before the NSAID (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
