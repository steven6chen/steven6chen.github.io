Anxiety is generally described as a feeling of helplessness or fear, often related to a sense of losing control that frequently accompanies life with illness, as well as being generated by death-related factors. A patient&rsquo;s distress may also be related to physical, psychological, social, spiritual, practical, end of life, and loss issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. They express fears about what their death will look and feel like and what events will lead up to it. They frequently voice concerns about religious beliefs, spiritual issues, existential matters, or how to achieve a good death. Some people with anxiety may require intervention and some may not. Often reassurance, presence, addressing their concerns directly, and controlling symptoms is all that is needed.</p><p>While many patients with serious illness have worries, fears, and apprehensions, they do not usually rise to the level of an anxiety disorder. That is, anxiety disorders should not be assumed to be an inevitable part of serious illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, for other patients symptoms of anxiety can be severely debilitating and require intensive treatment. At the most extreme, out of control anxiety can sometimes lead to a heightened interest in a hastened death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The detrimental impact of untreated, persistent anxiety was demonstrated in one multicenter study of over 600 patients with advanced cancer that evaluated associations between anxiety disorders and multiple endpoints, including physician-patient relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with anxiety disorders had less trust in their clinicians compared to those without anxiety. In addition, patients with anxiety reported being:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less comfortable asking questions about their health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less likely to understand the clinical information </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More likely to believe that their clinicians would offer them futile therapies </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less certain that they would have adequate symptom control at the end of life </p><p/><p>Persistent, high levels of anxiety are not adaptive and require aggressive intervention, including psychotherapy, anxiolytics, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Intervention by providers skilled in working with anxiety is needed whenever anxiety significantly worsens, interferes with the patient&rsquo;s ability to function, or persists for more than seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to diagnosis and management of anxiety in palliative care patients.

For example, in the Coping with Cancer study, 635 patients underwent a prospective evaluation to determine the presence of anxiety disorders using Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM IV) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, anxiety may be related to other quality of life areas, including the physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and practical domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A feeling of losing control in relation to the great uncertainty that accompanies many aspects of living with serious illness frequently heightens anxiety for many patients seen by palliative care.</p><p>Although the symptoms may vary in palliative care patients, common manifestations of anxiety include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional symptoms &ndash; Edginess, feelings of impending doom, or terror</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive difficulties &ndash; Apprehension, dread, fear, obsession, uncertainty, or worry</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral problems &ndash; Avoidance, compulsions, or psychomotor agitation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic symptoms &ndash; Diaphoresis, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, tachycardia, or tachypnea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expressions of fears about what their death will look like and what events will lead up to it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about religious beliefs, spiritual issues, existential matters</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worries about how to and if they will achieve a good death</p><p/><p>Noticing how the patient presents to the team or even what responses the patient evokes from the treatment team can be useful indicators of underlying patient distress. Patients with anxiety may seem inattentive, confused, and unable to take in information. These patients may ask the same questions over and over, or demonstrate difficulty making decisions, both of which may cause frustration for the treatment team. In addition, they may also appear inconsistent or even suspicious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Anxiety can accompany the fear of uncontrolled symptoms or concerns about loss of independence, and for some patients, their response may be expressed as a heightened interest in hastened death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21168261\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although patients with serious illness often experience anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], many patients may not directly express these symptoms to care providers, or articulate their experiences. As a result, it is important that clinicians listen for key words that can often signal underlying anxiety. This was shown in one study where the audio recordings of 415 visits between patients with advanced cancer and oncologists were reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Both anxiety and fear were the most common types of emotion expressed, and patients most frequently used the words &ldquo;concerned&rdquo;, &ldquo;scared&rdquo;, &ldquo;worried&rdquo;, and &ldquo;nervous&rdquo; to convey them. Being aware of these key words and noticing whether they occur during conversations with patients can aid the clinician in pinpointing the presence of anxiety. &#160;</p><p>Routine screening of anxiety should be carried out in palliative care patients, given the high prevalence of symptoms. For patients with cancer, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), along with the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=83708\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>) have issued recommendations for assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders, based upon Canadian practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The recommendations state that every patient with cancer should be screened for anxiety when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated, especially with changes in cancer or treatment status (eg, posttreatment, recurrence, or progression), as well as at transition to palliative care. We agree with this guideline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-psychiatric-disorders-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In our view, all palliative care patients should be screened for both anxiety and depression, and a reasonable initial tool is the brief Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F100637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100637 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. If the PHQ-4 screen is positive for anxiety (or if additional symptoms exist that suggest underlying anxiety), we suggest the seven-question Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77755 \">table 2</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The GAD-7 can be used to inform the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, the diagnosis of which is made on the basis of DSM-5 criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and to monitor the severity of symptoms over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H448541462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.), </p><p>If the patient screens positive for depression on the PHQ-4, we suggest that he or she be assessed for major depression or dysthymia using DSM-5 criteria for the disorders. If major depression is present, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) can be used to monitor its severity over time (eg, in response to treatment) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of depression in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Tools for assessment and diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H105621652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria and classification'</a>.)</p><p>The symptoms of anxiety may occur due to physiological derangements rather than from an anxiety disorder or psychological state (eg, due to heart failure, anemia, respiratory compromise, or hyperthermia) and this should not be overlooked. Good history taking and physical examination are both very important in the assessment of anxiety (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58758 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Physiological causes are particularly common if the symptom onset is after age 35, there is a lack of personal or family history of anxiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if there is a poor response to anxiolytic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with dyspnea, for example, can be very anxious; however, remarkable relief can usually be obtained with opioid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care#H89104056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic management'</a>.)</p><p>Important aspects in the assessment for anxiety include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed history and physical exam in order to attain a thorough sign and symptom profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and discern psychological versus physical contributing factors, including medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lifestyle contributions (eg, steroids, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing, including the measurement of electrolytes, blood cell counts, relevant hormones (eg, thyroid and adrenal), and toxicologies </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corroborative history obtained from family, friends, and other members of the interdisciplinary care team </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21168267\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hospice and palliative care settings, anxiety is common and can be a part of the normal reaction to a progressive, potentially life-limiting illness or the end of life. However, many symptoms of anxiety overlap with the symptoms associated with other psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, delirium, and dementia. For example, symptoms such as loss of appetite and insomnia are often associated with depression but can be a part of a patient&rsquo;s anxiety state or physical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1144565144\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of anxiety can be difficult to distinguish from depression, and the two can co-occur. For patients who may have a depressive disorder rather than (or in addition to) anxiety, a diagnostic assessment using DSM-5 criteria can distinguish between conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The anxiety and depression symptom scales discussed previously, PHQ-9 and GAD-7, can be useful to inform the diagnosis.

In contrast, patients with anxiety worry more about what might happen in the future. In addition, early morning awakening, diurnal variation in mood, and suicidal ideation are not typically present in anxiety and are usually associated with a primary depressive disorder.

However, unlike patients with anxiety, psychotic behavior, delusions, disturbance in consciousness, and altered cognition are common in delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

It is important that the clinician aim to distinguish these other conditions from a primary anxiety disorder. (See <a href=\"#H21168267\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in palliative care, symptoms of anxiety, anxiety disorders, and trauma-related disorders can manifest in various ways. The primary diagnoses in this population include adjustment disorder with anxious features, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. (See <a href=\"#H1144565197\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine screening for anxiety and depression should be carried out in palliative care patients. We suggest initial screening using the PHQ-4 tool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F100637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100637 \">table 1</a>). If the screen is positive for anxiety or depression, we suggest that the patient be assessed for an anxiety or depressive disorder using DSM-5 criteria. The severity of these symptoms can be evaluated using the GAD-7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77755 \">table 2</a>) and the PHQ-9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 3</a>) instruments, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H21168261\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treating symptoms of anxiety when an anxiety disorder is present, or for those with a GAD-7 score &ge;10, or when symptoms are interfering with function or quality of life. We advocate a personalized and engaged treatment approach that is based on developing a strong supportive relationship with the clinical team, augmented, if necessary by psychopharmacologic treatments, psychotherapy, and complementary treatments, including exercise and modifications of lifestyle factors. (See <a href=\"#H21168304\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients entering palliative care in whom anxiety symptoms warrant the initiation of medication, we begin a benzodiazepine. If symptoms do not improve or are severe, we add a selective serotonin reuptake. (See <a href=\"#H21168334\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom psychiatric symptoms complicate the management of the primary illness or are a major source of suffering, immediate referral to a mental health specialist should be undertaken. (See <a href=\"#H4919109\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral to a mental health specialist'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Payne DK, Massie MJ.
