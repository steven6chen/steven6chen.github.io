These include systemic autoimmune disorders, some infectious diseases, and certain ocular disorders.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features of retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections. Vasculitis of the retinal vessels due to local ocular inflammatory disorders and an overview of the classification of vasculitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with primary ocular disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic symptom of retinal vasculitis is a painless decrease in vision. Other symptoms may include a blind spot from ischemia-induced scotomas or floaters from vitritis. With macular involvement, patients may present with metamorphopsia (change in shape of an object) or abnormalities in color vision. Retinal vasculitis can also be asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in the retinal vessels may be observed upon physical examination. Funduscopic findings include vascular sheathing (visible accumulation of inflammatory cells along vessel walls) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54347\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54347 \">picture 1</a>) and vitreous hemorrhage. The peripheral vessels are often more involved than central arteries and veins, and there are frequently skip areas. With certain disorders such as sarcoidosis, lesions resembling candle-wax drippings or extensive perivascular inflammation may also be observed.</p><p>The retinal vascular abnormalities are better demonstrated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54057\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54057 \">image 1</a>). One of the main changes on fluorescein angiography is perivascular staining, which reflects the increase in vascular permeability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66049\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66049 \">picture 2</a>). Cystoid macular edema and capillary nonperfusion also may be seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We actively discourage a non-targeted &quot;shotgun&quot; approach to diagnostic testing among patients suspected of or at risk for developing retinal vasculitis. The diagnosis of retinal vasculitis is purely clinical and is made by fundus examination. Ancillary testing is more useful in delineating the extent and severity of the condition and is also helpful in ruling-in or ruling-out associated systemic morbidities.</p><p>Because of the wide variety of presentations, any ocular symptom in a patient with a known or suspicious diagnosis of a rheumatologic disorder should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Some of these symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased or blurry vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry eye symptoms (tearing, burning sensation, redness, irritation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lid inflammation or redness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye mucous discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular or periocular pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> periocular tenderness</p><p/><p>Once retinal vasculitis is definitely diagnosed, we recommend that the workup begin with a thorough history, review of systems, and physical examination to help narrow the differential diagnosis. Retinal vasculitis can be due to systemic, usually immune-mediated conditions, infections, or inflammatory disorders of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56959 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We therefore recommend a complete blood count, urinalysis, sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), chest radiograph, and syphilis and HIV serologies. However, it is important to emphasize that retinal vasculitis is an extremely uncommon manifestation of the classical systemic vasculitides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many times, retinal vasculitis is the presenting condition for a systemic disease. In a retrospective study, 42.5 percent of retinal vasculitis patients diagnosed in a single academic center, without known infectious or systemic disease, presented with their undiagnosed condition with retinal vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In cases in which the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is entertained, further evaluation is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Sarcoidosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, once a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis is entertained, the next step should be to determine if one of the systemic conditions described below is present. Establishing the correct diagnosis is essential if therapy and prognosis are to be optimized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasculitis of the retinal vessels may occur in association with a number of systemic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56959 \">table 1</a>), although, in a majority of cases, retinal vasculitis is not associated with systemic disease. One classification system for the retinal vasculitides associated with systemic disease is by the type and size of the involved retinal vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55568\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55568 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Knowledge of the systemic and ocular features in these disorders can help differentiate between the various causes.</p><p>Because of the wide variety of presentations, any ocular symptom in a patient with a known or suspicious diagnosis of a rheumatologic disorder should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist. These symptoms could include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased or blurry vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry eye symptoms (tearing, burning sensation, redness, irritation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lid inflammation or redness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye mucous discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular or periocular pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Beh&ccedil;et syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome characterized by recurrent oral aphthae, genital ulcers, and ocular inflammation. Minor criteria include arthritis, intestinal ulcers, epididymitis, vascular disease, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Involvement of the eyes is common among patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. In one series of 1700 patients in Japan, for example, ocular attacks were described in nearly 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In another study of 39 patients, 25 total eyes lost the perception of light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On average, vision was lost 3.6 years after the onset of ocular symptoms.</p><p>The loss of sight among patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome most commonly occurs in association with retinal vasculitis. The retinal veins are usually affected, being manifested clinically as recurrent retinal vasoocclusive disease in association with the permanent loss of vision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63242 \">picture 3</a>). In one Japanese study, patients with skin lesions and arthritis had an increased risk of visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Upon examination, patients with acute attacks of retinal vasculitis often have retinal hemorrhages and edema in association with vitreous cells, findings which have to be differentiated from those resulting from viral retinitis. Retinal infiltrates, branch retinal vein occlusion, neovascularization, and vitritis are common posterior pole findings. The use of multimodal retinal imaging, including color fundus photography, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography, and optical coherence tomography, is a useful way of following disease activity and treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Fluorescein angiography findings in particular have been able to correlate significantly with final visual acuity and are an important modality for following patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The use of ultra-wide fundus angiography and the angiography scoring of uveitis working group (ASUWG) grading system has been shown to be reliable in monitoring the retinal vasculitis in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Retinal vasculitis in Beh&ccedil;et can be treated with a variety of agents, including glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. The effectiveness, dose, and duration of therapy are based upon the patient response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> implant has been found to be effective for six months in posterior uveitis and retinal vasculitis associated with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The systemic treatment of ocular involvement in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) result from localized ischemia and may include involvement of the eyelids, episclera, sclera, cornea, orbit, retina, choroid, extraocular muscles, and optic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Retinal involvement is an under-recognized manifestation of SLE. Mild and visually nonthreatening manifestations of lupus retinopathy are common, consisting of cotton-wool spots with or without hemorrhages; they are observed in 3 to 30 percent of ambulatory and hospitalized patients with SLE, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A case of retinal vasculitis has been reported as the presenting condition for the diagnoses of lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cotton-wool spots represent edematous and ischemic neuronal tissue. While many of these small retinal lesions may be appreciated on funduscopic examination, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography may be helpful in diagnosing subtle lesions, so the prevalence of angiographic retinopathy is likely even higher than that cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Severe lupus retinopathy is characterized by severe ischemia because of vasculitic or thrombotic occlusion; it is observed more commonly in patients with active and severe systemic disease and, hence, correlates with decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/14,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-19</a>].</p><p>Retinal vasculitis in SLE typically affects the small arterioles and arteries and correlates with avascular areas on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography. More severe ischemia can result in neovascularization and hemorrhaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50474\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50474 \">image 2</a>). However, other nonspecific findings including capillary or venous dilatation, arteriolar constriction, and venous engorgement can also be seen in SLE. Very severe and sight-threatening retinal disease in SLE is typically associated with thrombotic occlusion of larger retinal vessels, findings that are often associated with antiphospholipid antibodies observed in antiphospholipid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The larger retinal vessels affected in SLE can lead to branch or central retinal vein or artery occlusion, leading to profound and irreversible vision loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72037\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72037 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>].</p><p>It is beyond the scope of this discussion to review the diagnostic criteria of the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, SLE patients presenting with acute occlusion of large retinal vessels should be evaluated for this condition, and relevant therapy, possibly including anticoagulation, should be instituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>].

Thus, patients diagnosed with the more severe variants of retinopathy should undergo a full systemic workup, with treatment focused upon systemic management of vasculitis and arterial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with extensive retinal ischemia that develop neovascularization should also be evaluated for laser photocoagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Giant cell arteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giant cell arteritis (GCA), or temporal arteritis, is a systemic vasculitis which primarily involves the medium-sized arteries. Ocular manifestations are frequent and include blurred vision, diplopia, and blindness. Ischemic optic neuropathy is the most frequent pathologic consequence within the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Patients may develop permanent blindness due to infarction of the optic nerve head. Any patient over 50 years of age who presents with transient monocular visual loss, even in the absence of scalp tenderness, should be evaluated for GCA until proven otherwise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The most common cause of visual loss in GCA is arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, due to inflammatory occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries; this accounts for 80 to 99 percent of visual loss attributable to GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Retinal involvement due to GCA is manifested as peripapillary cotton-wool spots, which represent nerve fiber layer infarcts. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is the second most common cause of visual loss in GCA, affecting up to 20 percent of patients with ocular involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The likelihood of visual loss decreases with early diagnosis and treatment of the arteritis.

Significant visual loss occurs in up to 8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>The retinopathy associated with GPA is characterized by involvement of the medium- to small-size arterioles; it occurs in less than 3 percent of cases, often resulting in cotton-wool spots and arteriolar occlusion, which are thought to occur due to external wall compression of tissue granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. The retinopathy associated with GPA is <strong>not</strong> the classic retinal vasculitis picture. This occlusive retinal vasculitis is less common than optic neuropathy or optic disc vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Because of the multifactorial pathophysiology of GPA, while mentioned here, it should not be placed in the same category as other diseases associated with typical retinal vasculitis presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].</p><p>Patients with ocular involvement are treated the same as other patients with GPA.

Other symptoms may include a blind spot, floaters, metamorphopsia, and abnormalities in color vision. Retinal vasculitis can also be asymptomatic. Abnormalities in the retinal vessels may be observed upon physical examination; the funduscopic findings include vascular sheathing and vitreous hemorrhage. The retinal vascular abnormalities are better demonstrated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography, with which one of the main changes is perivascular staining. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical characteristics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of retinal vasculitis is purely clinical and is made by fundus examination. Ancillary testing is more useful in delineating the extent and severity of the condition and in identifying or excluding potentially associated systemic morbidities. Once retinal vasculitis is diagnosed, a thorough history, review of systems, and physical examination should be performed to help narrow the differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing should include a complete blood count, urinalysis, sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), chest radiograph, and syphilis and HIV serologies. Additional testing depends upon the clinical assessment and upon the suspected underlying condition. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitis of the retinal vessels may occur in association with a number of systemic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56959 \">table 1</a>), although the vast majority of cases of retinal vasculitis are not associated with classic systemic vasculitis syndromes and are manifestations of the local (ocular) inflammatory process. Systemic disorders associated with retinal vasculitis include Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), various forms of systemic vasculitis, and others. One classification system for the retinal vasculitides associated with systemic disease is by the type and size of the involved retinal vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55568\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55568 \">table 2</a>). Knowledge of the systemic and ocular features in these disorders can help differentiate between the various causes. Treatment is determined by the underlying disorder but usually involves administration of systemic immunosuppressive agents. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Systemic diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying an infectious cause of retinal vasculitis is of critical importance since effective treatment may be available and since the incorrect administration of immunosuppressive therapy may be disastrous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56959 \">table 1</a>). The most common cause of infectious retinal vasculitis is toxoplasmosis, followed by tuberculosis, syphilis, and herpes viral infections. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Infectious causes'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stanford MR, Graham EM.
