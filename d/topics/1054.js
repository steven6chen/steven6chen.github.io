These include Gorham disease, desmoplastic fibroma of bone, pigmented villonodular synovitis (tenosynovial giant cell tumor), and symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas. Radiation therapy for other conditions affecting soft tissue, such as desmoid tumors, keloid, ganglia, and Dupuytren's contracture, is discussed separately.

There may also be significant osteoclast activation. Why this occurs is not clear, but increased levels of interleukin-6 may contribute to the osteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The pattern is that of lytic destruction of cortical bone and extension across joints to adjacent bone.

The first child presented with florid pulmonary failure and pleural effusion, the other with severe pain due to bone destruction of the pelvis and inability to walk. Both patients experienced clinical and radiologic response without major toxicities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DESMOPLASTIC FIBROMA OF BONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desmoplastic fibroma of bone, known as collagenous fibroma, is a benign tumor of bone that has a histological appearance similar to that of a desmoid tumor. This is an uncommon tumor that represents less than 0.1 percent of bone tumors. These lesions appear in young adults, with approximately equal frequency in males and females. Affected patients typically present with a history of a painless, slowly growing mass, often of relatively long duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>These lesions can also appear as soft tissue tumors; in these cases, the lesions are predominantly subcutaneous, but fascial involvement is common, and approximately one-quarter involve skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When they arise in bone, the most frequently involved sites are the pelvic and other flat bones, the jawbones, and for the long bones, the diaphyseal regions. The tumors are often large, ranging in size from 1 to 20 cm. They are firm and pearl gray in color on gross examination. The lesional cells are bland stellate and spindle-shaped fibroblasts separated by a collagenous matrix; there is typically no mitotic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A characteristic (2;11)(q31;q12) translocation has been reported in several affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The beta-catenin pathway does not seem to have the same essential role in the tumorigenesis of desmoplastic fibroma as it has in desmoid-type fibromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-molecular-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-local-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Desmoid tumors: Epidemiology, risk factors, molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and local therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Desmoplastic fibroma of bone is managed by surgical resection with extremely few exceptions. One patient with a 7.6 cm lesion in the iliac crest responded well to a course of fractionated radiation of 60 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], as did a patient with a mandibular lesion who refused surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Recurrent disease appears to be rare. In one study, none of 39 patients developed a recurrence at a median follow-up of 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TENOSYNOVIAL GIANT CELL TUMOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), historically known as pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), is a rare but well-recognized proliferative lesion of synovial tissue. It is characterized by hypervascular proliferative synovium containing multinucleated giant cells, macrophages, and hemosiderin. The multinucleated cells express features of osteoclasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Progressive nodular disease near or in the joints limits function and may destroy adjacent bone. Although most believe TGCT to be an inflammatory process, others consider it a benign neoplasm.</p><p>TGCT occurs in two forms: a diffuse form that involves the entire synovium and accounts for the majority of cases, and a localized form that involves a discrete section of the synovium. TGCT almost always involves a single joint; the knee and foot synovial structures are most commonly affected, while involvement of the shoulder, hand, and hip is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Plain radiographs may reveal well-circumscribed areas of bone erosion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a characteristic lack of signal on both T1 and T2 images, which has been attributed to the presence of large amounts of hemosiderin in the synovium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54059\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54059 \">image 1</a>). This MRI signature is an important key to correct diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436799855\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal treatment modality is resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Although marginal excision represents the optimal treatment for localized TGCT, diffuse TGCT is more difficult to eradicate and is optimally treated with total or near total synovectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovectomy for inflammatory arthritis of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The local recurrence rate among patients with localized TGCT is low, but patients with diffuse disease can have multiple recurrences and bulky disease, resulting in significant bone destruction. Among patients with diffuse TGCT, the addition of radiation therapy to a dose of 35 to 50 Gy has been suggested to decrease the local recurrence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>]. In the largest series of 50 patients, 49 of whom had microscopic or gross residual disease prior to radiation, 47 maintained local control at an average 94-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There are no randomized trials proving benefit. However, these data have been corroborated by published experience from at least two other centers as well as a national patterns of care study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/25,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29,30</a>]. In addition, an individual patient data meta-analysis of 35 case series reporting on 630 patients with TGCT of the knee found a significant reduction in the rate of recurrence of diffuse TGCT with perioperative radiation therapy (odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.70), although the authors concluded that the evidence was of very low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Postoperative intraarticular administration of radioactive isotopes has been advocated in the past for patients thought to be at high risk for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/28,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32,33</a>], but this approach has fallen out of favor.</p><p>Other novel therapies for TGCT are suggested by the biology of the tumor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In view of the documented presence of macrophages and related proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), in TGCT an intriguing report suggests control of signs and symptoms in a patient with refractory TGCT using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, a monoclonal antibody targeting TNFa, at a dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antineoplastic-therapy-for-miscellaneous-benign-diseases-affecting-soft-tissue-and-bone/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
