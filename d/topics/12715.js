Most major procedures traditionally performed with open thoracotomy can be performed using smaller incisions with video assistance. A related technology, robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS), uses computers to aid surgeon instrument control. The essential difference between VATS and RATS is that with VATS, the surgeon holds the instruments, whereas with RATS, the surgeon controls the instruments from the console and does not directly handle the instruments, but does directly control all aspects of the instruments' movement. In this topic review, we will use the broader term MITS to include VATS and RATS, using individual terms when specifically needed.</p><p>MITS provides safe, effective, and successful surgery when patients are selected appropriately. The indications have expanded as technology has improved. Continued outcome assessments are needed to ensure that MITS provides equivalent or improved outcomes compared with traditional open surgical methods. Quality of life assessments, morbidity rates, and recovery timelines also are important factors for comparison. Although few trials exist, many observational studies indicate that MITS has less perioperative morbidity and equivalent oncologic results compared with open operations. For special populations, such as frail and older adult patients, outcomes may be better. Generally, perioperative costs for minimally invasive procedures (both VATS and RATS) are higher because of the equipment. However, overall costs may be lower due to shorter length of stay and faster patient recovery.</p><p>The diagnostic and therapeutic uses of MITS, including an overview of the indications, the preoperative evaluation, procedures, perioperative care, and surgical outcomes, are reviewed here. Anesthesia for minimally invasive thoracic surgery is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pulmonary resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5713297\"><span class=\"h1\">THORACOSCOPIC SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the same manner in which laparoscopic techniques reduce the need for large abdominal incisions, minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS) eliminates the need for thoracotomy that requires spreading of the ribs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86029 \">figure 1</a>) or sternotomy incisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86046 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MITS uses a thoracoscope attached to a video camera to see into the chest. The lens and the instruments necessary to perform the surgery are inserted between the ribs and into the chest cavity through one or multiple small incisions. The basic principles used in open thoracic surgery (exposure, traction, countertraction) govern MITS as well, but the surgeon's hands remain outside of the chest cavity (or, in the case of robotic surgery, at a separate console), to manipulate and work the end of the instruments, which are located inside the chest.</p><p>The prevalence of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for more complex procedures has been steadily increasing, primarily because of reduced complication and mortality rates, particularly among frail patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In dedicated general thoracic centers, the use of VATS is approaching or has even surpassed open thoracotomy for pulmonary lobectomy. Tracking from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Surgery Database (STS GTSD) shows an increase in use of VATS anatomic lung resection (lobectomy and segmentectomy) from 8 percent in 2003 to 43 percent in 2009 from all participating centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An updated analysis of later cases shows that the rate of MITS (ie, VATS and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery [RATS]) use has climbed to 62 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], with such cases having fewer complications, decreased length of stay, and decreased chest tube duration in database analyses or case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1369653959\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of the term &quot;video-assisted <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracoscopic/thoracic</span> surgery&quot; (ie, &quot;VATS&quot;) is applied to multiple similar, but not identical, methods. There is variability in placement, size, and number of the incisions (also called ports) and the extent of use of the thoracoscope that is used to accomplish the surgery. To avoid instrument conflict, ports need to be spaced more than 8 to 10 cm apart, and the largest (utility) incision is generally placed within an interspace that is wide enough to allow multiple instruments to be passed and a large specimen to be extracted.</p><p>The terms &quot;VATS&quot; and &quot;thoracoscopy&quot; are often used interchangeably but are not always equivalent. A rough comparison of VATS and RATS approaches is given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110165 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VATS uses an access (or utility) incision that ranges from 2.5 to 8 cm in length and allows manipulation of multiple traditional or thoracoscopic instruments through the same incision at the same time. VATS can be performed with one (uniportal) or up to four chest incisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88295 \">figure 3</a>). The position of the incisions varies depending upon surgeon preference <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> procedure being performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Totally thoracoscopic&quot; or &quot;completely thoracoscopic&quot; or &quot;totally portal&quot; procedures use ports that are only large enough to admit a trocar <strong>without</strong> the use of an access or utility incision. This makes it easier to use carbon dioxide insufflation to maintain exposure but may require a larger incision to extract specimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other method of minimally invasive surgery in the chest is robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). RATS uses a unit that has multiple movable arms controlled by the surgeon at a separate ergonomic console. Robotic systems are more properly referred to as Computer-Aided Surgical Systems (CASSs) because there is essentially no robot movement without human guidance. The arms of the robot are fitted with trocars through which pass interchangeable slim instruments, including a video camera with three-dimensional optics. Excluding the camera arm, either two or three arms are used during RATS. Insufflation with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is usually used during RATS to aid in creation of space in the pleural or mediastinal cavity. Assistants are needed at the bedside to exchange robotic instruments or to pass tools that are not available for the robot through an additional port. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2305505787\"><span class=\"h2\">Learning curve and credentialing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The steep learning curve for performing MITS procedures more complex than pulmonary wedge resections, pleural biopsies, and hemothorax or empyema evacuation requires frequent repetition in temporal continuity and is hindered if case volume is low. Acquisition of these skills requires patience and persistence on the part of the surgeon learning the techniques. This particularly applies to the surgeon who trained before the era of widespread use of laparoscopy; learning these techniques with the benefit of a proctor can alleviate many missteps. </p><p>In a report that analyzed data for MITS from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Cancer Database between 2010 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], VATS for lung lobectomy was used in only 26 percent of all lobectomies, and RATS lobectomy accounted for 6.7 percent. A later report showed that general adoption of MITS for lobectomy was highly dependent on surgeon specialty (general thoracic surgeon highest), location (Northeast United States highest), and case density of the surgeon (&gt;15 per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, general thoracic surgeons predominated with a higher RATS rate (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reasons for the low percentage of MITS lobectomy are multifactorial, including the steep learning curve; lack of availability of equipment and instrumentation; lack of adequate operative assistance; low caseload of thoracic procedures in usual practice, making transition to therapeutic MITS impractical; and a staunch belief in the superiority of open procedures. </p><p>Each institution or hospital system at which a surgeon requests operative privileges has credentialing and privileging requirements that need to be satisfied and generally require a minimum annual case volume, demonstration of training, and mentoring of initial cases by intramural or external experts. The American Board of Thoracic Surgery (ABTS) requires residents who started their cardiothoracic training on or after July 1, 2012, to include 5 or 10 major <span class=\"nowrap\">VATS/robotic</span> anatomic resections for cardiac-focused or thoracic-focused residents, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In an anonymous survey, younger cardiothoracic surgeons included robotic cardiac surgery and robotic lung resection as areas where they felt technically less confident. There is currently no requirement from the ABTS regarding a minimum number of robotic-assisted cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An International VATS Lobectomy Consensus Group provided guidelines for defining technical proficiency for VATS lobectomy recommending performance of 50 cases with a minimum of 20 VATS lobectomy cases performed annually to maintain competency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Residency training centers under these guidelines should be able to provide 50 VATS lobectomy cases annually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2238424740\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Port placement, instrumentation, and quality of equipment can have a large impact on the safety and ease with which complex thoracoscopic procedures are completed. A sound knowledge of chest and pulmonary anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110287\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110287 \">figure 4</a>) facilitates understanding the three-dimensional relationships of the structures of the chest and mediastinum with the two-dimensional view of thoracoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-resection#H1694262613\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and bronchopulmonary segments'</a>.)</p><p>Chest structures that are accessible by thoracoscopy include the lungs, esophagus, pleura, diaphragm, pericardium, heart, thymus, anterior and lateral spine, sympathetic chain, thoracic duct, and mediastinal structures.</p><p>Compared with laparoscopic surgery in the abdominal cavity, the thoracic cavity provides some challenges but also some advantages. The chest cavity and the mediastinum are smaller than the peritoneal cavity, and incision placement needs to be planned carefully, taking into account the position of the patient's ribs, arm, diaphragm, and scapula. The chest has a more rigid structure and does not routinely require insufflation, but insufflation with carbon dioxide using airtight trocars is an option. Unlike the abdomen, insufflation is ineffective for expanding the overall size of the rigid thoracic cavity, but it can help compress a suboptimally deflated ipsilateral lung and help depress the diaphragm to increase relative operative working space. Avoiding insufflation allows the use of standard instruments or multiple low-profile tools through a single port, which can be an advantage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H773973510\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive approaches can be used for the diagnosis or treatment of benign or malignant chest diseases. Many procedures historically performed as an open thoracotomy are now performed as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). As surgeons become more proficient and technological advances in optics and instrumentation occur, the number and complexity of <span class=\"nowrap\">diseases/problems</span> that can be safely and reliably diagnosed or treated by thoracoscopy are growing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3035526845\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic thoracoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracoscopy was initially used mainly as a diagnostic tool until the 1970s for pleural diseases, particularly for tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Basic single-port diagnostic thoracoscopy may also be referred to as pleuroscopy and has also been referred to as &quot;medical thoracoscopy.&quot;</p><p>For diagnostic purposes, pulmonologists, general surgeons, trauma surgeons, and thoracic surgeons may use thoracoscopy to visually inspect the structures of the chest or to obtain fluid or tissue for histologic examination or cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>]. Pleural biopsy is one of the earliest procedures for which diagnostic thoracoscopy was used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110168\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110168 \">picture 1</a>). A variety of other tissues can be accessed for inspection or biopsy (eg, mediastinal nodes, diaphragm, lung parenchyma, pericardium, and esophagus) sometimes with greater ease compared with an open surgical, percutaneous, or endobronchial approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Also, if malignant pleural disease is discovered, thoracoscopy can guide pleurodesis or a placement of a drainage catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-evaluation-of-mediastinal-lymphadenopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Given that available robotic technology systems require at least two incisions (one for the camera and one for a robotic instrument arm), diagnostic robotic thoracoscopy is not a good use of resources. However, as technology advances, uniportal robotic capabilities will likely become available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28769966\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic MITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS) slowly gained momentum in the 1990s after the successes of laparoscopic operations such as cholecystectomy. MITS can be used to treat many conditions that have been predominantly managed using open surgery, including a variety of pulmonary, cardiac, pleural, mediastinal, esophageal, chest wall, and spinal problems. VATS has been used for tissue resection (eg, lobectomy, esophagectomy, thymectomy, sympathectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/19,22-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22-39</a>], therapeutic drainage or pleurodesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/18,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,40-43</a>], and reconstruction (diaphragmatic hernia, chest wall reconstruction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/19,20,26,29,44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,26,29,44-49</a>]. Robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) is another option for any of the procedures performed by VATS that would benefit from the three-dimensional binocular vision and wristed movements provided by the robotic platform, such as mediastinal cyst excision and lymph node removal, which require dissection from small, tight, irregularly shaped spaces adjacent to vital structures, and also for procedures that require suturing, such as bronchoplasty or diaphragmatic plication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>The most common uses for therapeutic MITS include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary resection &ndash; Pulmonary resection is used for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including primary lung malignancy (adenocarcinoma), metastatic disease to the lung, a variety of benign lung diseases when medical therapies are no longer effective, and more severe traumatic injuries. In addition, pulmonary resection is also a means of diagnosis for some pulmonary diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1487822491\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary resection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/chest</span> cavity &ndash; Pleural drainages (pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, malignant pleural effusion) with mechanical or chemical pleurodesis are approached commonly using thoracoscopy. Thoracoscopic decortications can be tedious depending upon the chronicity of the empyema or hemothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. Experience and judgement, appearance of the radiologic studies, and the patient's clinical course all contribute to the decision of whether to attempt these by thoracoscopy versus open thoracotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of malignant pleural effusions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of malignant pleural mesothelioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragm &ndash; For patients with phrenic nerve paralysis, the diaphragm becomes lax and attenuated and rises in the pleural cavity, causing compressive atelectasis, mediastinal shift, or lobar collapse with resultant dyspnea. Plicating or resection of the diaphragm expands the compressed lung and can be performed thoracoscopically or robotically. Thoracoscopic diaphragm plication improves pulmonary function testing with results that are comparable to those of open diaphragmatic plication. Increased use of RATS for diaphragm plication seems likely, particularly since suturing is markedly facilitated with the robotic platform. Insufflation with CO<sub>2</sub> also helps flatten the diaphragm, making thoracoscopic or robotic plication easier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-phrenic-nerve-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of phrenic nerve injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diaphragmatic injury can also be evaluated and repaired thoracoscopically, which is particularly helpful for repair of right-sided diaphragmatic rupture or hernia since the liver obscures the laparoscopic view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. Insufflation of the peritoneal cavity can occur, temporarily obscuring the field of view in the chest; however, the air can be evacuated from the peritoneal cavity by using a soft suction tube that can be removed once the diaphragm has been repaired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-management-of-diaphragmatic-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and management of diaphragmatic injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophagus &ndash; MITS for benign diseases of the esophagus and mediastinum allows successful treatment using smaller incisions. Most esophageal pathologies that are amenable to a thoracoscopy (eg, excision of esophageal diverticulum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110170\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110170 \">picture 2</a>)) are approached from the right chest cavity; however, the more distal thoracic esophagus (eg, myotomy for achalasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110171\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110171 \">picture 3</a>)) and the gastroesophageal junction (eg, distal esophageal carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110172 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110173\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110173 \">movie 1</a>)) leiomyoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110174\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110174 \">movie 2</a>) can be approached either from the left chest cavity or laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/36,38,59-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38,59-69</a>]. For esophageal resection for malignancy, retrospective reviews have found similar numbers and locations of lymph nodes biopsied, less time to recovery, and less pain for MITS esophagectomy compared with open esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/66,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,70,71</a>]. MITS is also associated with fewer complications (particularly pulmonary), particularly when the anastomosis is in the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/32,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,72,73</a>]. Complications that are relatively rare with open esophagectomy, such as tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal fistula, are increased with MITS esophagectomy, and their recognition requires vigilance in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Traditional methods of pectus excavatum repair once required complete or partial sternotomy, exposure and excision of costal cartilages, and sternal osteotomy or inversion. The Nuss procedure revolutionized pectus excavatum repair by using a minimally invasive technique to safely position a convex metal bar from one side of the chest to the other side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110175\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110175 \">figure 6</a>). The bar is then inverted 180&deg;, exerting upward pressure on the concave sternum. The thoracoscope is more commonly placed on the right side but may be placed from the left side. Bilateral thoracoscopy may be necessary if the pectus is severe. Prior to use of thoracoscopy, cardiac perforation was reported but was rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

The only absolute contraindication to VATS and RATS is the inability to achieve the working space needed if a patient cannot tolerate one-lung ventilation (eg, airway mass, prior pulmonary resection, severe pulmonary disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H553309\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Indications and contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>Selective ventilation is necessary to accomplish longer and more complex procedures. However, during brief periods of apnea, short procedures (eg, pleural biopsy, small lung wedge biopsy) can be accomplished safely without one-lung ventilation with frequent communication with the anesthesia team. The use of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) insufflation to aid lung collapse can be advantageous for certain procedures or situations, but this is less common and limits the choice of instruments because of the need to use gastight trocars. </p><p>Severe adhesions in the chest cavity are a relative contraindication. Thoracoscopy can be attempted, but thick fibrotic adhesions that are difficult to divide obscure the view and increase the risk of injury to vessels or <span class=\"nowrap\">intrapleural/mediastinal</span> structures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extend operative time to impractical levels. With complete fusion of the visceral and parietal pleura, there is no domain for the operation to take place. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2845111347\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful patient selection for complex minimally invasive thoracic surgical (MITS) procedures increases the likelihood of successful and safe completion. The operating surgeon should evaluate the patient anatomically and medically. Pulmonary function tests, including spirometry, lung volume measurements, and quantification of diffusing capacity, are performed preoperatively to identify high-risk patients who may not tolerate one-lung ventilation, which is necessary for most MITS procedures. (See <a href=\"#H614489535\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-resection#H3601660661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a>.)</p><p>Anatomic chest wall deformities or an elevated hemidiaphragm can limit optimal positioning or limit optimal access into the thorax and should be identified when considering video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Robotic surgery particularly requires adequate domain within the pleural space to allow optimal visualization and manipulation of the arms and instruments.</p><p>Manipulation of the thoracoscope and instruments through the chest wall will be easier in patients with normal or slender body habitus. Dissection may become difficult in obese patients as more adipose tissue obscures the normal planes between structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110976\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110976 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. Intra-abdominal obesity also elevates the diaphragm and reduces volume of the thoracic cavity. One advantage of robotic surgery in this situation is that the robotic arms fulcrum the instruments around a fixed point such that once the trocars are in place, the thickness of the chest wall does not affect their mobility.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest should be also performed within six to eight weeks of MITS, particularly if the suspected disease is dynamic. The CT protocol depends upon the nature of the pathology being evaluated for resection or repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-resection#H880674900\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Preoperative lung imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Lesions with surrounding inflammatory changes, such as an abscess, mycetoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with dense adhesions including calcified lymph nodes, are challenging to excise and present a higher risk of damage to adjacent structures. Inadvertent damage to major vessels or vital structures can result in excess bleeding or loss of ventilatory control, requiring conversion to thoracotomy. Inflammatory lung changes also create edema and fibrosis, making it difficult to divide the lung or judge whether an anatomic margin is sufficiently remote from the lesion. MITS decortication of a fibrothorax can be challenging because of the thickness of the adhesions that form a parietal rind and limit viewing and working space in the pleural cavity. </p><p>In the setting of prior coronary artery bypass grafting with a patent internal thoracic artery conduit in proximity of the operative field, proper planning for MITS is essential. Preoperative imaging studies, such as CT angiography, assist in delineating the course of the internal mammary artery (IMA) graft in order to avoid iatrogenic damage and possible cardiac ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. As with any thoracic operation that has the potential to jeopardize an IMA conduit, appropriate preparations should be made, including ensuring the availability of cardiac surgery, depending upon the anticipated risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19002712\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid cancellations, frustration, and technical mishaps, it is important to check that necessary equipment and instruments are available prior to the procedure. Surgical technicians should be familiar with how equipment is prepared and maintained. Education and training for new equipment and instruments is necessary for safe and efficient use. In certain circumstances, having a company representative in the operating room can be helpful until all personnel are comfortable with the equipment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141543450\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technological advances for minimally invasive videoscopic viewing include increased picture definition and improved illumination. The following scope options can be used based upon surgeon preference and technique-specific anatomic needs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard versus high-definition (up to 4K resolution)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 mm (standard) versus smaller, 5mm or 2mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrated (all-in-one) versus separately attached camera head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible versus fixed scopes with variable viewing angles</p><p/><p>3D binocular viewing is not only available within the robot console but also with <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/thoracoscopic</span> video systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110167\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110167 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>]. These have reduced operative times for lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Other technological innovations that are in progress include wireless video systems (alleviating the need for cords and small cameras) and lenses that can be mounted onto the chest wall, providing the ability to view from multiple vantage points simultaneously within the chest during procedure. Although 3D view is now available for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS), the depth perception gained still does not provide the large field of view during dissection of structures such as those in the hilum that is afforded during a thoracotomy. A low threshold for conversion to thoracotomy or sternotomy is imperative to maintain patient safety during the learning curve.</p><p>Thoracoscopic lenses can be separate and interlock into a camera, or the lens and camera can be one integrated unit. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110163 \">figure 9</a>). Lenses can be entirely rigid or can have a flexible portion or a rotating prism that allows a range of angled views. Rigid lenses are sturdier and less prone to damage but require that several lenses be available to view different angles, while flexible lenses allow different viewing angles without the need to change lenses. VATS is facilitated by using a variety of lens angles, from 0 to 45&deg;, for optimal visualization of the pleural and thoracic cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110176 \">figure 10</a>). Thoracoscopes are available in different widths, including 2- (needlescope), 3-, 5-, 8-, and 10-mm diameters, and are able to provide high-definition resolution and project enough illumination for excellent visualization, resolution, and magnification.</p><p>The video image is generally projected onto one or more monitors that are ideally suspended from the ceiling to allow optimal ergonomic positioning for the surgeon without conflict with floor-based equipment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110166\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110166 \">figure 11</a>). The number of monitors used depends on the surgical procedure and the number of operating surgeons. Typically, at a minimum, two monitors are used, one on each side of the table for the facing surgeon and assistant to view. Additional monitors facilitate preparedness and interactions by nursing and anesthesia personnel. High-definition resolution is an important adjunct that improves the visibility of structures within the chest or mediastinum by increasing clarity for precise dissection and reducing the need to zoom the camera to increase magnification. In addition to high-definition systems, the use of stereoscopic (3D) cameras has also improved the exposure and reduced the duration of more complex minimally invasive operations. While some newer monitors can display 3D images without the need for special eyewear, most medical 3D systems require the surgical team to wear glasses that enable such viewing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. The processing of images by the human mind is complex and quite variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. As an example, some individuals are dependent on stereoscopic (3D) optics to judge depth and can use different cues such as shadowing to process 3D imagery, while a minority are &quot;stereoblind.&quot; This helps explain the differences in popularity and adoption rates of certain minimally invasive platforms such as robotics that are based on integrated 3D optics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145394629\"><span class=\"h2\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many thoracic surgeons use the same instruments they would use for surgery through a thoracotomy incision. However, the use of open instruments may be hampered by the small length of the incisions, which do not accommodate the usual single-action ratcheting. Laparoscopic instruments can be used, but thoracoscopic equipment is generally shorter in length because the subcutaneous tissues and overall chest cavity depths are less. The shorter the instrument, the more control a surgeon has at the tip. For more complex procedures, streamlined instruments are more useful in order to fit multiple instruments through small incisions between ribs, the access incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110177\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110177 \">movie 3</a>), or the only incision when the uniportal technique is being used. Angulation of certain instruments, such as retractors, helps keep the shaft of the instrument out of the visual field of the thoracoscope, providing the surgeon adequate retraction without encumbering the view. Angulation also reduces instrument conflict when directed at the same target through the same port (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110178\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110178 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trocars &ndash; Trocars are available in different sizes that range from 5 to 15 mm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110179 \">figure 12</a>) to accommodate the instruments and the camera required to perform the procedure. If carbon dioxide insufflation is not used, 10- to 15-mm incisions for instrument passage can be made without the use of trocars, although trocars protect against soiling of the scope and lens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grasping instruments &ndash; Various types of handles and grips are available for thoracoscopic grasping instruments. Shafts may be straight or angled, cylindrical or ovoid. Grasping instruments designed for tissue manipulation include a head and a shaft and are available in a variety of shapes and configurations. A wide-head instrument, such as a thoracoscopic Pennington clamp (triangulated eyelet) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88235 \">figure 13</a>), allows for atraumatic retraction of lung tissue. Thoracoscopic single shaft forceps, such as DeBakey forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88237 \">figure 14</a>), are used for more precise grasping. Some grasping instruments work better with a locking ratchet, while others that require smooth movement are better without such mechanisms. Double action mechanisms on the shaft have the advantage of opening the instruments at the tissue level rather than opening at the port site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F88240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88240 \">figure 15</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting and coagulation &ndash; Thoracoscopic scissors are designed for wide blade opening at the target tissue level without widening the instrument shaft within the narrow port incision, while open Metzenbaum-type scissors can be passed through the access incision but can limit the ability to pass other instruments through the same port (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88248 \">figure 16</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Energy devices with different shaft lengths, tip sizes and shapes, and power sources are also available (eg, ultrasonic shears, bipolar, unipolar, argon gas, or radiofrequency) for tissue dissection and division and the sealing and ligation of vessels. Endoscopic disposable or nondisposable scissors with the ability for tip cauterization are used for delicate dissection or division. Some energy devices create smoke or steam that will obscure visualization. Saline-coupled (aka &quot;transcollation&quot;) bipolar cautery is helpful for managing diffuse parietal and visceral pleural surface oozing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of a suction device helps evacuate steam or smoke. If airtight seal exists due to the use of ports in all incisions to allow CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation or there is no extra room around any of the instruments, short bursts of suction will be needed to prevent lung inflation due to negative pressure. Opening the air vent on thoracoscopic trocars will also allow smoke and steam to vent but is more efficient if CO<sub>2</sub> is being insufflated. Controversy exists about whether inhalation of smoke generated from energy devices by operating room personnel is harmful with chronic exposure, and thus venting &quot;into the air&quot; of the operating room without a scavenging system may be discouraged. Specifically manufactured trocars are available for smoke evacuation and CO<sub>2</sub> circulation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suturing and stapling &ndash; Thoracoscopic needle drivers with precise thumb-index finger spring-style locking mechanisms are available, but conventional ring handle suturing tools can be used through the access incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88251\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88251 \">figure 17</a>). If extracorporeal knot tying is performed, knot pushers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88252\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88252 \">figure 18</a>), interlocking barbed sutures, and pretied knot devices can be used in addition to intracorporeal tying. Straight-shafted suture passers are helpful for placing stay sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88253 \">figure 19</a>). Disposable endoscopic suturing devices are available in a variety of suture sizes and materials. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thoracic endomechanical staplers are similar to those used for laparoscopic procedures. They are designed with a pistol grip leading to a cylindrical shaft to allow entrance through thoracoscopic incisions or ports. These are available for placement through a 5- to 15-mm port (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110180 \">figure 20</a>). The 10- to 15-mm size is more commonly used. Manual and powered linear cutting staplers provide either two or three rows of staples on both sides of tissue divided after deployment of the stapler. Anvil extension technology has allowed staplers to be passed around tightly grouped structures more easily. There is also a stapler for use with robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suction and irrigation &ndash; Standard suction devices are available in different lengths, tip sizes, and materials (eg, metal versus plastic). Additionally, if straight-shafted suction devices are needed to fit through trocars, 5- and 10-mm battery-operated combined <span class=\"nowrap\">suction/irrigation</span> devices are available. Straight-shaft or curved cylindrical 5-mm suction devices often become clogged or adherent to intrathoracic structures during suctioning and may not be as useful as combined <span class=\"nowrap\">suction/irrigation</span> devices. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue removal &ndash; To prevent dissemination of infectious microbes or tumor cells, retrieval pouches are used. The strength of pouch material ranges from thick plastic for easier-to-extract specimens to durable nylon to withdraw large specimens through tight rib interspaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Alternatively, specimens can be withdrawn through specialized &quot;wound-protector&quot; ports that provide exposure and prevent contact with tissues passed through them. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4098802518\"><span class=\"h2\">Robotic setup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasingly, robotic techniques are being used for thoracic surgery, although they are still not as prevalent as with other surgical specialties such as gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and urologic surgery. As more thoracic surgeons embrace the robotic platform, the development of improved robotic equipment and instruments will decrease the limitations of anatomic positioning between the ribs, sternum, scapula, diaphragm, and spine.</p><p>The room arrangement must be thoughtfully considered to accommodate the need for the robotic chassis to be roughly over the patient's head while allowing access for the anesthesiologist to reach the airway and perform bronchoscopy or tube adjustments, if needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112122\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112122 \">figure 21</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110164\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110164 \">picture 5</a>)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3910400620\"><span class=\"h1\">VATS VERSUS RATS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proponents of robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) believe that there is an easier transition from open thoracotomy to robotic surgery compared with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) due to the articulation capabilities of the robotic arms and instruments.

No large prospective randomized series are available. Comparisons are hampered by the fact that technical aspects of both RATS and VATS pulmonary resection are not standardized (including port positions, utility port incision size, instruments used) and are seldom specified. It is unclear where on the learning curve surgeons exist for different studies, and selection bias as well as publication bias are difficult to exclude.</p><p>The limited data thus far regarding thoracic surgery indicate that clinically important outcomes are similar for RATS and VATS at high-functioning centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/94-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-100</a>]. Definitive statements comparing RATS pulmonary resection with VATS await prospective randomized trials with greater control of technical variables, patient selection, and surgical experience levels. Since both are MITSs, it may be easier to conduct these trials compared with those that failed to have patients accept open operations when less invasive ones were available. The following studies represent typical findings in retrospective comparisons for various pulmonary resections.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study that compared 2498 robotic lobectomies with 37,595 VATS lobectomies performed between 2008 and 2011 found higher rates of intraoperative injury and bleeding in the RATS group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]; however, morbidity and mortality for RATS versus VATS lobectomy were similar in another study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

The arm on the operative side is supported by padded armrests that clamp to the operating table. Although stacked pillows can be used for arm support, regular-sized pillows may interfere with the anterior incision. &quot;Beanbags&quot; that stiffen to conform to the chest and hold the patient by vacuum, laminectomy rolls, padded bolsters or bed attachments, and specially formed cushions stabilize the patient in the decubitus position. The patient's waist should be centered at the level of the break in the operative table and supported by a &quot;kidney rest.&quot; When the table is flexed, the intercostal space is widened and the profile of the hip is lowered to facilitate the positioning and movement of surgical instruments.</p><p>The supine or prone positions are alternatives to the lateral decubitus position. Prone positioning is typically selected for posterior mediastinal procedures and requires special padding of the face and eyes and extra secure fastening of the endotracheal tube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961447177\"><span class=\"h2\">Incisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal port placement allows a greater range of operative field in the pleural or mediastinal space and helps with ergonomics. Surgeons need to be in a comfortable, relaxed position during procedures to facilitate successful and safe completion of the surgery, decreased risk of repetitive movement injury, and optimal visualization. The three-dimensional relationship of the operative field, ribs, scapula, diaphragm, and mediastinal structures are considered when making the incisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110181\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110181 \">figure 23</a>). In general, if ports are placed in triangular positions on the skin surface, the operation will proceed without the instruments blocking each other within the chest. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) uses a primary access or utility incision that ranges from 2.5 to 8 cm in length and allows manipulation of multiple traditional thoracotomy or thoracoscopic instruments through a single incision at the same time, though with the possibility of using additional 0.3- to 1.5-cm incisions. The term &quot;uniportal&quot; refers to the use of VATS through only one utility incision and is becoming more popular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incisions of totally thoracoscopic surgery are between 0.5 and 2 cm. At least one incision is necessary for camera placement. This same incision can be used to pass instruments and conduct the whole operation, if only a small procedure is required. Some thoracoscopes have a working port through which biopsies or fluid aspiration can be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110182\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110182 \">figure 24</a>). For more complex procedures, other incisions are added. The position for additional incisions is best determined under direct vision inside the chest to avoid adhesions or structures such as the heart and diaphragm and to facilitate passage and prevent crowding of instruments in the chest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incisions of robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) are positioned to allow adequate space for the movement of the robotic arms. Until 2012, when the endowristed robotic stapler received approval for use in the United States, an extra assistant port was necessary during procedures requiring endomechanical stapling. This port is also used as an extraction site and has been positioned in variable locations, including subxiphoid and transdiaphragmatic. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148400485\"><span class=\"h2\">Insufflation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some procedures in the chest and mediastinum may be aided with CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation. Situations where CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation is helpful are when there is significant emphysema with suboptimal lung deflation, anterior mediastinal procedures, and inability or desire not to attain selective lung ventilation. If CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation is used, different trocars with airtight seals will be necessary. The trocars used for robotic surgery allow for CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation. Care is taken to reduce the risk of CO<sub>2</sub> embolism through open lung parenchyma.

Common video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) procedures include biopsy, decortication, pericardial window, excision of mediastinal masses, esophageal myotomy, esophageal diverticulectomy, esophageal resection, chest wall resection, and pulmonary resection. Following clinically indicated VATS surgery, patients have equivalent or better outcomes compared with open surgery. Robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) can be used to perform all of the procedures currently performed using VATS; however, it is not as widely used, and there are less outcomes data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. However, early results from large databases seem to be equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3722383114\" class=\"local\">'Outcome comparison for pulmonary resection'</a> above.)</p><p>As technology continues to improve and surgeon experience increases, more complex and technically challenging procedures are being performed. Some of these include lung resection with en bloc chest wall resection, first rib excision, and airway procedures including sleeve lobectomy, bronchoplasty, pulmonary angioplasty, and tracheoplasty. Continued outcomes assessment is needed to ensure that VATS provides equivalent or improved outcomes compared with traditional open surgical methods. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4178509429\"><span class=\"h2\">Mediastinal lymph node biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy of mediastinal lymphadenopathy for diagnosis can be performed as the primary thoracoscopic procedure or at the time of planned lung or esophageal resection. Lymph node sampling for diagnostic purposes or full dissection during lung or esophageal resection for cancer yield comparable numbers of nodes for VATS compared with open procedures. While some large database studies suggested that there may be inadequate numbers of nodes retrieved by VATS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>], this was probably a statistical aberration caused by the avoidance of resection of central tumors that are lymphatic-rich. Later studies show uniform recovery of nodes in series as central tumors resected by minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. Sampling of lymph nodes for restaging can be more challenging if there are fibrotic or inflammatory changes related to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy can be performed via VATS technique, but care must be taken to avoid injury to the surrounding mediastinal structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56896%7ESURG%2F69492\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56896 graphicRef69492 \">figure 25A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/68,106-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,106-109</a>].

VATS thymoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110183\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110183 \">picture 6</a>) resection requires careful patient selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].

Although intact resection is usually the goal, if a cyst is densely adherent to trachea, bronchus, or esophagus, a small portion of cyst wall may need to be left behind. If left behind, surgeons generally attempt to ablate residual mucosa. Aspiration of a portion of the cyst contents during excision can be helpful for improved vision of underlying structures and allow cyst manipulation without rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>]. Sometimes surrounding inflammation from prior infection increases the technical challenge of removing bronchogenic or esophageal duplication cysts. Pericardial cysts may fluctuate in size, and it is unusual for them to become inflamed or infected. While easily resected, pericardial cysts generally are observed if asymptomatic. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the posterior mediastinum, excision of typically benign neurogenic tumors can be performed thoracoscopically. Complete excision of malignant neurogenic tumors may not be feasible using VATS if the mass is adherent to structures such as the aorta, trachea, or esophagus. Some neurogenic tumors will have a dumbbell shape with one portion extending into the spinal canal. A neurosurgeon may need to divide the involved nerve root using a posterior approach, before attempting a thoracoscopic approach to the tumor, which can often be performed as a single-stage operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1602451118\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest drainage/pleurectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drainage of hemothorax, empyema, or malignant pleural effusion and mechanical or chemical pleurodesis are some of the more basic problems that can be approached using thoracoscopy. Pleurodesis or pleurectomy (ie, decortication) can be indicated for recurrent pneumothorax or malignant pleural effusion. Experience and judgment, appearance of the radiologic studies, and the patient's clinical course all contribute to the decision of whether to attempt these by thoracoscopy or open thoracotomy.</p><p>VATS for pleural problems has equivalent success with regard to drainage of hemothorax and empyema with a faster recovery and decreased pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. The main determinant of success for VATS decortication is performing the surgery during the exudative or fibropurulent stages as opposed to the organized fibrotic stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].

The area of lung to be excised must be mobile, and resections that include a branch of pulmonary artery or draining vein will first require proximal vascular control to prevent bleeding with division of the lung tissue. If the lesion is small or not visible on the surface of the lung, instruments or a finger can be inserted into the chest cavity to palpate the lung and localize the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110185\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef110185 \">movie 4</a>). Landmarks can also be used to estimate where the lesion is located, but some interpolation is necessary as radiologic imaging is usually performed with the lung fully inflated, while surgery is performed on the deflated lung. If a nodule is expected to be hard to find, it can be localized by a variety of methods including computed tomography (CT)-guided methods, navigational bronchoscopy with dye marking, radionucleotide, and even real-time on-table imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>]. As with open thoracotomy, surgical staplers (&quot;endostaplers&quot;) provide fast and reliable hemostasis of the raw edge of resected lung and minimize air leak.

Reasons for conversion include bleeding, difficult anatomy, adhesions, challenging or inadequate lymph node dissection, and increased procedure complexity for oncologic reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/79,126,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,126,127</a>]. </p><p>Some studies have reported that anatomic lung resections using VATS result in decreased chest tube duration, decreased complication rates, and similar, if not improved, survival rates compared with traditional open incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/4,79,128-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,79,128-131</a>].

Several studies report faster recovery and shorter length of stay for MITS compared with patients who have had a thoracotomy with or without rib division [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/4,5,128,153\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,128,153</a>]. Postoperative care, including chest tube management, is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-resection#H211313391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Chest tube placement and management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2062750027\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, complications related to minimally invasive thoracic procedures are similar to those of the open surgical approach; however, some complications can be more significant. These include the potential for bleeding, and complications related to technical aspects of the surgery. A comparison of outcomes is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-resection#H271900476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Open versus minimally invasive lung resection'</a>.) </p><p>Bleeding may obscure the view from soiling of the scope, and bleeding from major vessels (eg, bleeding from a pulmonary artery, aorta) is of great concern and may require conversion to an open procedure for rapid hemostasis. Bleeding rates in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) series range from 0.4 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. There have been no cases in the literature of intraoperative death due to exsanguination during minimally invasive thoracic surgical (MITS) lung resection, but such events are almost certainly underreported. </p><p>Conversion to thoracotomy may be required due to bleeding or other reasons such as difficult anatomy, central tumor location with need for more complex vascular or bronchiolar reconstruction, or the inability to attain or tolerate selective lung ventilation. Reported conversion rates range from 1.6 to 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/106,154,155\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,154,155</a>]. </p><p>Injury to the diaphragm, liver, or spleen may occur, particularly during placement of the primary port, which is performed blindly without the benefit of the thoracoscope. Some methods to avoid this complication include careful imaging reviews to identify anatomic variations, starting with cephalad ports and viewing caudad to optimize placement of inferior ports; considering rises of diaphragm from atelectasis caused by single-lung ventilation; obesity; and, finally, placement of a port that allows camera viewing at its tip like that common in laparoscopic surgery. Diaphragm injuries are usually not serious though they require repair, whereas injuries to the liver or spleen can cause significant hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/155,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">155,156</a>]. </p><p>Port site recurrence has been reported following resection of pulmonary and esophageal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery/abstract/66,79,126,127\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,79,126,127</a>]. </p><p>Compression and injury to the intercostal nerves can occur with thoracoscopy. The discomfort usually improves, but in rare instances, chronic pain persists at thoracoscopic port sites. Intercostal nerve injury during robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) may be less compared with VATS because of the fixed point of the robotic ports; however, both are likely operator dependent and affected by choice of intercostal space and degree of torque generated at extreme angles of retraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19000460\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be performed using a minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS), either video- or robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">(VATS/RATS)</span>. These include intrathoracic biopsies (eg, pulmonary tissue, mediastinal nodes), resections (eg, pulmonary, esophageal), and chest wall resection or reconstruction (eg, pectus excavatum). (See <a href=\"#H5713297\" class=\"local\">'Thoracoscopic surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H773973510\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are purported benefits to performing some thoracic operations using a MITS, and in skilled hands the completeness of the operation is likely equivalent to the open approach in many instances. VATS and RATS have their own sets of relative advantages and disadvantages. The technology continues to improve, and the techniques continue to evolve. (See <a href=\"#H773973510\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3910400620\" class=\"local\">'VATS versus RATS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary function tests are performed to identify patients who would not tolerate selective pulmonary ventilation required to perform MITS. (See <a href=\"#H2845111347\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Much of the equipment and instrumentation is identical to that used during thoracotomy, thoracoscopy, and laparoscopy, although refinements (eg, angulation) have been made to facilitate performing complex MITS procedures. (See <a href=\"#H19002712\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquisition of MITS skills requires frequent repetition and is hindered if case volume is low. Guidelines vary on the number of cases that should be performed to demonstrate proficiency. The individual institution or hospital system generally sets their own standard for credentialing and privileging for these procedures, specifying demonstration of training, mentoring of initial cases, and a minimum annual case volume. (See <a href=\"#H2305505787\" class=\"local\">'Learning curve and credentialing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits of MITS appear to outweigh the disadvantages thus far, and increased experience and advancement of technology will help clarify which disease processes and procedures are improved by use of MITS. Although there are no prospective trials, observational studies support decreased perioperative morbidity, length of stay, pain, and recovery time following MITS compared with those of open surgery for lung resection, which is currently the most commonly performed MITS procedure. (See <a href=\"#H1487822491\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications after MITS are similar to those of open thoracic surgery, but some complications are unique to MITS. These include diaphragmatic or organ laceration from port placement and port-site tumor seeding, which can often be mitigated with preventive measures. Awareness of the unique morbidities associated with MITS may help alleviate the incidence as more experience is gained.
