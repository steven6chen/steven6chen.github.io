Palliative care may be provided along with curative or life-prolonging treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64252\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64252 \">algorithm 1</a>). In keeping with the family oriented approach, palliative care also extends to the family&rsquo;s bereavement period.</p><p>In addition to symptom management, other objectives of comprehensive palliative support include establishing goals of care that are in keeping with the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences; consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> care; psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support both to patients and their family caregivers; and coordination across sites of care.

Assessment methods designed primarily for care of actively dying patients or for research and quality improvement in palliative care are not discussed here; a more detailed review of the integrated care pathways for the actively dying, the approach to symptom assessment in palliative care patients, a general discussion of the benefits of palliative care, practical tips for discussing goals of care, and the philosophy and utilization of hospice care for patients with terminal illness are discussed separately.

To address the complexity of suffering, Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of modern hospice and palliative care, introduced the term &quot;total pain.&quot; Recalling one of her patient&rsquo;s testimonies, &quot;&hellip;The pain began in my back, but now it seems that all of me is wrong. My husband and my son were marvelous but they were at work and they would have to stay off and lose their money. Everything seemed against me and nobody seemed to understand&hellip;&quot; Dr. Saunders observed that her patient&rsquo;s pain included not only physical but also &quot;&hellip;emotional and mental suffering, her social problems, and her spiritual need for security and meaning&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Accordingly, the concept of &quot;total pain,&quot; which provides a defining framework for patient assessment in palliative care, refers to the complex mechanisms and manifestations of suffering, including its physical, emotional, socioeconomic, and spiritual components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11672020\"><span class=\"h2\">Diversity of individual experience of suffering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person's pain or malaise, <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> body image, the meaning of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> illness, <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> desires, relationships, and values or spiritual beliefs all contribute to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> experience of illness and suffering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, a precise, clinical taxonomy of suffering is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], because total pain is constructed in a highly individual way. There is no single, good way of facing a serious illness; likewise, there is no single definition of what constitutes a &quot;good&quot; death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Given the diversity of the individual experience of suffering, the specific palliative care needs and goals of individual patients are challenging to identify a priori or derive from population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For instance, surrogates of critically ill patients form their own &lsquo;clinical&rsquo; impression based on, among others, idiosyncratic, non-clinical factors such as the surrogates&rsquo; own &ldquo;gut feeling&rdquo;, optimism, intuition, and faith [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Preferences about essential aspects of palliative care, such as extent and timing of prognostic disclosure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>], provision of recommendations and degree of participation in medical decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], cancer patient preferences for quality versus length of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and location of palliative care or place of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], vary between individuals and may evolve over time; this underscores the imperative that palliative assessment should be routinely addressed over time. It also emphasizes that clinicians should be cautious about generalizing palliative care needs from one patient to another. A structured palliative assessment helps physicians identify personal values and beliefs and address incipient conflict about prognosis or intent of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H11672099\" class=\"local\">'Illness understanding and care preferences'</a> below.)</p><p>As an example, the design of the United States Medicare Hospice Benefit, seeking cost neutrality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], preselects patients for home care and requires a focus on comfort measures rather than access to all available treatments. Yet the common preference for home-based comfort is far from universal, ranging from 31 to 87 percent for home as a preferred site of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, in one study, as many as 48 percent of patients (versus only 5 to 7 percent of healthcare providers) considered access to all available treatments an important aspect of palliative care at the end of life, regardless of the chance of recovery. </p><p>The rank importance of common symptoms and care needs also differs between patients who have an advanced, life-threatening disease and their caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one study, patients with inoperable lung cancer self-reported a number of distressing problems that were not included in comprehensive clinical or research symptom questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In another, patients differed substantially from their physicians with regard to factors and priorities that impacted treatment decisions for their malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Other studies report that even the presence of a symptom as seemingly universally undesirable as pain is subject to individual interpretation and varying treatment preferences. One group found that only 29 percent of terminally ill patients who reported pain desired additional analgesic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Given the diversity of individual suffering, it is not surprising that a 2010 review of guidelines and policies from the US, UK, Canada, and Australia found few uniform sets of fixed patient expectations and clinical standards for palliative care. They concluded that &quot;palliative care staff have to continuously adapt their model of caring to the specific needs and values of each patient&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11672027\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpersonal sources of suffering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to individual sources of suffering, palliative care patients face anticipatory grief, which often leads them to relate to their families, communities, and professional caregivers with strong emotions. While these relationships are commonly supportive and adaptive, the distress felt by each of these parties (ie, patient, family, and clinician) may negatively impact the others. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the case of impending disease progression despite treatment, a patient&rsquo;s hope and trust in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> physician may, due to countertransference, be inadvertently associated with the emergence of grief and self-doubt on the part of the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These emotions, in turn, may affect therapeutic decisions and well-being of the patient, family, and the clinicians themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oncologists may report altered treatment decisions, mental distraction, as well as distancing or withdrawal from both the patients and their families as the patient gets closer to death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, a stronger doctor&shy;patient relationship was associated with lower prognostic accuracy on the part of the physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], a fact which could potentially alter a treatment plan. In a study of Medicare patients, individual physician characteristics (rather than the patients' medical comorbidity, age, race, or sex) had the strongest predictive value of the type of end-of-life care (eg, hospice versus intensive care unit [ICU] care) received by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p>These findings illustrate the need for comprehensive evaluation of not only the patient but also <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family, caregivers, and environment, as well as very close and ongoing introspection on the part of the physician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734218\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF PALLIATIVE CARE NEEDS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11672034\"><span class=\"h2\">Gaps in general medical assessment&nbsp;in palliative care patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional methods of clinical assessment (ie, the interview, physical examination, and diagnostic work-up) and care planning frequently miss many target symptoms for palliative care management, particularly in diseases other than cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Patients who have an advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening illness are frequently reluctant to discuss specific issues related to prognosis or advance care planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], while, on the other hand, physicians who lack a comprehensive, structured assessment approach risk underdiagnosing suffering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and failing to discern actual patient needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] or preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The discordance between patient-reported and physician-documented symptoms was shown in a study that compared 58 questionnaires completed by patients with advanced cancer and their paired physician-completed medical records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There was good concordance for pain (96 percent), but patients reported most other symptoms or problems more often than did their doctors (concordance rate 2 to 52 percent).</p><p>Others have shown poor concordance between physician&rsquo;s and patient&rsquo;s agreement on the salient aspects of the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and on whether or not end-of-life care options were discussed in patients with terminal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one report, oncologists caring for patients with metastatic cancer, whose subsequent median survival was six to seven months, discussed &quot;wishes about the care they would want to receive if they were dying&quot; with only 39 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As a result, 32 percent of the patients received care that was not congruent with their preferences. The lack of structured discussion of prognosis or assessment of what the patient knows may lead to misunderstandings. Indeed, one study found that a majority of patients with incurable stage-IV colon and lung cancer mistakenly believed that their malignancies were curable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14432240\" class=\"local\">'Ramifications of accurate illness understanding'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>Collectively, these findings suggest that individual sources of suffering, preferences, and palliative care plans for specific patients can be formulated only through comprehensive and uniquely structured palliative assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], which differs from traditional medical evaluation. Some data suggest that such a comprehensive approach improves the documentation of patient needs, but whether outcomes are improved remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H734093\"><span class=\"h2\">Unique aspects of palliative assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is a consensus on the domains of assessment, structure and process of care as well as quality metrics for palliative care and clinical programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], a standard format of clinical palliative care assessment has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In general, while including the traditional components of medical evaluation (medical and psychosocial history, physical examination), comprehensive palliative assessment involves unique content, focus, and sources of information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Content &ndash; </strong>Comprehensive palliative assessment includes six unique domains examined in a structured manner: pain and other physical symptoms; psychological, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms; illness understanding and care preferences (ie, personal goals, expectations, understanding of illness trajectory and risks versus benefits of therapies); existential and spiritual concerns; social and economic resources and needs of patients and caregivers, including for care in the home; and continuity of and coordination of care across settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Focus </strong>&ndash; The unit of care in palliative care consists of both the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family. Accordingly, comprehensive palliative assessment is patient-focused and family oriented. In addition, the patient&rsquo;s own frequently competing and evolving care preferences and goals, rather than solely pathophysiologic and clinical data, define the focus and organization of the assessment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sources</strong> and <strong>process</strong> <strong>for treatment planning </strong>&ndash; Rather than gathering information exclusively from the patient (or caregivers) and medical records, palliative evaluation utilizes a broad range of sources, each contributing to the final assessment. In an interdisciplinary manner, the physician collaborates with nursing staff, chaplains, social workers, therapists, and nutritionists to perform discipline-specific evaluative tasks, together developing the comprehensive palliative assessment. Tasks that are best shared with expert nonphysician team members may include evaluation of existential and spiritual domains, economic needs, and care coordination; however, specific distribution will vary depending on local expertise.</p><p/><p>The palliative assessment must be grounded in an attitude of openness towards the other person and being present to the other's suffering. When this occurs, the diagnostic evaluation itself may become a part of the therapeutic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This concept is embodied in the words of the Boston physician, Alfred Worcester, remarking on the care of the aged and the dying, who said &quot;In the practice of our art it often matters little what medicine is given, but matters much that we give ourselves with our pills&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Good communication skills are necessary. While assessing symptoms and burdens in a focused manner, we recommend incorporating open-ended questions and actively listening to the answers after questions are asked. This process is aided by using empathic comments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], reframing, speaking in the patient's own language and level of understanding, and exploring both the cognitive and emotional meanings of the response. Acknowledging and legitimizing the individual's values and concerns communicates respect, leads to an enhanced sense of dignity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and may reduce rates of anxiety and depression in the relatives of patients who are dying in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A subsequent referral for consultation and comprehensive assessment by a palliative medicine specialist should be obtained for problems that challenge the capabilities of the primary team. For instance, highly burdensome or refractory symptoms in a patient with an advanced serious or life-threatening illness (particularly pain, depression, anxiety, confusion, fatigue, breathlessness, insomnia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, or anorexia) should prompt palliative care consultation.

Burden prioritization can be streamlined with use of patient-completed responses, such as those included in the PEACE tool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F97481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97481 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11672064\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key psychological symptoms requiring assessment are depression (as distinct from adjustment and grief), anxiety, delirium, and coping with illness. Clinicians should screen for the multiple factors that increase the prevalence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of psychological distress (rapidly advancing disease, medications such as interferon or glucocorticoids, metabolic abnormalities, uncontrolled pain, impaired cognition, financial distress) and address them, if possible.

The impact of mood disorders in palliative care is underscored by one study that found mortality rates in cancer patients are up to 25 percent higher in those who experience depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>A variety of abbreviated screening tools for depression are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61549\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61549 \">table 10</a>). In general, abbreviated screening instruments, such as PHQ-2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663 \">table 11</a>) or a single-item inquiry (&quot;Have you been depressed most of the time for the past two weeks?&quot;), appear to be as effective as longer instruments to screen for depression.

Unlike depression however, demoralized patients remain capable of &ldquo;in-the-present&rdquo; pleasure (since the magnitude of their motivation is intact), and they perceive the source of distress outside of them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Anxiety may also be the result of a pre-existing anxiety disorder, substance abuse, delirium, or undertreated symptoms, most commonly pain. Significant factors that may exacerbate anxiety include concerns about future symptom control, the course of the disease, and other components of total pain. A screening item, &quot;Are you bothered by feeling nervous, anxious, or unable to stop worrying?&quot;, can be utilized.

Adaptive processing of stressors may utilize a variety of factors and styles, including humor, anticipation (planning, active management), disclosure and sharing with <span class=\"nowrap\">others/seeking</span> support, positive reframing, sublimation, and suppression (distraction, compartmentalization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In contrast, maladaptive coping strategies may include denial, venting, disengagement and avoidance, self-blame, anxious preoccupation, and substance use, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Ideally, adaptive coping results in enhanced functional, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing in spite of progressive illness. In contrast, maladaptive coping is associated with increased stress and higher burden of illness. In one study, for example, low scores on a basic component of effective coping, prognostic acceptance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], were associated with increased hopelessness, depression, and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Importantly, a patient&rsquo;s personality and native cultural paradigms can determine whether the emotion regulation style is adaptive or maladaptive.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A binomial categorization of coping styles into the so-called &quot;monitoring&quot; (attending to) and &quot;blunting&quot; (avoiding) styles has been sometimes invoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], but there is little evidence that this characterization aids in clinical practice, except possibly in tailoring the amount of information to be shared with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In one report, patients with a monitoring style of coping tended to do better when given more information, while those with a blunting style did better with less information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of breast cancer patients, expressive disclosure was associated with increased distress in those with baseline avoidance-oriented coping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p>Acknowledgment and experience of strong emotions associated with a life-threatening illness can contribute to adjustment, as long as those emotions are appraised by the patient and integrated into <span class=\"nowrap\">her/his</span> subjective illness experience and narrative. A successful integration usually involves one of the adaptive coping processes (listed above). For instance, adaptive coping may involve expressive disclosure to <span class=\"nowrap\">friends/family,</span> followed by reframing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seeking support. The clinician&rsquo;s role is to evaluate and facilitate the best adjustment styles; the presence of adaptive coping should be explicitly noted and commented on by the clinician to reinforce positive coping patterns. Advanced cancer patients with dependent children require particular attention and support in regard to coping strategies, as they are at high risk for psychiatric comorbidities, poor quality of life (QOL), and increased use of non-beneficial, aggressive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Patients should be asked directly about their coping with the illness; general screening questions such as, &quot;Have you had anything like this illness happen before? How have you coped in the past?&quot; or &quot;How are you getting through (coping with) this illness?&quot;, can be utilized. When the open-ended interview does not yield diagnostic information, focused questions, &quot;Does <span class=\"nowrap\">humor/planning/seeking</span> help and support, etc. help you cope with your illness?&quot;, may aid in defining the patient's adaptive style.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14431744\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychologic issues specific to caregivers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological distress and coping among family and caregivers must be assessed as well.

A benchmark of good palliative care is how well the administered therapies conform to the patient&rsquo;s informed <span class=\"nowrap\">preferences/goals</span> of care. Ethical and legal standards for discerning healthcare preferences of patients from the USA and most other Western countries are derived from the tradition of individual liberty and the corresponding principles of patient autonomy and informed consent. These subjects are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Legal aspects in palliative and end of life care in the United States&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important aspect of this assessment is an evaluation of decision-making capacity.

First, a comprehensive review of medical records, the history, and the physical examination provides the palliative clinician with an accurate understanding of the patient&rsquo;s illness and where it falls in the natural history of the condition. Prognosis and clinical trajectory, including complications, functional decline, and corresponding needs must be anticipated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Survival estimates in advanced terminal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thereafter, the patient&rsquo;s and family&rsquo;s understanding of the illness and preferences for extent of disclosure must be assessed. A dialogue, aimed at reconciling the clinical facts ascertained by the physician and subjective hopes and expectations of the patient, should follow. In circumstances of gross misunderstanding of the prognosis, or dissonance between expectations and feasible outcomes, the physician should, in a tactful manner that is respectful of the patient&rsquo;s cultural norms and individual preferences for disclosure, counsel and educate the patient and family. Lastly, the clinician should explore individual views on the level of minimum acceptable function (versus unacceptable impairment), therapeutic trade-offs (longevity versus QOL), as well as wishes for family involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-comprehensive-patient-assessment-in-palliative-care/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Patients&rsquo; values and preferences, their prognostic awareness as well as understanding of the illness trajectory, and treatment should be systematically assessed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F106616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106616 \">table 14</a>). Other models to guide the conversation about goals of care, including the REMAP stepwise approach, are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care#H106822465\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;, section on 'REMAP: A stepwise approach'</a>.)</p><p>A related assessment and counseling process, known as advance care planning, which is undertaken prospectively and sometimes ahead of serious illness, may result in preparation of documents such as an advance directive, living will, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> appointment of a healthcare proxy.

Concerns of atheist patients are frequently of a moral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> humanistic nature and can be evaluated, as long as the provider maintains respect for rationalism and nonbelief and withholds references to God. An interview question such as, &quot;This sort of illness often raises significant questions&hellip; How are you dealing with this?,&quot; communicates compassion and concern while facilitating assessment.</p><p>Another aspect of transcendent domain assessment pertains to life review.
