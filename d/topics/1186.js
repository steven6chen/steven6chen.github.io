The idiopathic interstitial pneumonias have been further characterized: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial pneumonia), desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease, acute interstitial pneumonia, and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important step in the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected interstitial lung disease is obtaining a complete history. Careful documentation of the past medical history is important in the initial assessment because the cause of the illness is often recognized from the patient's history. In addition to a thorough review of past systemic conditions and HIV risk factors, several other aspects of the history are particularly important and include the following features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Age and gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the ILDs are more common in certain age groups or have a male or female predominance. For example, the majority of patients with sarcoidosis, connective tissue disease-associated ILD, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and inherited forms of ILD (familial IPF, Gaucher's disease, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome) present between the ages of 20 and 40 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81455\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81455 \">figure 1</a>). In contrast, most patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, also called cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in Europe) are over age 50.</p><p>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis and pulmonary involvement in tuberous sclerosis occur exclusively in premenopausal women. Other diseases with a less pronounced female preponderance include lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, ILD in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and the connective tissue diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In contrast, ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis is more common in men. Because of occupational exposures, men are also more likely to have a pneumoconiosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Onset of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of symptoms prior to presentation may help focus the differential diagnosis. The acute or subacute processes (eg, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, connective tissue associated ILD) often share features with atypical infectious pneumonias, such as the rapid onset of symptoms, diffuse radiographic opacities, and fever (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80410 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>ILDs with a chronic or indolent presentation (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pneumoconioses) need to be differentiated from each other and from diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure.</p><p>Some ILDs, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis, may have an acute, subacute, or chronic presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Past medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any history of connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or malignancy might be a clue to an associated ILD, either due to the underlying disease or to medications used to treat the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56668\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56668 \">table 4</a>). A number of medications used to treat cardiac disease have also been associated with ILD, notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. A history of allergic rhinitis and asthma may implicate chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, while nasal polyposis and asthma may suggest eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss). An immunocompromised state due to an underlying disease or immunomodulatory therapy may suggest an infectious cause of ILD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of tobacco use is important, since some diseases occur largely among current or former smokers (eg, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis, respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) or among never or former smokers (eg, sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis).</p><p>Active smoking can contribute to complications in patients with Goodpasture's syndrome, in which pulmonary hemorrhage is far more frequent among current smokers. In this setting, it is thought that smoking damages the alveolar wall, making the alveolar basement membrane more accessible to the circulating antibasement membrane antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, different types of ILD (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis) may occur within a single family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Genetic predisposition'</a>.)</p><p>Familial aggregation and racial differences in incidence support the notion that sarcoidosis occurs in genetically susceptible hosts. However, the familial sarcoidosis studies clearly exclude a simple mode of inheritance, suggesting a more complex genetic background. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-sarcoidosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Possible etiologic agents'</a>.)</p><p>An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been reported for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), tuberous sclerosis, and neurofibromatosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Genetic predisposition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H20885999\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>).

Having ever smoked cigarettes was strongly associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that an interaction between environmental exposure and gene or gene(s) may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.</p><p>An autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance has been identified for Niemann-Pick disease, Gaucher's disease, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>].

The medication history should include over-the-counter medications, oily nose drops or petroleum products, and amino acid supplements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56668\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56668 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In some cases, lung disease may occur weeks to years after the drug has been discontinued (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a>).

Symptoms associated with acute radiation pneumonitis usually develop approximately four to twelve weeks following irradiation, whereas symptoms of late or fibrotic radiation pneumonitis develop after six to twelve months. Radiation recall pneumonitis can occur months to years after irradiation, when certain antineoplastic agents (eg, Adriamycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>) are administered to a patient who has received prior radiation therapy to the lung.

A strict chronological listing of the patient's entire lifelong employment must be sought, including specific duties and known exposures to dusts, gases, and chemicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The degree of exposure, duration, latency of exposure, and the use of protective devices should be elicited. The patient may need to obtain material safety data sheets (MSDS) from the employer, if it is unclear what exposures may have occurred in the workplace. A written questionnaire can be used to obtain this information in a systematic manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80757%7EPULM%2F62236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80757 graphicRef62236 \">table 1A-B</a>).

Symptoms may diminish or disappear after the patient leaves the exposure for several days and often reappear upon returning to the exposure. Thus, it is important to determine if the patient has had exposures to pets (especially any birds), air conditioners, humidifiers, hot tubs, evaporative cooling systems (eg, swamp coolers), or if there has been water damage to walls and carpets in the home or work environment. Family members may develop disease as a result of &quot;passive&quot; exposure to dusts from the hobby or occupation of another member of the family (eg, asbestosis, berylliosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ILD can present with a number of symptoms, and it is important to ascertain the duration, severity, and progression of symptoms. Most of the symptoms are nonspecific, but some will help to narrow the differential. In particular, patients should be asked about extrapulmonary symptoms that might suggest a systemic disorder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea &ndash; A sense of shortness of breath, ie, dyspnea, is a common complaint of patients with cardiac or pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In most instances, the patient has attributed the insidious onset of breathlessness with exertion to aging, deconditioning, obesity, or a previous unresolved upper respiratory tract illness. Some patients deny the presence of dyspnea even when questioned. This usually occurs because they have limited their activity and therefore rarely experience any significant discomfort. Frequently, a spouse or friend brings the problem to the patient's attention.</p><p/><p>Grading the level of dyspnea is useful as a method to gauge the severity of the disease and to follow its course (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55810 \">table 5</a>). However, some patients, especially those with sarcoidosis, silicosis, or pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, may have extensive parenchymal lung disease on chest radiograph <strong>without</strong> significant dyspnea. This most often occurs early in the course of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dyspnea&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-dyspnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of dyspnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sudden worsening of dyspnea, particularly if associated with pleural pain, may indicate a spontaneous pneumothorax.

In some patients, diffuse alveolar bleeding may be present without hemoptysis; the clinical manifestations in such patients may be dyspnea and an iron deficiency anemia. The new onset of hemoptysis in a patient with known ILD suggests a complicating malignancy.

However, pleuritic chest pain may occur in ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, and some drug-induced disorders.
