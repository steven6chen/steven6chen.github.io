It is essential that the correct cause be identified because appropriate therapy depends upon the underlying mechanism of the hyperthyroidism. From a pathogenetic viewpoint, hyperthyroidism results from two different mechanisms that can be distinguished by the findings on the 24-hour radioiodine uptake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76972 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism with a normal or high radioiodine uptake indicates de novo synthesis of hormone.

The treatment of Graves' disease and toxic nodular goiter and the diagnostic approach to patients with hyperthyroidism are discussed separately.

The overall prevalence of hyperthyroidism, which is approximately 1.3 percent, increases to 4 to 5 percent in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hyperthyroidism is also more common in smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Graves' disease is seen most often in younger women, while toxic nodular goiter is more common in older women.</p><p>In one prospective cohort study of adult women, the overall incidence of Graves' disease was 4.6 per 1000 during 10 years of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTHYROIDISM WITH A NORMAL OR HIGH RADIOIODINE UPTAKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperthyroidism with a normal or high radioiodine uptake indicates de novo synthesis of hormone.

It is an autoimmune disorder resulting from thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-receptor antibodies (also called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins), which stimulate thyroid gland growth and thyroid hormone synthesis and release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Stressful life events may be a risk factor for the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another risk factor may be a relatively high iodine intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Several drugs have been implicated with the onset of Graves' disease including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], interferon alfa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Activating somatic mutations of the genes for the TSH receptor have been identified in both toxic adenomas and nodules of toxic multinodular goiters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Similarly, activating mutations of the Gs-alpha protein have been identified in toxic adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>], but it is uncertain whether they occur in toxic multinodular goiters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other mutations must also play a role because, in one study, mutations in neither of these genes were found in 15 toxic adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Mutations of the TSH-receptor gene are most common; they were found in 15 of 31 toxic adenomas in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, the radioiodine uptake will be high only if sufficient time has passed for most of the administered iodine to be excreted. By comparison, the uptake will be low if iodine continues to be given or if the original preparation has a long biologic life because, despite the increase in thyroid activity, a recent exogenous iodine load will dilute the radioiodine tracer used to determine the uptake. These disorders are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

High levels of isoforms of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) with more thyrotropic activity are responsible for the hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Therapy is directed against the tumor. Thionamides are useful adjunctive therapy since hormone synthesis is occurring within the thyroid.
