(These are imaging tests that create pictures of the inside of the body.) When there are 2 or more spots on the lungs, it's called &quot;multiple&quot; pulmonary nodules.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2721516\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes multiple pulmonary nodules?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple pulmonary nodules are caused by either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer &ndash; Multiple pulmonary nodules can be caused by cancer that started in another part of the body and then spread to the lungs. Sometimes, multiple pulmonary nodules are caused by other types of cancer, called lymphoma or sarcoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that are not cancer &ndash; These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Different types of infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conditions that involve inflammation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clumps of abnormal blood vessels, called arteriovenous malformations (or &quot;AVMs&quot; for short)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conditions caused by breathing in harmful substances for many years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conditions caused by using illegal drugs like heroin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Scars from an old infection that happened years ago, such as from a fungus, tuberculosis, or chicken pox</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H592656677\"><span class=\"h1\">How will my doctor know what is causing my pulmonary nodules?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help figure this out, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and other medical conditions. He or she will want to know whether you worked around harmful substances you could have breathed into your lungs. If you have not had a CT scan done, he or she will order this test.</p><p>Your doctor will look at your X-ray and CT scan to see the sizes and shapes of the spots, and where they are in your lungs. He or she might be able to tell the cause of the nodules based on this information.</p><p>If you have old chest X-rays or CT scans, he or she will look at those to see whether the spots have changed over time. If the spots have not changed on CT scans from 2 years ago (or longer), they are unlikely to be cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H592656692\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my doctor order more tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor suspects that you have cancer, an infection, or inflammation, he or she will order more tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin test for tuberculosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on samples of mucus that you cough up</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test called a PET scan &ndash; If some of the nodules are <span class=\"nowrap\">1/3</span> of an inch or bigger, your doctor might order a PET scan. For this test, a doctor puts a substance into your vein through a thin tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; Then a special camera takes pictures of your lungs. This test can help tell whether pulmonary nodules are likely to be cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called bronchoscopy &ndash; For this test, your doctor will put a thin tube with a camera and light on the end (called a &quot;bronchoscope&quot;) in your mouth and down into your lungs. During this test, he or she can get samples of mucus from deep inside your lungs. Another doctor will look at the samples under a microscope and do tests on them.</p><p/><p>If the results of these tests are unclear and there is a chance that the nodules are cancer or a disease that needs treatment (like an infection), your doctor will do a biopsy. A biopsy is a test that can tell for certain what's causing your pulmonary nodules. During a biopsy, your doctor will get a sample of tissue from one of your pulmonary nodules. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p>There are different ways a doctor can do a biopsy. To get a sample of tissue from a pulmonary nodule, your doctor can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a needle through your chest and into a nodule in your lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do bronchoscopy to get a sample of tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do surgery to remove a pulmonary nodule</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H592656707\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens next?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on your test results and individual situation, your doctor will decide if you need treatment for the nodules.</p><p>If your nodules are caused by a condition that needs treatment, your doctor will talk with you about what he or she recommends.</p><p>If your doctor thinks your nodules are a scar on your lungs, you probably won't need treatment. But you might need follow-up visits or CT scans to make sure your condition doesn't change or worsen over time. How often the scans are done depends on your individual situation. Most people have repeat CT scans over the course of about 2 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H592656724\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lung cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tuberculosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lymphoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kaposi-sarcoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kaposi sarcoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-nodule-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pulmonary nodule (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
