Some populations may be at greater risk for vitamin K deficiency (eg, poor nutrition). Administration of a small daily dose of vitamin K has been tested in several studies and two randomized trials, only one of which has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. A 2016 systematic review that included 15 studies (1838 patients) concluded that the use of daily vitamin K at a very small dose (range, 100 to 500 mcg daily) may be associated with a clinically relevant improvement in the TTR, but there is no clinically relevant benefit to using this approach in unselected populations receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The dose must be sufficient to blunt large changes in <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> but low enough that it does not interfere with anticoagulation. In the published trial, 70 patients with unexplained poor INR control were randomly assigned to receive 150 mcg of daily vitamin K or placebo for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Compared with controls, individuals receiving low-dose vitamin K had less variability in <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> measurements and the increase in the therapeutic range (TTR) was greater (28 versus 15 percent). Additional studies also suggest that low-dose oral vitamin K, in the range of 100 to 200 mcg orally per day, may improve INR control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].
