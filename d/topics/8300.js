The etiology and management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common causes of hoarseness in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Hoarseness&quot; or &quot;dysphonia&quot; are the terms used to describe a change in the quality of the voice. The voice quality can be breathy, strained, fatigued, rough, tremulous, or weak. It may have a change in pitch or abnormal resonance. The prevalence of hoarseness in children ranges from 4 to 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The causes of hoarseness in children vary by age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73274 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most of these disease processes are benign and respond well to medical and speech therapy.</p><p>The history and physical examination, including laryngoscopy, and if possible, stroboscopy, will determine the etiology in the majority of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The larynx is part of the anterior hypopharynx. In newborns, the larynx is situated at the level of C3-C4, where it facilitates simultaneous respiration and swallowing during infant feeding. It gradually descends to the level of C6-C7 by the age of 15 years. The hyoid bone, a mobile, crescent-shaped bone, forms the anterior upper limit of the larynx, which is divided into three regions relative to the level of the vocal cords:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The supraglottic region encompasses the area above the vocal folds and includes the epiglottis, arytenoids, aryepiglottic folds, and false vocal folds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glottic region includes the vocal folds and the region immediately below the vocal folds. This region has the narrowest diameter in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subglottic region refers to the region starting 1 cm below the vocal folds and ending in the upper cervical trachea. This region corresponds to the cricoid cartilage and has the narrowest diameter in infants and children.</p><p/><p>The larynx is formed by the articulation of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79855 \">figure 1</a>). The ring-shaped cricoid cartilage is the only cartilage that completely encircles the airway. The epiglottis and the anterior commissure of the vocal folds are attached to the inner aspect of the thyroid cartilage at the thyroid prominence (also called the Adam's apple).</p><p>The arytenoids, which help to position and move the vocal folds, articulate on the posterior edges of the cricoid cartilage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56206 \">figure 2</a>). The aryepiglottic folds are formed by mucosa that runs from each edge of the epiglottis to the arytenoid. The lower portion of the aryepiglottic fold creates the false vocal folds (also called the false vocal cords or vestibular folds), which are protective in normal phonation function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79855 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The true vocal folds (the vocal cords) are comprised of the thyroarytenoid muscle and the vocal ligament and extend from the vocal process of the arytenoid to the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage anteriorly. The vocal folds undergo age-related changes, lengthening as the child grows.</p><p>The muscles of the larynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56206 \">figure 2</a>) act to open and close the glottis and to regulate voice quality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62687\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62687 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The superior and recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve innervate the laryngopharynx. The recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) branch from the vagus in the upper chest and re-enter the neck (&quot;recur&quot;) in the thoracic inlet, extending to the larynx superiorly, traveling in or near the tracheoesophageal groove. The right and left RLNs travel underneath the right subclavian artery and around the arch of the aorta, respectively. The superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) descends along the pharynx and divides into internal and external branches.</p><p>The SLN supplies sensory innervation to the epiglottis and false vocal folds and the motor innervation to the cricothyroid muscle. The remainder of the larynx receives motor and sensory innervation from the RLN. The interarytenoid muscle is the only muscle that is dually innervated by both RLN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The larynx has three main functions: phonation, airway protection, and cough production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Phonation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phonation occurs as a result of the interaction between the true vocal cords and the exhaled column of air from the lungs, which creates oscillation of the vocal fold mucosa relative to the deeper vocal fold structures (thyroarytenoid muscle and vocal ligament).</p><p>The intrinsic laryngeal musculature adjusts the tension and location of the vocal folds to produce fine changes in voice production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62687\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62687 \">table 2</a>). Changes in pitch and frequency are mediated by the tension and position of the vocal folds, which are controlled by the cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscles. Contraction of the thyroarytenoid shortens and contraction of the cricothyroid muscle lengthens the vocal fold, resulting in lower and higher pitch, respectively.</p><p>Voice is articulated through fine motor control of the tongue and lips, and resonated by the airway above the vocal folds. The size of the pharynx, oral cavity, nasal cavity, and larynx increase with age, resulting in changes of resonance, particularly in boys. The loudness of voice is directly related to subglottic pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The airway is protected from ingested material during swallowing by laryngeal elevation, epiglottic deflection, and closure of the false and true vocal folds. Contraction of the paired lateral cricoarytenoid and the interarytenoid muscles results in adduction of the vocal folds and closure of the airway. Contraction of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle causes rotation of the arytenoid and opening of the airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient glottic closure causes increased intrathoracic pressure that results in cough. Rapid glottic opening during cough facilitates the expectoration of tracheal air and mucous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the child with hoarseness begins with a complete history and physical examination. Additional information can be obtained from laryngoscopy, radiographic studies, and voice evaluation. Children who have rapidly progressive symptoms, stridor, aspiration, pain, or respiratory distress may require urgent otolaryngology evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Specialist evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history is instrumental in making a diagnosis. The first step is to determine in what way the child's voice has changed. Descriptions from the child, parent, or teacher are helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Voice complaint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following questions may help to determine the cause and type of voice complaint:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a problem with the vocal quality?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the child complain of breathiness?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the voice rough or strained?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the voice resonance have a hypernasal or hyponasal quality?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the voice pitch too high or too low? Does it change or break?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the child's voice too loud or too soft?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the child's voice ever normal?</p><p/><p>The responses to these questions can help to pinpoint the location of the voice problem. Breathiness of the voice, due to leakage of air through the vocal cords, may indicate vocal fold paralysis or a lesion preventing complete closure of the glottis. A change in resonance may indicate a mass lesion, nasal obstruction, or incomplete palatal closure. A change in pitch or quality of the voice may indicate a mucosal irregularity of the vocal fold. Difficulty with loudness may indicate a pulmonary or effort-related problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Once the exact nature of the voice change has been determined, other factors relating to the dysphonia must be elicited, particularly the onset and tempo of the problem:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the onset related to a particular event?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the onset gradual, or has the dysphonia been longstanding?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the symptoms intermittent or chronic?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the voice complaint been progressive or static?</p><p/><p>Acute problems are more commonly related to vocal abuse and result from injury to the mucosa overlying the vocal folds. Acute problems may also be caused by an infectious or inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Chronic, progressive problems typically indicate a structural abnormality.</p><p>The pediatric voice handicap index is a subjective tool to evaluate pediatric dysphonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Otoscopic examination, including pneumatic otoscopy, should be performed to rule out middle ear pathology (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing impairment in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>). Other pertinent components of the physical examination include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the skin for any cutaneous lesions, hemangiomas, or lymphatic malformations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the nose for patency, obstructing lesions, foreign body, or evidence of allergy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the oral cavity for mass lesions, mucosal abnormalities, tonsil size, and motor function of the palate and tongue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of the neck for mass lesions</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiologic evaluation of children with hoarseness is not usually necessary. This is because most causes of childhood hoarseness involve the mucosal surface of the vocal folds or a functional problem of the larynx (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common causes of hoarseness in children&quot;</a>). However, radiologic evaluation can be helpful in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is useful when a mass lesion is suspected either within the larynx or along the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in the event of a vocal fold paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest radiograph or fluoroscopic evaluation may be helpful in evaluating the presence of a foreign body.

Children who have hoarseness and rapidly progressive symptoms, stridor, aspiration, pain, or respiratory distress may require urgent otolaryngology evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common causes of hoarseness in children&quot;</a>). The indications for referral in children with nonacute hoarseness include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration greater than two weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained hoarseness (eg, not associated with an upper respiratory tract infection)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive hoarseness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Socially unacceptable hoarseness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complete evaluation of a child who has hoarseness and any of the above indications includes visualization of the larynx by indirect or flexible laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy is a valuable tool in the examination of the larynx in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After adequate anesthesia of the nasal cavity, the flexible scope is used to examine the nasopharynx and larynx, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The closure of the palate and adenoid pad in the nasopharynx</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prominence and architecture of the base of the tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of pooling or mass lesions in the pyriform sinuses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The architecture and function of the larynx</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of mass lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vocal folds for symmetry or lesions of the free edge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patency of the airway and completeness of airway closure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of reflux</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal mobility during speech and swallowing</p><p/><p>The older child is asked to perform a variety of tasks under direct visualization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voicing the letter &quot;i&quot; permits visualization of the adductory movement of the vocal fold.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep inspiration or a &quot;sniff&quot; permits visualization of the abductory movements.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pronouncing &quot;i&quot; with a low pitch upscale to a high pitch permits testing of the cricothyroid muscle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluency of speech is determined by repeating phrases and connected speech. This demonstrates normal neurologic control of vocal fold movement.</p><p/><p>The stroboscopic examination is another useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of hoarseness. During phonation, the vocal folds vibrate more than 100 times per second. The stroboscope sends out bright flashes of light that are timed to the frequency of vocal fold vibration, a process that visually &quot;freezes&quot; the image for the observer and permits evaluation of the mucosal edges of the vocal folds for irregularity or subtle changes. The endoscopes used for stroboscopy are usually a rigid telescope with a 90&deg; prism (which allows visualization of the larynx through the oral cavity) and the flexible endoscope. Stroboscopic examination is usually well tolerated in children older than six to seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-children-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Direct laryngoscopy may be necessary if the larynx is not adequately visualized by nasopharyngolaryngoscopy or stroboscopic examination, if the child's hoarseness is not responding to therapy, or if a suspicious lesion is detected with the above examinations. Direct laryngoscopy is performed in the operating room. The laryngoscope is placed within the oral cavity to directly visualize the larynx. A microscope or telescope can be used to enhance visualization. Complications of direct laryngoscopy are rare and may include dislocation of the jaw, inadvertent removal of teeth, discomfort, small mucosal tears, injury to the larynx, and the risk of anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech and language</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of a speech language pathologist (SLP) is crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of a child with hoarseness. The SLP performs an acoustic assessment including pitch, loudness, voice quality, and phonation time. Glottic airflow, subglottic air pressure, and glottic resistance are evaluated during aerodynamic assessment. Hearing evaluation is performed when indicated.
