Because many patients are treated as outpatients in an office setting, reliable statistics are difficult to obtain. Nonetheless, the National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately two million new cases occurred in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-advanced-cutaneous-squamous-and-basal-cell-carcinomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of patients can be successfully managed with a variety of simple procedures, such as cryotherapy, curettage and electrodesiccation, topical treatments (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>), or simple surgical excision. When lesions are more advanced, Mohs micrographic surgery, more extensive surgical resection, or radiation therapy are generally sufficient to control locoregional disease.</p><p>Despite their high prevalence, these NMSCs are rarely fatal. It is estimated that in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-advanced-cutaneous-squamous-and-basal-cell-carcinomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], approximately 1000 patients died of the disease. Squamous cell carcinomas are biologically more aggressive, and neglected lesions can be life-threatening due to local extension or metastasis. By contrast, basal cell carcinoma is only very rarely life-threatening.</p><p>The use of systemic therapy is limited to patients with distant metastases or locally advanced disease that cannot be adequately managed with surgical or radiotherapeutic techniques.</p><p>Systemic chemotherapy for basal cell and squamous cancers of the skin is discussed here. The treatment of localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas is discussed elsewhere.

A possible link between treatment with vismodegib and squamous cell carcinoma was suggested by a case control study that included 55 patients treated with vismodegib and 125 controls, in which there was an approximately eightfold increase in new cases of squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-advanced-cutaneous-squamous-and-basal-cell-carcinomas/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].
