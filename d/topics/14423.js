All patient or family meetings should discuss prognosis associated with the etiology of the acute illness in the context of life expectancy from the underlying malignancy. Clinicians should recognize that a dying patient may be ill-served by prolonged, non-palliative life support in an ICU. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-in-the-icu-holding-a-family-meeting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication in the ICU: Holding a family meeting&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although palliative care has not been shown to impact mortality of the critically ill adult patient in the ICU, it has been shown to improve survival and quality of life in ambulatory adult patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-cancer-patients-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Palliation and end-of life decisions are a common occurrence in the ICU for patients with malignancy and recipients of HCT. Prognosis should be reassessed at frequent intervals with particular attention to the development of multiple organ dysfunction. For those in whom the prognosis is predicted to be poor during their ICU admission (eg, HCT recipients with multiorgan failure), early discussion of the likely outcome with caregivers and family is essential, often prompting withdrawal of care. In addition, studies in this population consistently describe a continued decline in life expectancy once patients are discharged from the ICU. When appropriate, patients or family members should be advised that an incurable malignancy may progress throughout the duration of a critical illness such that at the point of discharge from the ICU death from their underlying cancer might be expected. For those in whom survival is predicted to be poor following discharge, early palliative and end-of-life discussions may elicit the desire to avoid re-admission and or redirect care to palliation in the event that another acute life-threatening illness arises. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withholding-and-withdrawing-ventilatory-support-in-adults-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-in-the-icu-holding-a-family-meeting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication in the ICU: Holding a family meeting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Palliative care services are probably underutilized in the ICU and yet often prompt advance directives.
