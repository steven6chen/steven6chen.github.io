Most patients with a metabolic myopathy (eg, glycogen storage diseases, carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency) have dynamic rather than static symptoms, and therefore usually complain of exercise intolerance or muscle pain and cramps with exercise. Nevertheless, other patients may develop progressive muscular weakness that is usually proximal (mimicking inflammatory myopathy or limb girdle muscular dystrophy), but is sometimes distal. In a smaller group of patients, both dynamic and static symptoms predominate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59733 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders of glycogen metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited disorders that result in abnormal storage of glycogen are known as glycogen storage diseases. These disorders have largely been categorized by number according to the chronology of recognition of the responsible enzyme defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54417 \">table 2</a>). The age of onset varies from birth to adulthood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inherited-disorders-of-glucose-and-glycogen-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with defects of carbohydrate metabolism, muscle symptoms are induced by either brief isometric exercise, such as lifting heavy weights, or by less intense but sustained dynamic exercise, such as swimming, climbing stairs, or running. Acute muscle breakdown may lead to myoglobinuria, cramps, and muscle swelling.</p><p>In young children, defects in glycogenolysis may present with liver dysfunction, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia (sometimes with associated hypoglycemic seizures), gross motor delay, peripheral neuropathy, cardiac involvement, hemolytic anemia with jaundice, splenomegaly, and myoglobinuria. Mental retardation, upper and lower motor neuron involvement with sensory loss, sphincter problems, and neurogenic bladder may also be observed.</p><p>The principal symptoms and signs, however, are those related to exercise intolerance and recurrent myoglobinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients with defects of glycogen metabolism usually complain of easy fatigability upon exertion and, occasionally, of muscle stiffness induced by exercise. In some cases, brief rest when muscle symptoms develop can subsequently result in improved exercise tolerance, referred to as the spontaneous &quot;second wind&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This occurs because of increased blood glucose levels related to mobilization of hepatic glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &quot;Second wind&quot; also can be induced by the infusion of carbohydrate fuel (eg, glucose) or lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Patients with certain glycolytic defects (eg, muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency), however, are unable to achieve a spontaneous second wind [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or have worsening of symptoms after the administration of glucose (the &quot;out of wind&quot; phenomenon&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] due to decreased availability of free fatty acids and ketones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

These patients, in contrast to those with glycogen metabolism defects, do not develop true muscle cramps or contractures, and do not experience a &quot;second wind.&quot;</p><p>There are four main clinical and laboratory features that should lead the clinician to suspect a fatty acid oxidation disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of tissues dependent on fatty acid oxidation, such as the heart, muscle, and liver</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia (ketoacidosis does not occur because fatty acids cannot be converted to ketoacids in the liver)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute metabolic decompensation in association with fasting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in plasma and tissue concentrations of carnitine</p><p/><p>Other conditions that can lead to metabolic decompensation among patients with fatty acid oxidation defects include cold-induced shivering thermogenesis and infection with vomiting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With cold exposure, shivering depends heavily upon long-chain fatty acid oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After prolonged fasting or during infections, children can become comatose and present with symptoms similar to Reye syndrome</p><p/><p>Skeletal muscle, heart, and liver are highly dependent upon efficient fatty acid utilization. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and liver, particularly during fasting when glycogen and glucose stores have been depleted. In addition, resting muscle and exercising muscle during mild to moderate prolonged exercise derive most of the required energy from fatty acid oxidation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=energy-metabolism-in-muscle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Energy metabolism in muscle&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among fasting patients with fatty acid oxidation defects, the free fatty acids cannot be metabolized because of the existing metabolic block; as a result, they are stored in the cytoplasm as triglycerides, thereby resulting in progressive lipid storage myopathy with weakness, hypertrophic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dilated cardiomyopathy, and fatty liver. In addition, with fasting, glucose and glycogen stores are depleted and ketone bodies are not generated because of the existing metabolic block. As a result, the ratio of serum free fatty acids to ketones increases from the normal ratio of 1:1 to more than 2:1, which is highly suggestive of a block in beta-oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Serum carnitine levels vary with the different defects of lipid metabolism. With carnitine transport defects, for example, total serum carnitine is significantly reduced (eg, &lt;5 percent of normal) and the esterified fraction is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This finding is probably related to both reduced renal carnitine reabsorption, leading to carnitine leak, and defective intestinal carnitine absorption.</p><p>By comparison, in the majority of cases of intramitochondrial beta-oxidation defects, the amount of total serum carnitine is reduced to &lt;50 percent of normal, and the esterified carnitine fraction is increased to &gt;50 percent of normal (normal: 10 to 25 percent in the fed state and 30 to 50 percent during fasting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This occurs because the accumulating longer-chain-length acylcarnitines are reabsorbed much more easily at the renal tubular reabsorptive site than free carnitine. As a result, the free carnitine fraction will be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In contrast to those with glycogen metabolism defects, patients with isolated mitochondrial myopathy do not develop true muscle cramps or a &quot;second wind.&quot; Resting venous lactic acidosis is common in such patients, who are sometimes misdiagnosed as having chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Myoglobin is a monomer that is not significantly protein-bound and is therefore rapidly excreted in the urine, often resulting in the production of red to brown urine. It appears in the urine when the plasma concentration exceeds 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Visible changes in the urine only occur once urine levels exceed about 100 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> although it can be detected by the urine (orthotolidine) dipstick at concentrations of only 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Myoglobin has a half-life of only two to three hours, much shorter than that of CK. Because of its rapid excretion and metabolism to bilirubin, serum levels may return to normal within six to eight hours.

Most patients with a metabolic myopathy have dynamic rather than static symptoms, and therefore usually complain of exercise intolerance or muscle pain and cramps. Nevertheless, other patients may develop progressive muscular weakness that is usually proximal (mimicking inflammatory myopathy or limb girdle muscular dystrophy), but is sometimes distal. In a smaller group of patients, both dynamic and static symptoms predominate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59733 \">table 1</a>).

The free fatty acids cannot be metabolized because of the existing metabolic block; as a result, they are stored in the cytoplasm as triglycerides, thereby resulting in progressive lipid storage myopathy with weakness, hypertrophic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dilated cardiomyopathy, and fatty liver. Symptoms are usually induced by prolonged exercise and prolonged fasting. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Disorders of lipid metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise intolerance due to premature fatigue is a common manifestation of mitochondrial diseases, and the exercise intolerance is usually more severe than muscle weakness. In contrast to those with glycogen metabolism defects, patients with isolated mitochondrial myopathy do not develop true muscle cramps or a &quot;second wind.&quot; Resting venous lactic acidosis is common in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H400795808\" class=\"local\">'Mitochondrial disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with metabolic myopathies, such as those with inherited disorders of glycogenolysis, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, or purine metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61324 \">table 3</a>), are at increased risk for developing myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis. The metabolic myopathies represent a small percentage of all cases of rhabdomyolysis but are relatively common causes among patients with recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis after exertion. The most common metabolic cause of recurrent myoglobinuria in both adults and children is carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency.

Other, more common etiologies of myopathy (eg, toxic, traumatic, alcohol- and drug-related, endocrine, viral, and inflammatory) should be excluded by appropriate testing prior to investigating a metabolic etiology. The evaluation needed to confirm the diagnosis of a metabolic myopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71018\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71018 \">algorithm 1</a>) is guided by a constellation of findings including the clinical presentation, the type of muscle involvement, specific laboratory abnormalities (particularly elevations in serum creatine kinase and myoglobinuria), patient age, family history, the results of histologic and pathologic examinations, and, increasingly, genetic testing.
