It is one of the most localizing brainstem syndromes, resulting from a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) in the dorsomedial brainstem tegmentum of either the pons or the midbrain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OCULOMOTOR CIRCUITRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foveation or visual targeting with binocular fusion and stereoscopy (depth perception) requires highly synchronous eye movements that place objects of visual interest on the corresponding points of both retinas. This process is dependent upon the precise coordination between cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, and their interneuronal pathways that project through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62010 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) is often referred to as the conjugate gaze center for horizontal eye movements. During horizontal eye movement, the PPRF burst cells innervate the abducens nucleus, which contains two distinctive sets of neurons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axons of the abducens motor neurons directly innervate the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axons of the abducens interneurons cross the midline to become the MLF and subsequently innervate the medial rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor complex (cranial nerve nucleus III). Motor neurons from this subnucleus innervate the medial rectus muscle (ipsilateral to the medial rectus subnucleus and contralateral to the abducens nucleus). </p><p/><p>The MLF exists as a pair of white matter fiber tracts that lie near the midline just under (or ventral to) the fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct and extend through the dorsomedial pontine and midbrain tegmentum. Because of their close physical proximity near the midline, bilateral injury is common. While the MLF is primarily involved in coordinating synchronous horizontal eye movements, it also contains pathways involved in the regulation of vertical pursuit, vertical vestibular signals, and vertical alignment of the two eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. </p><p>An INO results from injury to the MLF within the dorsomedial pontine or midbrain tegmentum. The side of the INO is named by the side of the adduction deficit, which is ipsilateral to the MLF lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25489472\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with INO may complain of horizontal diplopia when there is a significant adduction weakness or limitation on lateral gaze [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Diplopia is not usually present in primary gaze. However, some patients complain of vertical diplopia in the primary position due to skew deviation of eyes.</p><p>The dysconjugate movement of the two eyes during horizontal gaze results in an interruption in binocular fusion that can lead to visual confusion, oscillopsia, diplopia, reading fatigue, and loss of stereopsis (depth perception) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some patients also complain of vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Visual symptoms may be particularly problematic with head turning, especially while walking or driving, and can increase the risk of falls and motor vehicle accidents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1358858267\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important findings on examination include impaired adduction on lateral gaze, with nystagmus in the contralateral, abducting eye. Other signs may also be observed. Many patients, particularly those with demyelinating disease, will have bilateral involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Adduction weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the severity of the lesion, adduction of the involved eye may be impaired or absent. If the defect is severe (as in severe demyelination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with axonal transection), then the observer may identify partial or even complete absence of adduction.</p><p>In milder forms, the deficit may be limited to a decrease in adduction velocity without ocular limitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53437 \">figure 2</a>). Evidence of milder forms of INO may be best elicited by asking the patient to perform fast horizontal eye movements (saccades) away from a fixed central point, or by observing the adducting eye during its return to a central point of fixation from an eccentric point of gaze holding. Perhaps the most sensitive method to demonstrate a subtle adduction lag is to observe the fast phase (saccade) of optokinetic (OKN) nystagmus, while using an alternately striped fabric strip.</p><p>Interruption of the ascending axons that arise from the internuclear neurons in the abducens nucleus likely explains the observed adduction deficit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal convergence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) are located in the pons or caudal mesencephalon, sparing the vergence pathways, including the fibers deriving from the medial rectus subnucleus of cranial nerve III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. As a result, convergence is intact in the majority of patients despite adduction weakness on lateral gaze. Intact convergence can help distinguish an INO from a partial third nerve palsy; however, impaired convergence does not rule out an INO. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Abduction nystagmus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contralateral abducting eye will usually exhibit a disassociated horizontal nystagmus, although this does not always occur.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms causing abducting nystagmus are unknown. There is evidence that more than one mechanism may play a role in different patients and even in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One theory with empiric support is that abduction nystagmus results from an adaptive response to overcome the weakness of the contralateral medial rectus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This is explained by Hering law of equal innervation, which states that attempts to increase innervation to the weak (medial rectus) muscle in one eye are accompanied by a commensurate increase in innervation to the yoke (lateral rectus) muscle in the other eye. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, gaze-evoked nystagmus may occur in patients with INO because of involvement of adjacent structures, such as the vestibular nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The nystagmus is dissociated because adductor weakness limits its manifestation in the affected eye. Subclinical nystagmus in the adducting eye has been demonstrated with electro-ocular techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Abduction slowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients, INO can produce slowing of abduction as well as adduction in the affected eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. This small degree of abduction slowing is expected in the context of adduction weakness, because of the loss of the contribution of the off-pulse of innervation (defective relaxation) when the medial rectus acts as an antagonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Abnormal vertical eye movements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with INO often exhibit abnormalities with vertical eye movements, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertical gaze-evoked nystagmus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skew deviation with the elevation of the weak adducting eye. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pontine lesions produce hyperdeviation (elevation) of the ipsilateral eye, often in conjunction with a homolateral INO. For example, a right dorsomedial pontine tegmentum lesion can produce a right eye hyperdeviation due to skew deviation, as well as a right INO, with slow adduction of the right eye during attempted leftward saccades. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraversive ocular tilt reaction &ndash; In the ocular tilt reaction, the head tilts away from the side of the higher eye, the upper pole of the higher eye is intorted toward the nose, and the upper pole of the lower eye is extorted away from the nose. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished vertical gaze holding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal OKN and pursuit responses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppressed vestibular ocular reflex (VOR).</p><p/><p>These supplementary signs are inconsistently present, more often with bilateral than unilateral INO, and are not required for the diagnosis of INO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Rather, they might be more accurately designated as so-called INO+ syndromes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated syndromes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">One-and-a-half syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This syndrome consists of a gaze palsy in one direction with an INO on horizontal gaze in the opposite direction. With attempted horizontal gaze, only abduction of the contralateral eye remains. Convergence is spared. In primary (neutral gaze), the contralateral eye is slightly abducted (so-called paralytic pontine exotropia). This syndrome is produced by damage to the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abducens nucleus and MLF on the same side. If the abducens nucleus is spared, the gaze palsy is apparent on volitional horizontal gaze, but is normal with oculocephalic maneuvers, as volitional eye movement requires activation of the PPRF, but the VOR does not.</p><p>As an example, a left paramedian pontine tegmentum lesion affecting the PPRF, abducens nucleus, and MLF produces a left gaze paresis as well as a left INO on attempted right gaze. During primary (forward) gaze, the right eye is slightly abducted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Wall-eyed bilateral INO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the lesion affects the MLF within the upper midbrain, vergence pathways and the oculomotor apparatus can be disrupted, resulting in a variety of eye movement abnormalities that include impaired convergence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/13,14,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,16,19</a>]. These lesions are typically bilateral and produce divergence of the eyes (wall-eyed), along with bilateral INO, the WEBINO syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1408029971\"><span class=\"h3\">Eight-and-a-half syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This syndrome consists of the one-and-a-half syndrome plus lower motor neuron pattern facial weakness on the side ipsilateral to the INO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. This occurs when there is involvement of the fascicle of the ipsilateral facial nerve (CN VII) at the level of the facial colliculus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many potential causes of INO (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78378\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78378 \">table 1</a>). Most cases (approximately 70 percent) of INO are due to multiple sclerosis (MS) or cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple sclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MS underlies approximately one-third of cases of INO and is the most common cause in a young person (&lt;45 years). The deficit is bilateral in most (73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>INO is also the most common eye movement abnormality in MS. The reported prevalence of INO among patients with MS varies between 17 and 41 percent of patients, depending in part on whether the INO is a clinical manifestation or an incidental finding on examination, as well as on the techniques used to elicit this finding (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The periventricular location of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is thought to make this area particularly susceptible to autoimmune inflammatory demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Clinical signs in MS may be exacerbated by small increases in body temperature (as with exposure to high ambient temperature, fever, during exercise; also known as Uhthoff phenomenon) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H392245186\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Heat sensitivity'</a>). This has been modeled in our laboratory in MS patients with INO, using infrared eye movement recording techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of INO in an older patient is ischemic infarction. These patients are typically older than patients with MS, with an average age of 62 to 66 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/3,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,34</a>]. In addition to advanced age, vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking) are prevalent in these patients. In contrast to MS, most (87 to 93 percent) INO in this setting is unilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>].</p><p>The underlying stroke subtype is usually small artery occlusion or lacunar disease involving the penetrating arteries originating from the basilar artery. Large branch artery occlusions in the basilar, superior cerebellar, and posterior cerebral arteries have also been associated with infarctions producing INO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In large case series, individual cases of INO are reported with many other stroke subtypes, including hemorrhage (hypertensive, vascular malformation), vertebral artery dissection, temporal arteritis, and other vasculitides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>More than half of patients with an INO due to brainstem infarction have other neurologic symptoms and signs in addition to INO, including sensory deficits, dysarthria, gait ataxia, and lower motor neuron facial palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of causes make up the one-quarter to one-third of INO cases that are not due to MS or cerebrovascular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78378\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78378 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/6,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27</a>]. The most common of these are infection, trauma, and tumor. In some remarkable cases, mild head injury can produce an isolated unilateral or bilateral INO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A partial third nerve palsy with prominent medial rectus weakness may be confused with an INO. Distinguishing features include other third nerve deficits (weakness of elevation, ptosis, pupil dilation), impaired convergence, and absence of the contralateral abduction nystagmus, all of which point to a third nerve palsy rather than an INO. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are reports of eye movement abnormalities in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) that suggest bilateral INO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Parkinsonism and other features of PSP are present in these individuals, and the eye movement abnormality can be overcome with oculocephalic maneuvers in PSP (because the lesion is supranuclear) but not in an INO. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A pseudo-internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a well-described phenomenon in patients with myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/18,27,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27,39-41</a>]. In practice, this is most often observed in the setting of an established diagnosis of these disorders, but can be observed at first presentation. The presence of ptosis and lid fatigue will alert the clinician to myasthenia, while areflexia, often with ataxia or limb weakness, will suggest the Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Findings suggestive of bilateral INO have also been reported in the setting of drug overdose; however, these individuals universally have an impaired level of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/27,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of an INO is made by the combined presence of impaired horizontal eye movements with weak adduction of the affected eye, and abduction nystagmus of the contralateral eye. </p><p>Subtle forms of INO can be overlooked on examination and may only be evident on formal oculographic recording, which measures the velocity and acceleration of abduction and adduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/15,18,28,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,28,43</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Oculomotor circuitry'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than two-thirds of cases result from multiple sclerosis (MS) or cerebrovascular disease. Patients with MS are typically young (less than 45 years), and the INO is usually bilateral. Patients with cerebrovascular disease are rarely less than 45 years old, have prevalent vascular risk factors, and are more likely to have a unilateral INO. Infections, tumors, and trauma cause most other cases. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An INO can be confused with a partial third nerve palsy, other supranuclear gaze disturbances, or peripheral neuromuscular disease, especially ocular myasthenia gravis. However, a careful neurologic examination can usually distinguish between these entities. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients who present with INO require brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Contrast enhancement and other specialized MRI sequences can increase the sensitivity of MRI for specific diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H25489693\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients will recover within a few to several months. However, some will have deficits that persist. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330114912\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors would like to acknowledge Ethan Meltzer, MD, who contributed to a revision of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/internuclear-ophthalmoparesis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Frohman EM, Zhang H, Kramer PD, et al.
