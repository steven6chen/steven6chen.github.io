Most clinical manifestations of the Brugada syndrome are related to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, most often ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Patients may also present with syncope, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, nocturnal agonal respiration, or sudden unexpected nocturnal death. (See <a href=\"#H3109137649\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons with Brugada pattern findings on a surface ECG have some form of a pseudo-right bundle branch block and persistent ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V2. In some patients, the characteristic ECG changes of the Brugada pattern are transient or variable over time. (See <a href=\"#H2769795303\" class=\"local\">'ECG findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern, the elevated ST segment (&ge;2 mm) descends with an upward convexity to an inverted T wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91152 \">figure 1</a>). This is referred to as the &quot;coved type&quot; Brugada pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the type 2 Brugada ECG pattern (combined from the original designation of types 2 and 3 patterns), the ST segment has a &quot;saddle back&quot; ST-T wave configuration, in which the elevated ST segment descends toward the baseline, then rises again to an upright or biphasic T wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91152 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic Brugada pattern ECG abnormalities may be exposed by a variety of medications and toxin, thereby identifying those at risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73611 \">table 3</a>), as well as by fever. (See <a href=\"#H4245045919\" class=\"local\">'Provoking factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is most commonly made following a clinically significant event (ie, syncope, sudden cardiac death) in which the patient has the typical Brugada pattern ECG findings. However, some patients may be diagnosed based on the presence of ECG findings and relevant family history of sudden cardiac death or Brugada ECG patterns. Because of the clinical variability in presentation and the different ECG manifestations which can be seen in the Brugada syndrome, diagnostic criteria have been proposed by professional societies from both Europe and North America. (See <a href=\"#H2795396852\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is suspected based on the clinical presentation and ECG findings, additional evaluation may be required to confirm the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome and to provide an estimate of risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in the individual patient. Our approach to the evaluation and risk stratification of patients with Brugada pattern ECG finding depends in large part on the presence or absence of symptoms (see <a href=\"#H2579172063\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and risk stratification'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients with suspected <strong>Brugada syndrome</strong>, based on the combination of symptoms and typical Brugada pattern ECG changes (either type 1 or type 2), require an evaluation to exclude underlying structural heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108988\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108988 \">algorithm 1</a>). This evaluation should include cardiac imaging (with echocardiography and, in selected cases, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) and cardiac stress testing. Drug challenge may be necessary if the other evaluation has not confirmed the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with only a <strong>Brugada pattern</strong> ECG who are entirely asymptomatic do not meet the criteria for Brugada syndrome based on ECG findings alone. A comprehensive family history, cardiac imaging with echocardiography (and, in selected cases, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) should be performed in these patients, with drug challenge, signal-averaged ECG, and invasive electrophysiology studies as potential additional tests of an asymptomatic patient with a Brugada pattern ECG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest genetic testing for all patients with documented <strong>Brugada syndrome</strong> (&quot;probands&quot;). If the proband has an identified genetic mutation (ie, genotype positive), we pursue genetic testing in all of the proband's first degree relatives. We do not recommend genetic testing for <strong>Brugada pattern </strong>ECG probands or their first degree relatives.
