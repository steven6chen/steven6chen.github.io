While it is usually alarming to patients, the cause is almost always benign. Only a few case series have been published, nearly all of which are from urology specialty practices.</p><p>Because of the paucity of research literature, there is little evidence on which clinicians can base their evaluation of patients with hematospermia. Searching for the rare causes that have been identified in case reports is not likely to be productive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and the relative frequencies of causes reported in case series from urology specialty practices may not apply to primary care practice. The most important lesson from the literature is that hematospermia is almost never a sign of cancer in younger patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of hematospermia is prostate biopsy. Hematospermia occurs in more than 80 percent of men undergoing prostate biopsy and lasts for an average of three to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Hematospermia is also common after radiation treatment for prostate cancer, both external beam radiation and brachytherapy. In addition, vasectomy can cause hematospermia for a week or more. Because the cause of hematospermia is obvious in these instances, the remainder of this review will focus on other causes of hematospermia.</p><p>A variety of conditions other than prostate biopsy have been reported in patients with hematospermia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64639 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/4-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-43</a>]. They include benign and malignant disorders of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, spermatic cord, and ejaculatory duct system; urogenital infections including sexually transmitted infections (eg, chlamydia, herpes simplex virus, gonorrhea, trichomonas); metastatic cancers; vascular malformations; congenital and drug-induced bleeding disorders; and even frequent daily ejaculation over a period of several weeks. However, it is often impossible to know with certainty whether these conditions are the cause of hematospermia. The cause is idiopathic in a substantial proportion of patients, and the condition frequently resolves spontaneously.</p><p>It is also difficult to know the true relative frequency of the causes of hematospermia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64639 \">table 1</a>) because of publication bias that tends to favor reporting of new or unusual causes of hematospermia. In addition, as noted previously, there are no data on the relative prevalence of the causes of hematospermia among patients seen in primary care practice.</p><p>The best available information on the relative frequency of the many causes of hematospermia is found in case series from urological specialty practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. They suggest that hematospermia is almost always the result of a benign condition and usually resolves spontaneously. Cancers are rare and occur almost exclusively among patients over age 40 years; serious causes are virtually never found among patients under age 30 years.</p><p>These principles were illustrated in the two largest case series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest case series with long-term follow-up involved 200 men with hematospermia, 150 of whom were followed for 5 to 23 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. They had experienced hematospermia for a mean of 3.4 months (range: one day to eight years). All patients underwent transrectal ultrasound and a variety of minor abnormalities were found in the seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, and prostate. No cancers were found in patients less than 40 years old. Eight of 126 patients (6.3 percent) over 40 had cancer (five prostate, two seminal vesicle, one bladder).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest case series with the longest follow-up involved 200 men with hematospermia, 150 of whom were followed for 5 to 23 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The men ranged from age 20 to 74; most were between ages 40 and 70. Approximately 85 percent of men had multiple episodes of hematospermia. Most underwent a urological workup that was standard at the time, including digital rectal examination (DRE), cystoscopy, and kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) radiographs. These studies were negative in 63 percent. In the remainder, a variety of minor abnormalities were detected, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (17 percent), prostatic calculi (7 percent), and abnormal veins (8 percent). It was not certain whether any of these abnormalities caused the bleeding or if they were simply coincidental problems. Cancer was an uncommon diagnosis; during long-term follow-up, prostate cancer developed in only 4 percent and bladder cancer in one man. It is possible that these few cases of cancer were related to the initial complaint of hematospermia, but they may also have been incidental cases related to the expected rate of such cancers among men as they age.</p><p/><p>No cancers were found in men in other smaller case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. In two of these series that used transrectal ultrasound for evaluation, abnormalities of the seminal vesicles were common, including dilated seminal vesicles, seminal vesicle cysts, seminal vesicle amyloidosis, and calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Prostatitis was diagnosed in 28 percent of patients in the last report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Hematospermia may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in older men. In a community-based screening study involving 26,126 men ages 50 or older (or ages 40 or older if black or with a family history of prostate cancer), men were screened for prostate cancer every 6 or 12 months with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and DRE and underwent biopsy, if these results were abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. On an initial questionnaire, 187 men (0.7 percent) reported a history of hematospermia. Over the course of the study, prostate cancer was detected more commonly in men with than without hematospermia (13.7 versus 6.5 percent). No cases of prostate cancer were found in the 15 men with hematospermia who were younger than age 50. The interval between hematospermia and prostate cancer, as well as the duration of hematospermia, could not be assessed in this study. Also, it is unclear whether the history of hematospermia could have been known to the examiner performing the DRE and thus could have resulted in more aggressive evaluation for prostate cancer (detection bias); however, the authors of the paper report that they do not believe the examiners had this information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The major conclusions drawn from these and other studies are that hematospermia is almost always caused by a benign condition in younger men and, in many cases, no clear cause can be identified. In older men with hematospermia, genitourinary cancers should be considered in the differential diagnosis, but the rate of such cancers is low, even after long-term follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of hematospermia is almost always a benign condition. For patients who are otherwise asymptomatic, the initial evaluation consists of a history, physical examination, and urinalysis. Other studies are indicated only if abnormalities are suggested by these initial measures or if hematospermia persists. Although many experts recommend a more aggressive evaluation for even a single episode of hematospermia in a man over age 50, we do not believe existing evidence supports the need for this.</p><p>Men with hematospermia and symptoms of urethritis should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Persistent unexplained hematospermia (lasting longer than one month) should be evaluated with transrectal ultrasonography and, in men over age 50, with referral to a urologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history is usually unrevealing unless the patient has an obvious history of dysuria (suggesting infection), urological symptoms suggesting prostate disease, or known urological malignancy. The clinician should ask patients about these conditions, although they are not often present. The patient&rsquo;s medication list should be evaluated for agents that have been associated with hematospermia (eg, antiplatelet drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Questions should also be asked to assure that the patient has not recently had a biopsy of the prostate gland or vasectomy because, as mentioned, hematospermia is a well-known complication of these procedures.</p><p>Travel history should be reviewed to determine if the patient has visited an area that is endemic for schistosomiasis, as there are multiple case reports of hematospermia due to this infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/9,10,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,49-51</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-schistosomiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the physical examination is typically normal among patients with hematospermia, examination should focus on identifying organ enlargement or masses in the scrotum, or nodularity or enlargement of the prostate gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinalysis and urine culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urinalysis should be performed on all patients with hematospermia to exclude infection; bacterial culture should be obtained as indicated by the results of the urinalysis. Pyuria without bacteriuria may be a clue to chlamydial infection, one of the reported (though uncommon) causes of hematospermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/11,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Men with hematospermia and symptoms of urethritis should be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea. If these tests are negative but symptoms of urethritis persist, infection with other agents such as trichomonas should be considered. The diagnosis of trichomonas in men is difficult and may require specimens from multiple sites (eg, urine, urethra, semen). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adults and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In men with hematospermia who are otherwise asymptomatic, we suggest not routinely testing for sexually transmitted infections. In men at very high risk for sexually transmitted infections, routine screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recommended even in the absence of hematospermia and so would be appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Semen examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the semen is not a routine part of the evaluation of patients with hematospermia. There are, however, several situations in which semen examination can be helpful.</p><p>The first is when there is doubt about whether the patient actually has hematospermia. In this situation, the patient can ejaculate into a condom and the ejaculate can be examined for the presence of blood.</p><p>A second situation in which semen evaluation may be helpful is when the patient has a history of travel to an area in which schistosomiasis is endemic. In these cases, microscopic examination of the semen can detect <em>Schistosoma haematobium</em> or <em>S. mansoni</em>. Semen microscopy is not a useful test if there is no such travel history.</p><p>At least one case report suggests that melanospermia can be confused with hematospermia. Melanospermia occurs when malignant melanoma, metastatic to the seminal vesicles, causes pigmentation of the semen (although melanoma can also cause true hematospermia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. While this diagnosis is quite rare, melanospermia can be distinguished from hematospermia by subjecting the semen specimen to gas chromatography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is not necessary in men with hematospermia. Some studies do suggest that men over age 50 with a history of hematospermia are at a slightly higher long-term risk of prostate cancer, so it is reasonable to take this into account when making decisions about screening for prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When imaging is required, transrectal ultrasound is the imaging procedure of choice for patients with hematospermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/6,7,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,54,55</a>]. It can identify structural abnormalities of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and spermatic cord, and guide biopsies if any suspicious abnormalities are identified in those organs. Transrectal ultrasound should be obtained when hematospermia persists for more than one month.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly endorectal coil MRI, is a second-line imaging test that may occasionally be helpful when transrectal ultrasound is technically inadequate or nondiagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/12,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,56</a>]. However, some studies suggest that MRI for the evaluation of hematospermia leads to a higher rate of prostate biopsies with no change in the cancer detection rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the results of the tests discussed above, other studies may be occasionally indicated in selected cases. These include cystoscopy, contrast studies (eg, vasography), or biopsies of the prostate, testes, or other organs. We suggest referring men over age 50 with hematospermia lasting more than one month to a urologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the evaluation described above will not identify a clear cause of hematospermia. Thus, there is no specific treatment for the majority of patients, and the condition usually resolves spontaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with identified abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific treatable conditions that are identified during the evaluation, such as infection or tumor, should be treated according to current practice standards. Some structural abnormalities of the urogenital tract, such as m&uuml;llerian duct cysts and ejaculatory duct obstruction, may be treatable endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/33,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating for presumptive prostatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned, 15 to 28 percent of patients with hematospermia have prostatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. Some clinicians prescribe an antibiotic for treatment of &quot;presumptive&quot; prostatitis when faced with a patient presenting with a first episode of hematospermia for whom no specific diagnosis is identified. This approach is based on the rationale that prostatitis is relatively common, can cause hematospermia, and is easily treated with antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, there is no evidence that such treatment is effective. Any apparent beneficial effect may simply be due to the fact that hematospermia resolves spontaneously in most patients. Nevertheless, it may be reasonable to consider empiric treatment in patients with persistent hematospermia who have no other apparent cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis#H14689296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Reassurance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific medical or surgical treatment is available for most men with hematospermia. This fact, combined with the low frequency of serious abnormalities, suggests that the most important therapeutic intervention is reassurance. Patients with hematospermia are typically anxious and concerned that their bloody semen is a sign of cancer. In younger men, and after an appropriate evaluation in older men, reassurance can be given, with confidence, that occult cancer is an unlikely diagnosis. Patients can be further encouraged that most cases of hematospermia resolve spontaneously.</p><p>Nevertheless, patients who have persistent hematospermia for more than one month should probably be reevaluated with transrectal ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3027582587\"><span class=\"h2\">Emerging therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single-center reports have described an endoscopic laser approach to persistent hematospermia in the setting of ejaculatory duct obstruction or calculi after cancer has been excluded. This approach involves a holmium laser applied to the ejaculatory duct and seminal vesicles, which are common sources of non-malignant hematospermia. In one small study involving patients who had been experiencing hematospermia for an average of 31 months, hematospermia resolved with this treatment in 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In another small study involving patients with hematospermia for more than four years, all were free of hematospermia on follow-up, and no complications were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematospermia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Endoscopic laser treatment has not been evaluated in randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematospermia is almost always a benign condition.
