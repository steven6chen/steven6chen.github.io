The perioperative considerations in patients with native aortic valve stenosis who are undergoing noncardiac surgery will be reviewed here. The perioperative management of patients with aortic regurgitation, mitral valve disease, and prosthetic heart valves is discussed elsewhere.

The stenotic process is usually gradual in onset and progression, giving the heart ample opportunity to adapt. The LV myocardium hypertrophies over time, resulting in the generation of greater pressure during systole, which forces blood past the fixed mechanical obstruction. As a result, the cardiac output and LV end-diastolic volume are maintained and patients can remain asymptomatic for a prolonged period of time, even with severe AS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-epidemiology-and-prognosis-of-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history, epidemiology, and prognosis of aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the chronic pressure overload state that results in the compensatory concentric LV hypertrophy also reduces the compliance of the left ventricle. As a result, diastolic dysfunction develops over time, the end diastolic pressure of the LV increases, and patients eventually develop symptoms of chest pain or dyspnea. The concentric hypertrophy also reduces coronary flow reserve, rendering the patient more susceptible to ischemia in situations of increased myocardial oxygen demand, even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, due to fixed obstruction of the LV outflow tract, decreases in systemic vascular resistance can result in relative systemic hypotension and subsequent ischemia from reduced coronary perfusion. An additional potential cause of hypotension in patients with AS is elevated LV pressures causing mechanoreceptor stimulation and reflex bradycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic vasodilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therefore, clinical deterioration can occur in patients with asymptomatic AS during the hemodynamic stress associated with noncardiac surgery (as well as other states that require augmentation of cardiac output such as infection, anemia, or pregnancy).

A functional murmur should be distinguished from a pathologic murmur with a careful history and physical examination that includes cardiac maneuvers. The findings should be correlated clinically with symptoms.

Those with stage A AS are considered at risk for progression (eg, those with bicuspid aortic valve); stage B, mild to moderate severity disease, but asymptomatic; stage C1, severe disease, but asymptomatic and compensated right and left ventricular function; stage C2, severe, but asymptomatic with decompensation of right <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular function; and stage D, hemodynamically severe and symptomatic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95224 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Though symptomatic severe AS is usually associated with a high gradient (stage D1), severe AS may also exist with a low transaortic volume flow rate due to either LV systolic dysfunction (stage D2) or with normal LV ejection fraction, perhaps owing to a small hypertrophied left ventricle with low stroke volume (stage D3).

In patients requiring urgent or emergent surgery, the evaluation for obstructive CAD should not delay a necessary noncardiac operation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients without valvular heart disease, the pre-operative assessment for CAD is made on the basis of symptoms and functional capacity. Given the physiologic changes that occur in patients with AS (LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, alterations in coronary flow reserve), the cause of cardiac symptoms (ie, obstructive CAD versus valvular disease) can be difficult to differentiate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Further complicating this issue is the frequency of concomitant AS and CAD with the prevalence of both increasing with age. Among older patients with symptomatic AS, the prevalence of CAD is 40 to 50 percent in those with typical angina and 20 percent in those without chest pain. Even in patients with AS who are less than 40 and have no chest pain and no coronary risk factors, the prevalence of CAD may be as high as 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H25097190\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of CAD'</a> above.) The risk of noncardiac surgery is also dependent upon the risk category of the surgical procedure; minor procedures with local anesthesia entail less risk. Perioperative complications include myocardial infarction, hypotension, heart failure, arrhythmias, and death. </p><p>General issues related to the estimation and management of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery, including initial risk assessment, the role of noninvasive testing and possible cardiac catheterization, and the indications for beta blocker and statin therapy, are discussed separately.

However, most preoperative risk models do not include AS as a risk factor because this condition was not adequately represented in the populations from which these risk assessment tools were generated. The following discussion will review issues specific to the perioperative risk associated with known AS. </p><p>The presence of AS, even if less than severe or asymptomatic, is associated with increased risk of postoperative adverse cardiac events after noncardiac surgery as identified in the 1977 study that led to the initial Goldman cardiac risk index for noncardiac surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>The risk of cardiac complications in patients with AS undergoing noncardiac surgery is approximately 10 to 30 percent, with higher risk in those with severe AS as illustrated by the following observations (as well as the studies below that include separate mortality data):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative risk of noncardiac surgery was compared in 5149 patients diagnosed with AS (severity not specified) and 10,284 controls from the National Hospital Discharge Survey database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The risk of myocardial infarction or death was significantly higher in patients with AS compared to controls (8.3 versus 7.2 percent) due to a higher risk of myocardial infarction (3.9 versus 2.0 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from the Netherlands of 108 patients with moderate or severe AS and 216 controls found that those with AS had significantly more frequent perioperative events (mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction) compared with those without AS (14 versus 2 percent; adjusted odds ratio of 5.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk of complications was greater in those with severe AS compared to those with moderate AS (31 versus 11 percent).</p><p/><p>The risk of mortality in patients with severe AS undergoing intermediate- or higher-risk surgery has been estimated to be approximately 6 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Differences in mortality rates among studies of patients with severe AS may be related to differences in case-mix of symptomatic versus asymptomatic disease. Higher mortality rates (3 to 9 percent) have been observed in patients with symptomatic severe AS and lower mortality rates (1 to 3 percent) observed in patients with asymptomatic severe AS as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Mayo Clinic Scottsdale study compared perioperative outcomes of noncardiac surgery for 30 patients with asymptomatic severe AS to those for 60 controls with mild to moderate AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Options for these patients include proceeding directly with the noncardiac surgery with careful perioperative management or first performing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The role of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) in these patients is uncertain.

The use of BAV is limited in older adults with AS because complications (eg, stroke, acute aortic regurgitation, and myocardial infarction) occur in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients. Restenosis and clinical deterioration occur in most cases within 6 to 12 months. Data are limited on the efficacy of this approach in general and as applied to preparation for noncardiac surgery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two small studies, each with only seven patients who had symptomatic AS, evaluated the outcomes in patients who underwent BAV prior to noncardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

The 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelines note that balloon valvuloplasty or TAVI may be considered in selected patients with symptomatic AS at high risk for adverse outcomes with valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9306142\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anesthesia team should be aware of the presence and severity of aortic stenosis (AS) and other cardiac risk factors. </p><p>For patients with severe AS undergoing major surgical procedures, we suggest invasive hemodynamic monitoring to ensure that loading conditions are continuously optimized. Hemodynamic monitoring should begin 12 to 24 hours preoperatively and continue for 24 to 48 hours postoperatively to cover the time period when major shifts in intravascular volume are likely to occur. Intraoperative monitoring should include right heart catheterization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, among patients with mild to moderate AS or patients with AS undergoing minor surgical procedures, noninvasive monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation by an experienced anesthesiologist is usually adequate.</p><p>Management recommendations are based in part upon observation of the following pathophysiologic changes with AS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chronic pressure overload state results in concentric hypertrophy, thereby reducing the compliance of the left ventricle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The concentric hypertrophy also reduces coronary reserve as discussed above, rendering the patient more susceptible to ischemia in situations of increased myocardial oxygen demand with and without the presence of concomitant coronary artery disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>These observations support the following treatment principles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of normal sinus rhythm with a moderate heart rate is important. Because the atrial &quot;kick&quot; may provide up to 40 percent of ventricular filling in patients with diastolic dysfunction or reduced left ventricular (LV) compliance, rhythms other than sinus rhythm can have deleterious hemodynamic effects. In particular, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may be poorly tolerated. Since stroke volume across the stenotic valve is relatively fixed, bradycardia (hazard ratio &lt;40) should also be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both vascular volume and preload must be maintained. Marked reductions in preload, as may be induced by anesthetics or other drugs, may be poorly tolerated because of impaired LV compliance. It is probably better to err on the side of minimal volume overload than hypovolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden reductions in systemic vascular resistance, as may be induced by epidural or spinal anesthesia, may result in a substantial decrease in coronary perfusion. Systemic hypotension and tachycardia should be avoided given the risk of myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, anesthesia techniques should be tailored to maintain an adequate systemic vascular resistance. Hypotension after induction of anesthesia should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, an alpha agonist that has no chronotropic properties. <br/><br/>Small studies have suggested the efficacy of an intravenous phenylephrine bolus during episodes of hypotension in patients with AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, the patients in these reports had mainly isolated AS, no significant coronary artery disease, and normal LV function.</p><p/><p>These principles apply before and during the surgical procedure and in the 48- to 72-hour postoperative period when major shifts in intravascular volume may occur, depending upon the type of surgical procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65933329\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
