Accumulating evidence on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU)-associated hepatotoxicity, particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], led to changes in recommendations for the use of thionamides. At a 2009 joint meeting of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it was recommended that PTU <strong>not</strong> be prescribed as a first-line drug in children or adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. PTU has a &quot;boxed warning&quot; because of the risk of liver failure. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hepatotoxicity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease#H1078101806\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Choice of drug'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be made aware of side effects at the time of drug initiation, preferably in writing, and at subsequent visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Common, minor side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> and PTU can cause pruritus, rash, urticaria, arthralgias, arthritis, fever, abnormal taste sensation, nausea, or vomiting in up to 13 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one trial, the percentage of patients who discontinued antithyroid drugs due to adverse reactions was 17, 29, and 34 percent for 15 or 30 mg of methimazole or PTU, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Mild skin reactions can be treated with antihistamine therapy without stopping <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> or PTU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], with the caveat that some skin reactions from PTU may be indicative of vasculitis. If one drug is not tolerated, the other drug can be substituted, but up to 50 percent of patients have cross-sensitivity. For patients with serious allergic reactions, prescribing the alternative drug is not recommended, and the patient should be managed with radioiodine or surgery.</p><p>The gastrointestinal side effects are dose dependent. Thus, we prefer to use divided doses in patients taking higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> (&ge;20 mg) and then change to single daily dosing if tolerated and as the dose is reduced.

This topic is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment#H2264875150\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Choice of thionamide'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1335728918\"><span class=\"h2\">Rare but serious adverse effects</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Agranulocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agranulocytosis is a rare but serious complication of thionamide therapy with a prevalence of 0.1 to 0.5 percent, and it usually occurs within the first two to three months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The risk of agranulocytosis from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> (but not PTU) appears to be dose related. Compared with low doses of methimazole, PTU (any dose) appears more likely to cause agranulocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, if a patient develops agranulocytosis with either PTU or methimazole, use of the other drug is contraindicated due to risk of crossreactivity.</p><p>In one study from Japan, the average time to onset of agranulocytosis was 69 days (range 11 to 233 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risk of agranulocytosis is higher for thionamides than for 20 other classes of drugs associated with this rare complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one study, agranulocytosis was more frequent in older patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> in doses higher than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], while in two other studies, agranulocytosis was more common with doses &gt;20 mg daily versus 5 to 15 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>], and in a third study, no cases were seen with methimazole doses under 30 mg and the prevalence of agranulocytosis with PTU was dose independent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In the United Kingdom, reports of agranulocytosis are more common with PTU than carbimazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Most cases occur within three months after treatment is begun. However, a Japanese study found that the development of agranulocytosis from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> was independent of dose, age, duration of treatment, or second exposure to the thionamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Controversy exists as to the value of monitoring white blood cell (WBC) counts. Most clinicians in the United States do not perform periodic monitoring, and the ATA guidelines do not recommend monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, a study from Japan was able to identify 78 percent of cases of granulocytopenia before the development of agranulocytosis or the onset of symptoms by checking blood counts every two weeks for the first two months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. We advise patients taking a thionamide to have an immediate white cell count with differential at the earliest sign of a fever, sore throat, or other infection and to discontinue the drug until the result is available.

In a Japanese registry, 30 of 754 cases (4 percent) were fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been used as adjunctive therapy in severe cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], but its efficacy was called into question in an older, randomized, prospective, controlled trial of 24 patients with a thionamide-induced neutrophil count of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL,</span> showing no difference in the time to neutrophil recovery between those who received G-CSF versus those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, this study has been criticized because of its small sample size (n = 24) and the use of a likely inadequate dose of G-CSF (100 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day)</span>. Subsequent nonrandomized studies have documented the effectiveness of hematopoietic growth factors to decrease the time to WBC normalization and the length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, there is no firm evidence that such therapy impacts mortality from antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Glucocorticoid therapy is ineffective.

A literature survey published in 1997 reported 49 cases of hepatotoxicity, 28 associated with PTU (including seven deaths) and 21 associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> (including three deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There was no relationship between a fatal outcome and either the dose or duration of thionamide treatment.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> has been associated with liver disease, reports from the United States had suggested it is typically due to cholestatic dysfunction not hepatocellular inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In contrast, studies from Taiwan and China suggest similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] or higher rates of hepatitis with methimazole than PTU when the dose exceeded 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], although the risk of liver failure was less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; almost all cases occurred within the first 180 days of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>PTU, on the other hand, can cause fulminant hepatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/4,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29</a>]. Over the past 20 years, 22 cases of severe hepatotoxicity in adults in the United States resulted in nine deaths and five liver transplants. Over the same period, 12 children developed liver failure resulting in three deaths and six liver transplants. It was estimated that this complication occurs in 1:10,000 adults taking PTU, with an even greater risk in children (1:2000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. PTU-related hepatotoxicity typically occurs within 90 days of starting the medication (although cases occurring up to one year have been reported), and it is not dose related. These data have led to changes in recommendations for the use of thionamides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease#H1078101806\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Choice of drug'</a>.)</p><p>Patients taking PTU or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> who develop jaundice, dark urine, light stools, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, or other evidence of hepatic dysfunction should be told to discontinue the drug immediately and to contact the clinician for assessment of liver function (transaminases, bilirubin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. PTU should not be used if transaminases reach three times the upper limit of normal and fail to improve on repeat testing one week later. After discontinuation, liver function tests should be monitored weekly until normalization. If they do not normalize, immediate referral to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2303719009\"><span class=\"h3\">ANCA-positive vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis has been reported in association with PTU use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There is also a possible association between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> and ANCA-positive vasculitis, but the number of cases is too small to establish a cause-and-effect relationship. This is one of several reasons why we strongly prefer the use of methimazole or carbimazole rather than PTU.</p><p>In a review of studies of patients with thionamide-induced ANCA-positive vasculitis, ANCA were present in 4 to 64 percent of patients taking PTU and 0 to 16 percent of patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>; however, only approximately 15 percent (1 in 6) of ANCA-positive patients develop clinical evidence of vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-toxicity-of-thionamides/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
