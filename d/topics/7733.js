Compared with the general population, the lifespan of patients with geriatric bipolar disorder is reduced by an average of 10 years, and the rate of completed suicide is 12 to 13 times greater in patients. (See <a href=\"#H7214018\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment for geriatric bipolar disorder includes a psychiatric history and mental status examination, with emphasis upon depressive and manic symptoms. The work-up also includes a general medical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory tests and imaging studies that assess for general medical disorders such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, coronary heart disease, and asthma.
