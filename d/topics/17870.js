As a result, patients with this disorder are not likely to have a good response to hormone administration (as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> [dDAVP]) or to drugs that increase either the renal response to ADH or ADH secretion.</p><p>Nephrogenic DI can be hereditary or acquired. In adults, a concentrating defect severe enough to produce polyuria due to nephrogenic DI is most often due to chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> use or hypercalcemia and less frequently to other conditions that impair tubular function, such as Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Release of ureteral obstruction is often associated with a diuresis, but this is short lived and does not require specific therapy other than maintenance fluids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis#H1323380487\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis and recovery of renal function'</a>.)</p><p>Hereditary nephrogenic DI, which is largely an X-linked disease, may also be seen by internists since early recognition and treatment in infancy has led to survival to adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, affected women may be carriers with few or no symptoms until pregnancy or other stress.</p><p>In infants with hereditary nephrogenic DI, treatment is aimed at minimizing the polyuria and avoiding hypernatremia and volume depletion. In adults, therapy is usually aimed at correcting the underlying disorder or discontinuing an offending drug. In hypercalcemic patients, for example, normalization of the plasma calcium concentration usually leads to amelioration of polyuria. By contrast, lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be irreversible if the patient already has severe tubular injury and a marked concentrating defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-toxicity-of-lithium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal toxicity of lithium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to the treatment of polyuria in patients with nephrogenic DI will be reviewed here. The causes of nephrogenic DI, the diagnostic approach to polyuria, and the treatment of central DI are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine output in patients with nephrogenic DI can be lowered with a low-salt, low-protein diet, diuretics, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In infants, early recognition is of immediate clinical significance because treatment can avert the physical and mental retardation that results from repeated episodes of dehydration and hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adults, the decision to undertake treatment must be based upon the individual patient's intolerance of the polyuria and polydipsia since, in almost all patients, the thirst mechanism is sufficient to maintain the plasma sodium in the high-normal range. The treatment of patients with hypernatremia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations in hereditary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given their inability to independently respond to increased thirst, infants and very young children should be offered water every two hours during the day and night. In severe cases, continuous gastric feeding may be required. However, the ingestion of large quantities of water may exacerbate physiologic gastroesophageal reflux in infants and toddlers, which may require treatment. Appetite and growth should be monitored closely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The high urine flow associated with hereditary nephrogenic DI induces dilatation of the urinary tract (hydronephrosis) and bladder in &ge;50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. A rare complication is progressive loss of renal function and possible end-stage renal disease, probably related to voluntary retention of urine leading to bladder dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. These problems may also occur with other causes of massive urine volumes, most commonly seen with primary polydipsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Decreasing urine flow with the interventions discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and frequent voiding and &quot;double voiding&quot; (to empty the bladder entirely), are important preventive measures. This approach should be taught to children once they are old enough, and should be continued in adulthood, to prevent severe dilatation of the urinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20129240\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations in patients requiring intravenous fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients, particularly children, with nephrogenic DI who have extrarenal fluid losses (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever) frequently require intravenous fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Both 5 percent dextrose in water and one-quarter isotonic (0.22 percent) saline are usually well tolerated, but a replacement fluid that has a higher osmolality than the urine (eg, one-half isotonic [0.45 percent] saline) can produce hypernatremia, even though it may have a lower osmolality as compared with plasma. As an example, a patient who has a maximal urine osmolality of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> will need to excrete 1.54 liters of urine for each liter of 0.45 percent saline received in order to excrete the osmotic load, resulting in a net loss of 0.54 liters of water. However, if hypotonic fluids are administered at a rate higher than the urine output, hyponatremia can ensue. These considerations should be taken into account in order to prevent complications in patients with nephrogenic DI requiring intravenous fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased dietary solute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the urine osmolality is fixed, as in nephrogenic DI, the urine output is determined by solute excretion. Suppose that the maximum urine osmolality is 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>. In this setting, the daily urine volume will be 5 liters if solute excretion is in the normal range at 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day,</span> but only 3 liters if solute excretion is lowered to 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day</span> by dietary modification.</p><p>These observations provide the rationale for the use of a low-salt, low-protein diet to diminish the urine output in nephrogenic DI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. The reduction in urine output will be directly proportional to the decrease in solute intake and excretion. Restriction of salt intake to &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> (2.3 g sodium) and protein intake to &le;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> may be reasonable goals, but such diets are not easy to achieve and maintain. Furthermore, protein restriction in infants and young children may be harmful and is not advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although most children with nephrogenic DI are underweight and relatively short during the first years of life, their height and weight become progressively normal during school-age years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These growth observations could be related, in part, to limited caloric intake and decreased dietary solute during the first years of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thiazide diuretics in combination with a low-solute diet can diminish the degree of polyuria in patients with nephrogenic DI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-18</a>]. The potassium-sparing diuretic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> also may be helpful, both by its additive effect with the thiazide diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and, with reversible lithium-induced disease, by possibly allowing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> to be continued (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A thiazide diuretic (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, 25 mg once or twice daily) acts by inducing mild volume depletion. As little as a 1 to 1.5 kg weight loss can reduce the urine output by more than 50 percent (eg, from 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> to below 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> in a study of patients with nephrogenic DI on a severely sodium-restricted diet [9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>This effect is presumably mediated by a hypovolemia-induced increase in proximal sodium and water reabsorption, thereby diminishing water delivery to the antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-sensitive sites in the collecting tubules and reducing the urine output. Diuretic therapy can lead to a variety of usually mild electrolyte complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=time-course-of-loop-and-thiazide-diuretic-induced-electrolyte-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Time course of loop and thiazide diuretic-induced electrolyte complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H27627359\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diuretics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretic-induced hyperuricemia and gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial natriuresis and therefore the later antipolyuric response can be enhanced by combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> (or other potassium-sparing diuretic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This regimen has an additional benefit since amiloride partially blocks the potassium wasting induced by the thiazide.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiloride</a> may be particularly beneficial in patients with reversible <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> nephrotoxicity, given its site and mechanism of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. If amiloride is used, a small contraction of extracellular fluid volume may ensue, and it may be necessary to decrease the dose of lithium chronically administered and to measure plasma concentrations at frequent intervals until a new steady state is achieved. This drug closes the sodium channels in the luminal membrane of the collecting tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These channels constitute the mechanism by which filtered lithium normally enters these cells and then interferes with their response to ADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The permeability for lithium of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is 1.5- to 2-fold higher than that for sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Whereas sodium is extruded from the interior of the cell to the blood compartment by the sodium pump (Na-K-ATPase) located at the basolateral membrane, lithium is a poor substrate for the sodium pump. As a consequence, toxic intracellular levels could build up quickly in all cells expressing ENaC at their plasma membrane and exposed to therapeutic concentrations of lithium (0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-toxicity-of-lithium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal toxicity of lithium&quot;</a>). Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3 beta) is inhibited by lithium and is probably the common molecular target for the primary and secondary toxic effects of lithium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetazolamide</a> monotherapy is as effective as the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> in reducing polyuria in an animal model of lithium-induced nephrogenic DI but has fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Human data are limited, although acetazolamide was used successfully in a patient with lithium-induced nephrogenic DI and produced an increase in urine osmolality from 250 to 339 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A loop diuretic, although also capable of inducing mild volume depletion, is not as likely to lower the urine output in nephrogenic DI. These agents decrease sodium chloride reabsorption in the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, thereby decreasing the accumulation of NaCl in the medullary interstitium that is essential for the production of a concentrated urine. Thus, a loop diuretic induces relative ADH resistance, an effect that is counterproductive in nephrogenic DI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of NSAIDs in this setting is dependent upon inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. In normal subjects, prostaglandins antagonize the action of ADH and NSAIDs increase concentrating ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. If, for example, normal subjects are given a submaximal dose of ADH, the ensuing rise in urine osmolality can be increased by more than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> if the patient has been pretreated with an NSAID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The net effect in patients with DI may be a 25 to 50 percent reduction in urine output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/17,18,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,31</a>], a response that is partially additive to that of a thiazide diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>].</p><p>This approach is particularly beneficial in patients with polyuria due to complex congenital polyuric-polydipsic Bartter-like syndromes, in whom prostaglandins appear to be pathogenetically important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes#H3869754\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartter and Gitelman syndromes&quot;, section on 'Role of prostaglandins'</a>.)</p><p>Not all NSAIDs are equally effective in a given patient; as an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> appears to have a greater effect than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A variety of complications may ensue with long-term use of NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Exogenous ADH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with <strong>nonhereditary</strong> nephrogenic DI have partial rather than complete resistance to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It is therefore possible that attaining supraphysiologic hormone levels will increase the renal effect of ADH to a clinically important degree. In some patients with nephrogenic DI, exogenous ADH has been found to increase the urine osmolality by 40 to 45 percent, an effect that would be expected to produce a similar decline in urine volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/21,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,32,33</a>].</p><p>Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP) may be tried in patients who have persistent symptomatic polyuria after implementation of the above regimen. One case report of a patient with lithium-induced nephrogenic DI suggested that benefit may be more likely if desmopressin is combined with an NSAID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Experimental approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with congenital X-linked nephrogenic DI have defective V2 vasopressin receptors that are unable to properly fold intracellularly and, as a consequence, do not transfer to the cell surface where the receptors could respond to circulating vasopressin. Several new approaches to treatment of this disorder are being investigated: V2 receptor chaperones and V2 receptor bypass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Vasopressin V2 receptor gene mutations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6612734\"><span class=\"h3\">V2 receptor chaperones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In in vitro systems, the administration of selective, cell-permeable nonpeptide V2 and V1a receptor antagonists were able to rescue mutant V2 receptors, presumably acting intracellularly to promote proper folding and maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. This resulted in the expression of functional cell surface V2 receptors, suggesting that such a therapeutic approach may be effective in patients.</p><p>In a pilot study, a nonpeptide V1a receptor antagonist was administered to five men with nephrogenic DI (each with one of three identified mutations in the <em>AVPR2</em> gene that codes for the V2 receptor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This resulted in an increase in urine osmolality from a mean of 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> and reductions in urine volume from 12 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> and in water intake from 11 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span>. Nonpeptide V2 agonists have also been demonstrated experimentally to rescue misfolded <em>AVPR2</em> mutations responsible for X-linked nephrogenic DI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Most mutations in aquaporin-2 (the vasopressin-sensitive water channel) that are associated with nephrogenic DI result in proteins being retained in the intracellular space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Research to find chaperone-like molecules to help direct these proteins to the cell surface is ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6612741\"><span class=\"h3\">V2 receptor bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antidiuretic activity of the V2 receptor is mediated by the activation of a G protein-signaling cascade that leads to increased<strong> </strong>intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and the trafficking of aquaporin-2 to the cell membrane. The collecting duct also expresses two prostaglandin E2 receptors (EP2 and EP4) and a beta-3 adrenergic receptor; similar to the V2 receptor-signaling cascade, these receptors can increase intracellular cyclic AMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Prostaglandin E2 and beta-3<sub> </sub>adrenergic signaling through these receptors increases the apical membrane abundance and phosphorylation of aquaporin-2.</p><p>Thus, stimulation of prostaglandin E2 receptors EP2 and EP4, and stimulation of beta-3 adrenergic receptors, may be a way of bypassing the need for V2 receptor signaling. In a mouse model of X-linked nephrogenic DI, for example, ONO-AE1-329, a selective agonist of the EP4 prostaglandin E2 receptor in the collecting tubule cells, increased urine osmolality from 150 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In adults, a concentrating defect severe enough to produce polyuria due to nephrogenic DI is most often due to chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> use or hypercalcemia and less frequently to other conditions that impair tubular function, such as Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. In infants, congenital nephrogenic DI is most common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a cause can be identified, we recommend correcting the underlying disorder (eg, hypercalcemia) or discontinuing the offending drug, if feasible. Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be irreversible if tubular injury is severe and there is a marked concentrating defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-toxicity-of-lithium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal toxicity of lithium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are usually no adverse medical effects of polyuria, although, as noted above, the functional hydronephrosis in congenital nephrogenic DI rarely leads to significant renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As a result, the only indication for therapy in adults is to relieve the patient's symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy of the polyuria in nephrogenic DI consists of the following sequential approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All adult patients should be instructed to take a low-sodium, low-protein diet, as tolerated, and all infants and young children should be provided a low-sodium diet. The reduction in urine output will be directly proportional to the fall in solute excretion. As a result, the efficacy of solute restriction will depend directly upon patient compliance. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Decreased dietary solute'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all patients who have significant polyuria, we recommend frequent and &quot;double-voiding&quot; to avoid bladder dilatation and dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all children, and in adults with symptomatic polyuria persisting despite a low-solute diet, we recommend starting a thiazide diuretic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> 25 mg once daily to a usual maximum of 25 mg twice daily in adults and appropriate dosing in children) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The preferred initial therapy is different in children with polyuria due to complex congenital polyuric-polydipsic Bartter-like syndromes, in whom we recommend nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes#H3869775\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartter and Gitelman syndromes&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> if the urine output is insufficiently reduced (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We recommend amiloride as part of primary therapy to prevent progression of, or possibly improve, lithium-induced DI in patients in whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is continued (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>In patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, a low-sodium diet and the use of thiazide <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> may increase the plasma level of lithium. Thus, frequent measurements of lithium and a decrease in the daily lithium dose may be necessary when initiating such treatments.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If symptomatic polyuria persists, we suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> if there are no contraindications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who cannot be treated with NSAIDs or who have persistent symptomatic polyuria after the addition of NSAIDs, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Exogenous ADH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are special considerations in the management of hereditary nephrogenic DI, particularly in infants and young children (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations in hereditary disease'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants and very young children, we recommend offering water every two hours, with the goal of avoiding severe dehydration and hypernatremia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If gastroesophageal reflux becomes problematic, we recommend appropriate management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all children, we recommend implementation of measures to decrease urine flow, as discussed above, and frequent and &quot;double voiding,&quot; with the goal of avoiding dilatation of the urinary tract and bladder (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). We suggest continuing these preventive measures to avoid dilatation of the urinary tract in adulthood.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rose BD, Post TW.
