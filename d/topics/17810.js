Delayed therapy can lead to ischemic injury and possibly to irreversible shock and multiorgan system failure. Three issues generally need to be considered in this setting: the rate of fluid replacement; the type of fluid infused; and the role for buffer therapy in patients with concurrent lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vasopressors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>) generally should not be administered, since they do not correct the primary problem and tend to further reduce tissue perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Manifestations and diagnose of volume depletion are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATE OF FLUID REPLETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not possible to precisely predict the total fluid deficit in a given patient with hypovolemic shock, particularly if fluid loss continues (eg, persistent bleeding or third space sequestration). In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial &ndash; At least one to two liters of isotonic crystalloid are initially given as rapidly as possible in an attempt to restore tissue perfusion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Early correction of the volume deficit is essential in hypovolemic shock to prevent the decline in tissue perfusion from becoming irreversible. Irreversible shock is associated with loss of vascular tone, a drop in systemic vascular resistance, pooling of blood in the capillaries and tissues, and an impaired response to vasoactive medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance &ndash; Fluid repletion should continue at the initial rapid rate as long as the systemic blood pressure remains low in the setting of hypovolemia. Clinical signs, including blood pressure (eg, mean arterial pressure 65 to 70 mmHg, no greater than 70 mmHg), urine output, mental status, and peripheral perfusion, are often adequate to guide resuscitation. The development of peripheral edema is often due to acute dilutional hypoalbuminemia and should not be used as a marker for adequate fluid resuscitation or fluid overload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring fluid repletion &ndash; Additional monitoring is appropriate in patients who fail to respond to initial fluid resuscitation in the first one to two hours. In such patients, measurement of the central venous pressure can help direct therapy. </p><p/><p>If central venous pressure monitoring is not available, cannot be performed, or yields confusing data, respiratory variation in the arterial pressure tracing can be used to estimate the adequacy of fluid resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Large respirophasic variations in the arterial systolic pressure and pulse pressure are qualitatively linked to persistent hypovolemia and right ventricular underfilling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/4,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,8</a>]. Respirophasic pulse pressure variation provides information about the likelihood that the cardiac output will increase in response to an increase in left ventricular preload; it does not provide an absolute assessment of volume status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The use of pulse pressure variation to assess volume responsiveness is only valid in mechanically ventilated patients and is unreliable at predicting the volume responsiveness of spontaneously breathing patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. There is little added value from measurement of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, unless the patient has underlying cardiopulmonary disease.

As an obvious example, blood components are indicated in patients who are bleeding. In this situation, the hematocrit generally should not be targeted above 30 percent because excessive increases are not essential for oxygen transport and may increase blood viscosity, potentially leading to stasis in the already compromised capillary circulation. Isotonic crystalloids are generally preferred for the management of patients with severe volume depletion not due to bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Colloid versus crystalloid</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H414501503\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both crystalloids (eg, isotonic saline, Ringer's lactate) and colloid-containing solutions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a>, hyperoncotic starch) have been used to replace the extracellular fluid deficit. In general, crystalloids, usually saline solutions, are preferred over colloid-containing solutions for the management of patients with severe volume depletion not due to bleeding. Saline solutions seem to be as effective as other crystalloid solutions and colloid-containing solutions, and are much less expensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Hyperoncotic starch solutions should be avoided as they increase the risk of acute kidney injury, need for renal replacement therapy and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. </p><p>Crystalloids and in particular saline solutions are equally effective as colloid in expanding the plasma volume, although 1.5 to 3 times as much saline must be given because of its extravascular distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/12,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22-25</a>]. This is not necessarily deleterious, however, since fluid loss also leads to an interstitial fluid deficit that is repaired by saline administration.</p><p>Colloid-containing solutions are not more effective in preserving pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/12,22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22,26,27</a>]. This lack of protection is due, at least in part, to the relatively high permeability of the alveolar capillaries to albumin, leading to a higher interstitial oncotic pressure than in subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As hypoalbuminemia occurs, there is a parallel reduction in alveolar interstitial protein concentration, since less albumin moves across the capillary wall. The net effect is little or no change in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient and, therefore, little tendency to the development of pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In comparison, acute saline-induced hypoalbuminemia can lead to peripheral edema, which is a cosmetic but not life-threatening problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>However, renewed support for the use of colloids for the treatment of hypovolemic shock (not due to bleeding) comes from a nine-year, multicenter, open-label trial (CRISTAL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In CRISTAL, 2857 patients with hypovolemic shock due to any cause were randomly assigned to resuscitation with intravenous crystalloid or colloid solutions. There was no difference in 28-day mortality or need for renal replacement therapy between the groups. However, patients treated with colloids had more days free of mechanical ventilation (13.5 versus 14.6 days) and vasopressor therapy (15.2 versus 16.2 days), as well as a lower 90-day mortality (31 versus 34 percent). The open-label design, lengthy study period, and heterogeneity of fluids that were compared between the groups, limit confidence in the apparent benefit of colloid solutions in this population. Further validation of any potential benefit of colloids will be required before they can be routinely administered as first-line therapy for the resuscitation of patients with hypovolemic shock. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1292163\"><span class=\"h3\">Albumin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians advocate the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a> because of two possible advantages over fluid repletion with an isotonic saline solution: (1) more rapid plasma volume expansion, since the colloid solution remains in the vascular space (in contrast to saline, three quarters of which enters the interstitium), and (2) lesser risk of pulmonary edema, since dilutional hypoalbuminemia will not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Randomized trials and meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate benefits from the use of albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/12-14,22,26,27,32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14,22,26,27,32-37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A well-executed multicenter trial randomly assigned nearly 7000 hypovolemic medical and surgical ICU patients to fluid resuscitation using either 4 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a> or normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All-cause mortality at 28 days (the primary end point of the study), multiorgan failure, the duration of hospitalization, and effect upon systemic pH were similar in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, in patients with head trauma, resuscitation with albumin was associated with higher mortality than resuscitation with saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 55 studies, published before the above trial, pooled and analyzed data from nearly 3000 critically ill patients randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a> or crystalloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. There was no evidence for either improved outcomes or increased mortality in patients given albumin. Subset analysis identified no group of patients, including those with trauma, burns, hypoalbuminemia, or ascites, that derived statistically significant benefit or harm from albumin transfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350842018\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperoncotic starch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concern has been raised about risks associated with the use of hyperoncotic starch solutions. Use of hyperoncotic starch solutions has been associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury, and in some studies, increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/17-20,37,41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20,37,41-46</a>]. The lack of benefit and potential adverse effects of starch solutions for critically ill patients, including the subgroup with septic shock, are illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, 7000 ICU patients were assigned to receive 6 percent hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or isotonic saline for all fluid resuscitation until ICU discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

This trial is discussed in more detail separately.

This is supported by animal data that indicates that the outcome of hemorrhagic shock correlates with tissue hypoxia. This subject is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-carriers-as-alternatives-to-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen carriers as alternatives to red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Buffered crystalloid versus isotonic saline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the intravenous solutions used for fluid resuscitation in critically-ill patients are hyperchloremic (eg, isotonic saline) relative to plasma, such that large volume resuscitation using isotonic saline may be associated with the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. This has led to suggestions that isotonic fluids with lower chloride concentration (also known as buffered or balanced crystalloids including lactated-Ringers solution, lactated-Hartmann solution, 0.45 percent saline solution with 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, or Plasma-lyte) be used instead of isotonic saline for large volume resuscitation. We suggest that the choice between balanced solutions and normal saline be individualized and informed by&nbsp;factors including patient chemistries, estimated volume of resuscitation (which can be difficult to predict), and potential adverse effects of the solution used (eg, hyponatremia [Ringer&rsquo;s lactate] and hyperchloremic acidosis [normal saline])&nbsp;as well as institutional and physician preference. The clinician should have a low threshold to re-evaluate the type of fluid administered depending on the patient's response and development of adverse effects. The rationale for this recommendation is based upon the lack of an ideal standard resuscitation solution, data from randomized trials that have not shown a consistent benefit in hospital mortality or preservation of kidney function with balanced crystalloids as compared with saline (particularly for patients in whom smaller volumes are administered [eg, &lt;2L]), and cumulative evidence from subgroup analyses that suggest potential benefit from balanced crystalloids in those in whom large volumes of fluids are administered (eg, &ge;2 liters). </p><p>Early studies were conflicting on the benefits of balanced crystalloids compared with isotonic saline:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial 2012 and 2015 study reported a reduced incidence of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients in whom a chloride&ndash;restrictive strategy was used (eg, Hartman's solution, chloride-poor albumin, Plasma-Lyte 148) compared with standard intravenous fluids (typically isotonic saline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Similarly, a 2015 meta-analysis of 21 small randomized or open-label studies reported similar reduction in the incidence of acute kidney injury without a difference in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a subsequent randomized trial involving 2278 critically ill non-trauma patients (mostly postoperative) found no difference in the risk of acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, patients in this trial were not severely ill and did not require large-volume resuscitation (average volume administered was 2 L or less). Another 2017 single-center cluster-randomized trial comparing isotonic saline to balanced crystalloid solutions among 974 critically ill adults also found no difference in the composite of death, dialysis, or persistent kidney dysfunction within 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, the composite outcome occurred more frequently in patients assigned to receive isotonic saline when larger volumes of isotonic crystalloid were administered.</p><p/><p>However, two large 2018 trials reported possible benefit from the use of balanced crystalloids in critically ill and non-critically ill patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial including 15,802 adults in five intensive care units in one institution found that balanced crystalloids (lactated-Ringers solution or Plasma-Lyte A) resulted in a modest reduction in a composite outcome of death from any cause at 30 days, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction, when compared with isotonic saline (14.35 versus 15.4 percent), but no significant difference in the rates of the individual components of the outcome were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A pre-specified analysis of patients with sepsis (who received higher volumes than the median of approximately 1 L) found infusion of balanced crystalloids to be associated with a lower 30-day mortality (25.2 versus 29.4 percent; adjusted odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94). No differences in in-hospital death, ICU- ventilator- or vasopressor-free days, rates of stage-2 or higher AKI, or creatinine levels before discharge were reported. Another parallel trial including 13,347 non-critically ill patients treated in the emergency department and subsequently hospitalized outside the ICU found that compared with isotonic saline, balanced crystalloids did not affect the number of hospital-free days but did result in a modest reduction in the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (4.7 versus 5.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Although well-conducted, both of these studies were criticized for issues including small median volumes of infusion, heterogeneity of the populations studied, and a response in a composite outcome that was marginal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that further well designed trials will be conducted in the near future to help the clinician choose isotonic saline or balanced crystalloids for fluid resuscitation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802733207\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with marked hypoperfusion may develop lactic acidosis, leading to a reduction in extracellular pH below 7.10. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> has been added to the replacement fluid in this setting, in an attempt to correct both the acidemia and the volume deficit.

Delayed therapy can lead to ischemic injury and possibly to irreversible shock and multiorgan system failure. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least one to two liters of isotonic crystalloid are initially given as rapidly as possible in an attempt to restore tissue perfusion. Early correction of the volume deficit is essential in hypovolemic shock to prevent the decline in tissue perfusion from becoming irreversible. Fluid repletion continues at the initial rapid rate as long as the systemic blood pressure remains low. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rate of fluid repletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical signs, including blood pressure, urine output, mental status, and peripheral perfusion, are often adequate to guide resuscitation. A central venous catheter is often placed in patients who fail to respond promptly to initial fluid resuscitation. If central venous pressure monitoring is not available or cannot be performed, respiratory variation in the arterial pressure tracing can be used to estimate the adequacy of fluid resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rate of fluid repletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe non-hemorrhagic hypovolemia or non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend initial fluid replacement with an isotonic crystalloid solution rather than a hyperoncotic starch solution (eg, hydroxyethyl starch [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hetastarch-hydroxyethyl-starch-450-0-7-hespan-hextend-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hetastarch</a>]) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Colloid versus crystalloid'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest initial fluid replacement with an isotonic crystalloid solution rather than an albumin-containing solution (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Colloid versus crystalloid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among crystalloids, the choice between balanced solutions and normal saline is individualized and informed by&nbsp;factors including patient chemistries, estimated volume of resuscitation, potential adverse effect of the solution used (eg, hyponatremia [Ringer's lactate] and hyperchloremic acidosis [normal saline]&nbsp;as well as institutional and physician preference. The clinician should have a low threshold to re-evaluate the type of fluid administered depending on the patient's response and development of adverse effects. The rationale for this recommendation is based upon the lack of an ideal standard crystalloid resuscitation solution, data from randomized trials that is conflicting but may suggest potential benefit from balanced crystalloids in those in whom large volumes of fluids are administered (eg, &gt;2 liters). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Buffered crystalloid versus isotonic saline'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe hemorrhagic hypovolemia or hemorrhagic shock, red blood cell transfusions are an appropriate choice for initial volume resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Choice of replacement fluid'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of blood products in the critically ill&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with marked hypoperfusion due to hypovolemia may develop lactic acidosis. The efficacy of alkali therapy (eg, intravenous bicarbonate) in this situation is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H1802733207\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Rose BD, Post TW.
