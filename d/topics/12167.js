Approximately 10 to 20 percent of all kidney stones require surgical removal, which is determined based upon the presence of symptoms and the size and location of the stones. Larger stones and proximal ureteral stones are less likely to pass spontaneously. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Facilitation of stone passage'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Stone passage'</a>.)</p><p>Stone removal is also indicated for pain or obstruction or for an infected struvite stone. On the other hand, no specific surgical therapy is required for asymptomatic stones, particularly those that are less than 5 mm in diameter.</p><p>Three minimally invasive surgical techniques that significantly reduce the morbidity of stone removal are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rigid and flexible ureteroscopy (URS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) </p><p/><p>These techniques appear to offer comparable success when compared with open renal and ureteral surgery, and provide significant advantages in terms of patient morbidity and cost. In addition, improvements in urologic equipment, fluoroscopic technology, and interventional radiologic techniques provide many additional treatment options.</p><p>The choice of intervention for stones that are unlikely to pass spontaneously varies with the location and size of the stone. Studies suggest that either SWL or URS is a viable option for managing ureteral calculi. SWL is the treatment of choice for most small renal calculi, while PNL is the preferred method of stone removal for larger (&gt;2 cm) renal stones, including staghorn calculi. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of struvite or staghorn calculi&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, a nephrostomy tube may be placed as a temporizing measure, usually for patients who present with an obstructing stone and sepsis. Proper drainage of the infected urine is essential. Once the infection has cleared, the stone may be removed by one of the methods previously listed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROLITHOTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;endourology&quot; was adopted in the late 1970s to describe the &quot;closed, controlled manipulation of the entire urinary system.&quot; This term was initially used to describe the technique of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNL and open surgery are equally effective for the management of renal stones. In one study of 129 patients with renal calculi, for example, we found that PNL and open renal surgery were associated with a similar success and complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An important difference was that PNL shortened the hospitalization time by 60 percent and allowed the patient to return to work in approximately one week as compared to greater than three weeks after open renal surgery. This less invasive technique is also 40 percent less expensive than open renal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although comparable in efficacy to open surgery, the advent of SWL has limited the need for routine PNL (see below). Percutaneous stone removal procedures are reserved for patients with the following clinical characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large (&gt;2 cm in diameter) or complex calculi (filling the majority of the intrarenal collecting system, such as staghorn calculi) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of struvite or staghorn calculi&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystine stones (relatively resistant to shock wave lithotripsy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic abnormalities, including horseshoe kidneys or ureteropelvic junction obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stones within calyceal diverticula</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technical advances and increased operator experience have resulted in considerable refinement of the percutaneous approach to renal calculi. Significant reductions in morbidity and cost have occurred because of the development of nephrostomy tract balloon dilators, improved grasping instruments, and the use of improved methods of stone fragmentation and removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The key to successful PNL is the adequate placement of the nephrostomy tract, thereby allowing appropriate access for complete stone removal. It is extremely important that the urologist and radiologist confer prior to placement of the nephrostomy tube to ensure that the nephrostomy tract will allow easy access to calculi.</p><p>The nephrostomy tract may be placed either as an outpatient procedure in the angiography suite just prior to hospital admission or may be performed as a &quot;single stage procedure&quot; under the same general anesthetic as percutaneous stone removal. We employ the latter approach, which is performed in our special procedures-angiography suite within the operating room. The procedure involves the following sequential steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the patient in a supine position, a retrograde ureteral catheter is placed using a 15F flexible cystoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After turning the patient to a prone position, the renal collecting system is accessed via an 18 gauge needle under fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After dilation of the tract to 32F with a nephrostomy balloon dilator, a 30F working sheath is placed into the renal collecting system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All calculi are extracted with grasping forceps using a rigid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flexible nephroscope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fragmented using an ultrasonic, pneumatic, or combined <span class=\"nowrap\">ultrasonic/pneumatic</span> lithotripsy probe using a rigid nephroscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following successful stone removal, it is standard to leave a 10F pigtail catheter in the renal pelvis as a nephrostomy tube with a 5F catheter placed down the ureter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, various studies suggest that foregoing the nephrostomy tube at the end of the procedure (ie, &quot;tubeless&quot; percutaneous nephrolithotomy) is just as safe and effective as the standard approach of leaving a nephrostomy tube in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. A meta-analysis of 50 reports document comparable complication rates between tubeless and standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy demonstrated advantages such as less pain, less debilitation, less cost, and a shorter hospital stay. The mean stone-free rates for tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy were as high as 89 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, some studies suggest that an internal ureteral stent does not need to be used with a tubeless PNL. This so-called &quot;tubeless, stentless&quot; PNL procedure offers a further reduction in patient morbidity, as the internal stent-related symptoms are avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320426\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedural complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications of PNL were described in a large multicenter study that included 1448 single large kidney stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Procedural complications were more common with larger stones. Compared with those whose stones were 2 to 3 cm, patients whose stones were 4 to 6 cm required longer operative times (91 versus 71 minutes) and longer hospital stays (4.0 versus 3.7 days), and were more likely to have a postoperative fever (18 versus 8 percent) and to require a blood transfusion (13 versus 4 percent). Stone-free rates were also significantly lower (84 versus 90 percent). Calyceal stones were associated with more procedural complications than pelvic stones. </p><p>Infectious complications may also occur after PNL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a larger Chinese study, for example, 2.4 percent of patients developed sepsis following the procedure, which was much more common among diabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">URETEROSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of the ureteroscope has had a significant impact upon the management of ureteral calculi. Although many proximal ureteral or renal stones are managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Shock wave lithotripsy'</a> below), ureteroscopy continues to be the treatment of choice for the majority of middle and distal ureteral stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but also can be used to manage proximal ureteral and intrarenal calculi. In addition, ureteroscopic access is frequently useful for the management of ureteral calculi that have failed shock wave lithotripsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigid ureteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteral access and dilation are often the first components of ureteroscopy. We routinely employ ureteral balloon dilators, which are passed over guidewires that have been fluoroscopically positioned within the renal collecting system. After dilation of the distal ureter, the ureteroscope can then be passed under direct vision throughout the ureter and renal pelvis.</p><p>If the obstructing stone is small enough to be extracted intact, stone baskets or grasping forceps can be employed for stone removal. If, however, the stone is too large for intact extraction and requires fragmentation prior to removal, laser, pneumatic, ultrasonic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrohydraulic lithotripsy, as well as laser fragmentation can be utilized to perform &quot;intracorporeal lithotripsy.&quot;</p><p>Devices that combine pneumatic and ultrasonic features are also being developed. The initial experience with this device is favorable, with the instrument being efficacious and safe in removing large renal or bladder calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Advances in semirigid ureteroscopes have obviated the need for ureteral dilation in many patients. These small-caliber, mini-ureteroscopes are ideal for the management of middle and distal ureteral stones. We routinely employ a 6.5 French semirigid ureteroscope combined with either intracorporeal laser or electrohydraulic lithotripsy to manage stones in the lower two-thirds of the ureter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexible ureteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further innovations in fiberoptic technologies have propelled the development of flexible ureteroscopes. The widespread use of these new instruments has enabled routine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to be performed within the ureter and kidney. As an example, patients who present with hematuria and a filling defect of the upper pole collecting system can undergo direct visualization of the upper urinary tract. A therapeutic maneuver, such as extraction of symptomatic ureteral calculi, can also be performed with these devices.</p><p>With the addition of deflection capabilities, these newer endoscopes are now able to access the entire upper urinary tract, including the intrarenal collecting system. Renal lesions or stones located in the lower pole or extremely lateral calyces can now be reached with a combination of active and passive endoscope deflection. Rotation of the operator's hand will enable a 360&ordm; access to the entire intrarenal collecting system. While flexible ureteroscopes are used primarily to access the proximal ureter and intrarenal collecting system, the semi-rigid ureteroscopes can be utilized to reach lesions in the mid and distal ureter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for stent placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stents are sometimes placed after ureteroscopy, in part to help prevent ureteric obstruction and pain resulting from ureteral edema or passage of a stone fragment. Routine placement of stents after uncomplicated ureteroscopy should be discouraged. In three meta-analyses of trials evaluating patients who underwent ureteroscopic lithotripsy, compared with those who did not receive a stent, patients receiving stents had more lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, frequency or urgency, and hematuria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. While there was no difference in stone-free rate, fever, urinary tract infection, requirement for analgesia, urinary strictures, or unplanned rehospitalization in two of the meta-analyses, a third meta-analysis showed that patients receiving stents were less likely to require hospital readmission within 30 days of their operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although routine placement of stents is not required, stenting should be performed in patients with urinary tract abnormalities or solitary kidneys and when bilateral simultaneous ureteroscopy is performed. Stenting is also necessary if there is residual edema or inflammation secondary to the stone or the endoscopic removal procedure. Ultimately, a more comfortable ureteral stent will reduce patient morbidity while protecting patients from postoperative ureteroscopic problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SHOCK WAVE LITHOTRIPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is perhaps the most significant advance related to the removal of renal and ureteral stones. Many renal and ureteral stones are managed by this technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ureteral-calculi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ureteral calculi&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, SWL is not the ideal modality for the management of large or complex calculi. Alternative modes of stone removal should be considered for large or hard calculi, stones located in a calyceal diverticulum, or in patients with complex renal anatomy. Procedures such as percutaneous stone removal or a ureteroscopic approach can greatly facilitate stone removal and correct underlying anatomic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In a cohort of 137 patients with renal calculi measuring 11 to 20 mm in diameter, single treatment success rates were significantly better in those who underwent percutaneous stone removal (95 percent) and ureteroscopy (88 percent) compared with SWL (60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>SWL employs high energy shock waves produced by an electrical discharge. The shock waves are transmitted through water and directly focused onto a <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/ureteral</span> stone with the aid of biplanar fluoroscopy. The change in tissue density between the soft renal tissue and the hard stone causes a release of energy at the stone surface. This energy fragments the stone.</p><p>While lithotriptor technology is quite effective in fragmenting the majority of renal and ureteral calculi, there continues to be some debate concerning the potential deleterious effects of the high-energy shock waves, such as hypertension, renal injury, and, in men, sperm DNA damage and a temporary decline in fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal complications of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>We believe that &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of shock wave parameters (ie, shock wave intensity, rate, focal position, etc.) may allow improved stone fragmentation with reduced renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].

Less than one percent of patients are candidates for such surgery.</p><p>Open stone surgery is primarily reserved for the management of complex renal and ureteral calculi that cannot be removed with a reasonable number of minimally invasive procedures. Indications include patients who have failed endoscopic stone removal, patients with complex (staghorn) renal calculi, and patients with complex <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/ureteral</span> anatomy or morbidly obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of new stone formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The enthusiasm for PNL, ureteroscopy, and SWL must not overshadow the importance of medical therapy to prevent new stone formation. A treatable metabolic etiology of stone formation can be detected in more than 95 percent of patients evaluated for stone disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of medical treatments may correct the underlying metabolic defects responsible for stone formation, thereby reducing the occurrence of new stone formation. Examples for which controlled trials have demonstrated benefit include a high fluid intake for all forms of stone disease, a thiazide diuretic for hypercalciuria, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> or potassium citrate for hyperuricosuria, potassium citrate for hypocitraturia, and potassium citrate for uric acid stone formation due to persistently acid urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid nephrolithiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With medical treatment, we have found remission of stone disease in more than 75 percent and a reduced rate of stone passage in more than 94 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In a study of 80 patients with renal stones treated with lithotripsy, medical therapy was highly effective in reducing the recurrence rate of stones in patients with residual fragments (from 1.17 to 0.00 stones per year) and in those who were stone free after the procedure (from 0.67 to 0.00 stones per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Although it prevents new stone formation, medical therapy does not dissolve preexisting calcium stones.

Most stones &le;4 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. For stones larger than 4 mm in diameter, there is a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones &ge;10 mm in diameter. Proximal ureteral stones are also less likely to pass spontaneously. The data supporting these conclusions are presented elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ureteroscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock wave lithotripsy can be used to treat many renal calculi, but is not the ideal modality for the management of complex calculi, large or hard calculi, stones located in a calyceal diverticulum, or in patients with complex renal anatomy. Shock wave lithotripsy employs high energy shock waves produced by an electrical discharge or piezoelectric crystals, fragmenting the stone. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Shock wave lithotripsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy, for both prevention of new stone formation and facilitation of stone passage, should be considered in patients who undergo stone removal procedures. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of new stone formation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Facilitation of stone passage'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Preminger GM, Clayman RV, Hardeman SW, et al.
