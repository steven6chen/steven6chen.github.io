The severity and characteristics of hepatic injury depend upon the blood vessels that are involved and the degree to which injury is related to passive congestion or diminished perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>There are several well-recognized forms of vascular injury to the liver, including Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, passive congestion due to heart failure, hepatic infarction, and ischemic hepatitis. Congestive hepatopathy refers to hepatic manifestations attributable to passive hepatic congestion, as occurs in patients with right-sided heart failure. Passive congestion often coexists with reduced cardiac output, making their relative contributions to hepatic injury intertwined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-liver-injury-in-circulatory-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of liver injury in circulatory failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will focus on passive congestion with a brief discussion of constrictive pericarditis, while discussions on Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, ischemic hepatitis, and hepatic infarction are presented separately. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Budd-Chiari syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hepatic-sinusoidal-obstruction-syndrome-veno-occlusive-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-hepatitis-hepatic-infarction-and-ischemic-cholangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic hepatitis, hepatic infarction, and ischemic cholangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009797030\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any cause of right-sided heart failure can result in hepatic congestion, including constrictive pericarditis, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, cor pulmonale, and cardiomyopathy. Tricuspid regurgitation in particular can be associated with severe hepatic congestion because of the transmission of right ventricular pressure directly into the hepatic veins. Liver dysfunction and passive congestion are common in patients with congenital heart disease and single-ventricle physiology who have undergone the Fontan procedure, which directs systemic venous return to the pulmonary artery with bypass of the right ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2505781497\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515801466\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hepatic congestion are usually asymptomatic. In such patients, hepatic congestion may be suggested only by abnormal liver biochemical tests during routine evaluation.</p><p>Symptomatic patients may present with jaundice, which may be mistaken for biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with acute cardiac decompensation may have jaundice and a significant increase in serum aminotransferases, simulating acute viral hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Right upper quadrant discomfort (due to stretching of the liver capsule) and ascites may also be present.</p><p>Several cases of fulminant hepatic failure with coma, some resulting in death, have been reported in patients with congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/5,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-10</a>]. Most have been in the setting of superimposed shock and hepatic ischemia (ischemic hepatitis) rather than passive congestion alone. The term &quot;acute cardiogenic liver injury&quot; has been used when ischemic hepatitis occurs in the setting of congestive hepatopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333249587\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of physical findings may be present depending in part upon the severity of the congestion and its chronicity. In addition to jaundice, patients may have hepatomegaly, which can be massive (normal liver span on physical examination as measured by the liver dullness is 10 to 12 cm for men and 8 to 11 cm for women; by ultrasound, a normal liver is typically less than 16 cm in the midclavicular line). The liver edge in congestive hepatopathy is typically firm, smooth, and somewhat tender. Splenomegaly is uncommon, but like cardiac ascites, is attributable to transmitted central venous hypertension rather than liver disease.</p><p>Hepatojugular reflux is generally present and is useful in differentiating hepatic congestion from either primary intrahepatic liver disease or Budd-Chiari syndrome. In patients with significant tricuspid regurgitation, the liver may be pulsatile, with palpable presystolic pulsations corresponding to prominent &quot;v waves&quot; on a right atrial pressure tracing. A loss of hepatic pulsatility in a patient with long-standing congestive hepatopathy suggests progression to cardiac cirrhosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1563988249\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common liver biochemical abnormality is a mild elevation in the serum bilirubin level, which occurs in up to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The total serum bilirubin is usually less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> most of which is unconjugated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Patients with severe, usually acute, right-sided heart failure can develop striking hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The total serum bilirubin level was a predictor of mortality and morbidity in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The precise cause of the hyperbilirubinemia is uncertain. Contributing factors may include hepatocellular dysfunction, hemolysis, pulmonary infarction, canalicular obstruction due to distended hepatic veins, medications, and superimposed sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Serum bilirubin levels correlate with right atrial pressures but not with the cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Other liver biochemical tests are usually only mildly increased. The serum alkaline phosphatase level is usually normal or only minimally elevated even in the presence of jaundice, helping distinguish jaundice due to congestion from biliary obstruction. Serum aminotransferase levels are elevated in about one-third of patients, but typically no more than two to three times the upper limit of normal. Occasional patients have higher levels, probably because of coexisting ischemic hepatitis due to decreased cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. The degree of elevation in aminotransferases in such patients correlates with the extent of zone 3 necrosis seen on liver biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Striking elevations in aminotransferases (exceeding 1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> or 50 times the upper limit of normal) may be seen in patients with hypotension due to heart failure and may cause diagnostic confusion with viral hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Serum albumin levels are decreased in 30 to 50 percent of patients, but are rarely less than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. The degree of hypoalbuminemia does not correlate with the degree of histologic liver damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but is an independent predictor of death in patients with acute or chronic heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hypoalbuminemia is more likely to be caused by malnutrition and protein-losing gastroenteropathy due to increased intestinal lymphatic pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-losing-gastroenteropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein-losing gastroenteropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prothrombin time is mildly abnormal in many patients. The cause is incompletely understood. It may in part be due to impaired hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors II, V, VII, IX, and X. However, the prothrombin time may not correct completely with administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a>, suggesting that other coagulation defects (such as disseminated intravascular coagulation) may also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Serum ammonia levels may occasionally be elevated. Even more rarely, patients may have hepatic encephalopathy in the absence of any other evidence of liver dysfunction. The mechanism leading to hyperammonemia in heart failure is unknown, but in most cases it appears to be related to heart failure itself rather than to liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic congestion should be suspected in patients with the above clinical and laboratory features in the setting of congestive heart failure or other cardiac condition associated with elevated central venous pressure. Other causes of liver dysfunction should also be considered, including biliary obstruction, acute or chronic viral hepatitis, hepatic infiltrative disorders, and drug or herbal medication toxicity, depending upon the clinical setting.</p><p>In addition to a careful history (ie, risk factors for liver disease and medications that might contribute to hepatic injury) and a physical examination, a reasonable evaluation might include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory testing </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Serologic testing for viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease (especially in a young person), autoimmune hepatitis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, celiac disease, and thyroid dysfunction can be obtained. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study, a markedly elevated serum N-terminal-proBNP level distinguished ascites due to heart failure from ascites due to cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another study, a serum BNP level &gt;364 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> had a sensitivity of 98 percent for heart failure-related ascites, and a level &lt;182 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> excluded heart failure-related ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with ascites&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging </strong>&ndash; Imaging studies include right upper quadrant ultrasonography with Doppler studies of the portal and hepatic veins and hepatic artery, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. Characteristic findings on conventional imaging studies include dilatation of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, retrograde hepatic venous opacification shortly after intravenous contrast injection, and heterogeneous hepatic enhancement due to stagnant blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other imaging approaches to identify hepatic congestion and assess fibrosis, including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance elastography, are under study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnostic paracentesis </strong>&ndash; Patients with ascites should undergo a diagnostic paracentesis, which typically reveals a high ascitic protein content, usually greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> reflecting the relatively well-preserved serum albumin levels and the contribution of &quot;hepatic lymph&quot; to the ascites. The increased protein is presumed to be due to the rupture of hepatic lymphatics, which are rich in protein. The serum-to-ascites albumin gradient is &ge;1.1, reflecting portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p>Improvement in liver biochemical tests with treatment of the underlying cardiac condition provides support for the diagnosis. A liver biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis in equivocal cases (particularly in patients with coexisting liver disease) and establish the severity of histologic injury, but it is rarely required. Before considering a percutaneous liver biopsy, careful attention should be given to coagulation parameters, and a percutaneous biopsy should not be performed in patients with ascites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;nutmeg liver&quot; has been used classically to describe the gross appearance of a congested liver. This description reflects reddish central areas (representing sinusoidal congestion and bleeding into atrophic regions surrounding enlarged hepatic veins) with contrasting yellowish areas that represent either normal liver tissue or fatty liver. The liver tends to be enlarged with a purple hue and prominent hepatic veins.</p><p>Microscopic examination shows sinusoidal engorgement, hepatocyte atrophy, and variable degrees of hemorrhagic necrosis in zone 3 of the hepatic acinus, fatty change, and variable degrees of cholestasis with occasional bile thrombi in the canaliculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Bile thrombi are more commonly seen in patients with severe jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In patients with chronic or recurrent heart failure, reticulin and collagen accumulate in zone 3, eventually causing fibrous bands to extend outward from the central veins, occasionally linking with portal tracts to produce a lesion called cardiac sclerosis that resembles micronodular cirrhosis. Progressive fibrosis may lead to bridging between adjacent hepatic venules, producing rings of fibrosis around the spared portal regions that characterizes &quot;cardiac cirrhosis&quot; (or, more accurately, cardiac fibrosis). The histologic pattern is distinct from other forms of cirrhosis where fibrous bands tend to link adjacent portal areas. The presence of portal fibrosis in the setting of congestive hepatopathy correlates with high right atrial pressure, right atrial dilation, and right ventricular dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Fibrosis can also involve terminal hepatic venules, causing phlebosclerosis. The regeneration of periportal hepatocytes may result in discrete nodules, producing a pattern known as focal nodular hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-nodular-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal nodular hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cornerstone of management for congestive hepatopathy is treatment of the underlying heart disease. Hepatic congestion and its clinical features, including jaundice and ascites, may respond dramatically to diuretics. Care should be given to avoid excess diuresis, which could impair hepatic perfusion and precipitate zone 3 necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of paramount importance is maintenance of cardiac output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, patients may have an underlying coagulopathy, making them particularly sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation. Therefore, coagulation status should be monitored closely if warfarin anticoagulation is being considered. Similar concerns relate to other drugs that require hepatic metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis in patients with congestive hepatopathy is predicted mostly by the severity of the underlying heart disease. Liver disease rarely contributes significantly to morbidity or mortality.</p><p>Early histologic changes associated with passive congestion may resolve with medical therapy to treat the underlying cardiac condition. By contrast, prolonged hepatic congestion over months to years can lead to cirrhosis. Most of these patients have either constrictive pericarditis or mitral valve disease and secondary tricuspid regurgitation.</p><p>The presence of cirrhosis does not necessarily signal a poor prognosis. Such patients uncommonly develop serious sequelae of chronic liver disease such as variceal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/14,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,28</a>]. However, preliminary data suggest that a higher score on a noninvasive measure of liver stiffness (ie, Fibrosis-4 index), which reflects liver fibrosis, is associated with higher rate of all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests#H59530487\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Overview of serologic and radiographic tests&quot;, section on 'Indirect markers of fibrosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constrictive pericarditis is associated with clinical and pathologic changes in the liver similar to those seen in the Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Hepatic vein pressures are generally higher than those seen in patients with right-sided heart failure, making patients with constrictive pericarditis relatively more likely to develop hepatic necrosis and ultimately cirrhosis.</p><p>Patients with pericardial constriction may present with two types of complaints: those related to fluid overload, ranging from peripheral edema to anasarca; and those related to diminished cardiac output in response to exertion, such as fatigability and dyspnea on exertion. Constriction should be considered in any patient with an unexplained elevation in jugular venous pressure, particularly if there is a history of a predisposing condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hepatomegaly, a pulsatile liver, massive ascites, and peripheral edema are common. By contrast, jaundice is characteristically absent for unclear reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congestive-hepatopathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The clinical features described are relatively nonspecific, making it easy to mistake the underlying cause for primary hepatic cirrhosis or Budd-Chiari syndrome. Thus, a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis must be maintained. Important clues include elevated jugular venous pressure, Kussmaul's sign (a rise in the jugular venous pressure on inspiration), a pericardial knock, and pericardial calcification on chest radiograph. A correct diagnosis is critical since pericardiectomy is curative if performed early.
