Only a few days later, a separate report appeared of an almost identical virus detected in a second patient with acute respiratory syndrome and acute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Many subsequent cases and clusters of infections have been reported, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H15168486\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>This novel coronavirus, initially termed human coronavirus-EMC (for Erasmus Medical Center), has been named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Updated information about MERS-CoV can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/&amp;token=ggn9yyW/PO1bhSWi4ovt9uKartM+4aQx9vDq5Mzw3FcWoQgf5ZMGYieSkPpdPk3JPBtV4wwJLfV0kpQsgsCDGw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=89705\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Health Organization website</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsX5Ptv2cRVLRLymlbY85ZNQ7X5axMXkb/w8fh2ohquGNFQYSC5SxOJiLg8WWouDQmQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=89705\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website</a>.</p><p>The virology and epidemiology of MERS-CoV are discussed here.

(See <a href=\"#H619339\" class=\"local\">'Bats'</a> below.)</p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26), which is present on the surfaces of human nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells, is a functional receptor for MERS-CoV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Expression of human and bat DPP4 in nonsusceptible cells enables infection by MERS-CoV. The DPP4 protein displays high amino acid sequence conservation across different species, including the sequence that was obtained from bat cells. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) is probably a coreceptor for MERS-CoV; CEACAN5 facilitates MERS-CoV cell entry and infection when DPP4 is present by augmenting the attachment of the virus to the host cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In a cell-line susceptibility study, MERS-CoV infected several human cell lines, including lower (but not upper) respiratory, kidney, intestinal, and liver cells as well as histiocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The range of tissue tropism in vitro was broader than that for any other known human coronavirus. In another study, human bronchial epithelial cells were susceptible to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. MERS-CoV can also infect nonhuman primate, porcine, bat, civet, rabbit, and horse cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18</a>]. Further study is necessary to determine whether these in vitro findings will translate to broader species susceptibility during in vivo infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Because of a large increase in cases in Saudi Arabia in the spring of 2014, there was concern that MERS-CoV might have mutated to become more transmissible or virulent. However, cell culture experiments of viruses isolated during these outbreaks showed no evidence of changes in viral replication rate, immune escape, interferon sensitivity, or serum neutralization kinetics compared with a contemporaneous but phylogenetically different virus recovered in Riyadh or the original MERS-CoV isolate from 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175982217\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an analysis of the full or partial genomes of MERS-CoV obtained from 21 patients with MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and June 2013, there was sufficient heterogeneity to support multiple separate animal-to-human transfers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Moreover, even within a hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, there was evidence of more than one virus introduction. By estimating the evolutionary rate of the virus, the authors concluded that MERS-CoV emerged around July 2011 (95 percent highest posterior density July 2007 to June 2012).</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis during the spring of 2014 showed that viruses from patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were genetically similar, suggesting that the outbreak in Jeddah was caused by human-to-human transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Of 168 specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV during the outbreak in Jeddah, 49 percent came from a single hospital, King Fahd Hospital. Isolates from patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the spring of 2014 belonged to six different clades, suggesting that these infections resulted from increased zoonotic activity or transmission from humans in other regions. One cluster of infections observed in a single hospital in Riyadh was associated with a single clade, suggesting nosocomial transmission. Viruses representing three major genetic clades were examined for their serologic differences by plaque-reduction neutralization and were found to be essentially indistinguishable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. An analysis of sequences in MERS-CoV cases during the first half of 2015 reinforced the idea that epidemiologically separate outbreaks (in time <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> place) tend to be caused by viruses of fairly uniform, but distinctive, genetic sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2436011773\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is not well understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2163431893\"><span class=\"h2\">Virus shedding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virus is found most easily in lower respiratory tract samples (tracheal aspirates, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) of symptomatic patients, and this shedding may persist for several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Virus shedding studies indicate that the RNA concentrations found in secretions from the lower respiratory tract are at least two orders of magnitude higher than those in upper tract secretions, serum, or stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Viral RNA loads in lower respiratory tract secretions decrease slowly over time, but shedding has commonly persisted for three or more weeks. The magnitude and duration of respiratory tract viral RNA concentrations appear to correlate with severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Prolonged shedding has also been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in an asymptomatic healthcare worker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The individual was initially tested following occupational exposure to MERS-CoV. Serial PCR testing showed ongoing shedding for six weeks. These findings raise concerns that asymptomatic individuals could transmit infection to others.</p><p>In another report, two patients had positive MERS-CoV PCR results for at least one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In one patient who died from refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in pharyngeal and tracheal swabs as well as blood and urine samples until the 30<sup>th</sup> day of illness. The second patient had multisystem organ failure but recovered; MERS-CoV RNA was detected from tracheal aspirates until the 33<sup>rd</sup> day of illness.</p><p>For reasons probably related to the scarcity of biosafety level 3 facilities, almost all studies of viral shedding have depended on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), rather than virus isolation, for detection of the MERS coronavirus. The relationship between RNA detected by PCR and infectious virus, however, is not clear. In a study from South Korea, respiratory samples from four immunocompetent patients with severe MERS-CoV pneumonia, as well as samples from environmental surfaces in their hospital rooms, were examined for MERS coronavirus by both PCR and culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Virus was cultured from the respiratory tracts of three of the four enrolled patients 18 to 25 days after symptom onset. In addition, virus was successfully cultured from several environmental samples, including those from bed sheets, an intravenous fluid hanger, bedrail, an anteroom table, and a radiography device. Moreover, viral RNA was detected from environmental surfaces up to five days following the last positive PCR from patients' respiratory specimens. PCR was far more sensitive for RNA detection than culture was for virus detection in environmental samples (30 versus 6 positive tests in 148 samples, respectively; all tested by both methods).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2793621242\"><span class=\"h2\">Viremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, in which viremia is present in about 80 percent of patients at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], viremia was found in only 7 of 21 MERS-CoV&ndash;infected patients (33 percent) in plasma samples obtained at or soon after diagnosis and tested by PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Detectable viremia has also been associated with more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2449192183\"><span class=\"h2\">Receptor distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of lower respiratory tract samples in establishing the diagnosis of MERS was recognized early in the epidemic. This may be explained by the observation that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor, is expressed in the upper respiratory tract epithelium of camels, but in humans it is expressed only in the lower respiratory tract but not in the upper respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This may also be a reason that the limited human-to-human transmission has been observed to date. (See <a href=\"#H62935325\" class=\"local\">'Human-to-human transmission'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514203588\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been few reports of autopsies or biopsies from MERS patients. The one reported autopsy, performed in a man who died of respiratory and renal failure 12 days after symptom onset, showed diffuse alveolar damage and abundant viral antigen in pneumocytes and epithelial cells of the lung but no detectable virus antigen in the kidneys or other organs, including the brain and liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. There has been one reported renal biopsy in a man with MERS-CoV infection and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The biopsy was obtained eight weeks after disease onset, and virus was not detected in the kidney tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4032900412\"><span class=\"h2\">Animal models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several animal models have been developed. Mice, ferrets, and guinea pigs do not appear to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, mice in which the human DPP4 receptor had been introduced using transgene vectors developed severe fatal infection, with recovery of virus in high titer from the lungs and brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Rabbits, in contrast, are naturally susceptible to MERS-CoV infection; however, following inoculation with MERS-CoV, they shed virus from the lungs but have minimal histopathologic changes or clinical signs of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Several studies have shown that nonhuman primates can be successfully used as animal models for MERS-CoV infection and disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. In one study, six rhesus macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV through a combination of intratracheal, intranasal, oral, and ocular routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Within 24 hours, all animals developed anorexia, fever, tachypnea, cough, piloerection, and hunched posture. Chest radiographs showed localized pulmonary infiltrates and increased interstitial markings. After the animals were euthanized, postmortem examinations showed multifocal to coalescent lesions throughout the lungs. Histopathology demonstrated infiltrates of neutrophils and macrophages, compatible with acute interstitial pneumonia.</p><p>In another study by the same group, following inoculation with MERS-CoV, rhesus macaques developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Clinical signs, virus shedding, virus replication in respiratory tissues, gene expression, inflammatory changes on histology, and cytokine and chemokine profiles peaked one day after infection and decreased rapidly over time. In nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, viral loads were also highest on day 1 postinfection and decreased rapidly. Two of three animals were still shedding virus from the respiratory tract on day 6 (the same day they were euthanized). MERS-CoV caused a multifocal, mild to marked interstitial pneumonia, with virus replication occurring primarily in type I and II alveolar pneumocytes.</p><p>Marmosets infected with MERS-CoV develop more severe pneumonia than rhesus macaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Pulmonary infectious virus titers were three logs higher in marmosets than macaques, and neutrophil infiltrations were measurably more dense.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15168486\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In September 2012, a novel coronavirus infection was reported in ProMed Mail, an internet-based reporting system that helps disseminate information about infectious disease outbreaks worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The virus was isolated from the sputum of a man in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who was admitted to a hospital with pneumonia and acute kidney injury in June 2012. Shortly thereafter, a report appeared of an almost identical virus detected in a patient in Qatar with acute respiratory syndrome and acute kidney injury; the patient had traveled recently to Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Subsequent cases and clusters of infections have been reported, as discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F95981\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95981 \">figure 1</a>).

The median age is 48 years (range 9 months to 94 years), and 64 percent of cases have been male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The number of cases in the Middle East increased dramatically in March and April 2014 then declined sharply in mid-May 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. A smaller increase in cases occurred during March and April 2013.

Many additional cases and clusters of MERS-CoV infections have been detected subsequently in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F95981\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95981 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89703 \">figure 2</a>). Cases have also been reported from other regions, including North Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102411 \">table 1</a>). In countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula, patients developed illness after returning from the Arabian Peninsula or through close contact with infected individuals. (See <a href=\"#H29750411\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15168486\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MERS-CoV is a lineage C betacoronavirus found in humans and camels that is different from the other human betacoronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, OC43, and HKU1) but closely related to several bat coronaviruses. (See <a href=\"#H29749131\" class=\"local\">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of the full or partial genomes of MERS-CoV obtained from 21 patients with MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and June 2013, there was sufficient heterogeneity to support multiple separate animal-to-human transfers. Moreover, even within a single hospital outbreak, there was evidence of more than one virus introduction. (See <a href=\"#H175982217\" class=\"local\">'Genetic analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of cases in the Arabian Peninsula increased dramatically in March and April 2014 then declined sharply in ensuing months. However, cases continue to be detected. A large outbreak occurred in South Korea from May until early July 2015; the index case was an individual who had traveled to the Arabian Peninsula. Another large outbreak began in a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in the summer of 2015. (See <a href=\"#H29750411\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15168486\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MERS-CoV is closely related to coronaviruses found in bats, suggesting that bats may be a reservoir of MERS-CoV. Camels likely serve as hosts for MERS-CoV. (See <a href=\"#H366154201\" class=\"local\">'Possible sources and modes of transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Case clusters in the United Kingdom, Tunisia, and Italy and in healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia, France, Iran, and South Korea strongly suggest that human-to-human transmission occurs. The number of contacts infected by individuals with confirmed infections, however, appears to be limited. (See <a href=\"#H62935325\" class=\"local\">'Human-to-human transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional information about MERS-CoV can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/&amp;token=ggn9yyW/PO1bhSWi4ovt9uKartM+4aQx9vDq5Mzw3FcWoQgf5ZMGYieSkPpdPk3JPBtV4wwJLfV0kpQsgsCDGw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=89705\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Health Organization's website</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsX5Ptv2cRVLRLymlbY85ZNQ7X5axMXkb/w8fh2ohquGNFQYSC5SxOJiLg8WWouDQmQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=89705\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website</a>.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">ProMed Mail: Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate; Archive Number: 20120920.1302733 http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20120920.1302733 (Accessed on April 22, 2013).</li><li class=\"breakAll\">World Health Organization.
