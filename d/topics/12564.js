Depending upon the clinical stage, size, and location of the primary tumor, a rectal cancer can be treated with either local or radical excision. A local excision is usually performed transanally. A radical excision is performed transabdominally with either a sphincter-sparing procedure or an abdominal perineal resection. Rectal cancers that have invaded adjacent organs may require a multivisceral resection.</p><p>In this topic, we review various surgical techniques that are used to treat rectal cancer. A stepwise approach to selecting the appropriate surgical technique is outlined in an algorithm and described in another topic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108222\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108222 \">algorithm 1</a>).

However, such patients can expect to have more recurrences because adjuvant therapy is not as effective in clearing micrometastasis in the mesorectum or residual disease in the excision bed. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 19 observational (including two comparative) studies, local excision followed by adjuvant chemoradiation therapy was associated with higher local recurrence rates than local excision followed by TME for pT1 (10 versus 6 percent), pT2 (15 versus 10 percent), and pooled pT1-2 rectal cancer (14 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rectal-cancer-surgical-techniques/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Also, a rectal protocol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan should be performed prior to surgery to confirm that the outer border of the internal sphincter and the muscularis propria are clear of cancer. </p><p>ISR extends the surgical margin further distally by separating the internal and external anal sphincters and removing the internal sphincter partially or completely. Anatomically, the internal anal sphincter is the continuation of the muscular layer of the rectum. Following a proctectomy with total mesorectal excision and ISR, intestinal continuity is restored with a coloanal anastomosis (with a colonic J pouch, whenever feasible).

Those undergoing a colorectal anastomosis are less likely to have problems because they typically have sufficient rectal reserve. Patients undergoing coloanal anastomosis, however, often complain of frequent or fragmented stool pattern for at least one year postoperatively. Several techniques of coloanal anastomosis have been developed to improve their postsurgical bowel function, including colonic J-pouch reservoir, side-to-end anastomosis, and transverse coloplasty.
