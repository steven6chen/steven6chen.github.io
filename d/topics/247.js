It is also referred to as ascending cholangitis. Cholangitis was first described by Charcot as a serious and life-threatening illness; however, it is now recognized that the severity can range from mild to life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of acute cholangitis. The approach to patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, the management of common bile duct stones, and the endoscopic management of malignant biliary obstructions are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-bile-duct-stones-standard-techniques-and-mechanical-lithotripsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of bile duct stones: Standard techniques and mechanical lithotripsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cholangitis is caused primarily by bacterial infection in a patient with biliary obstruction. The organisms typically ascend from the duodenum; hematogenous spread from the portal vein is a rare source of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The most important predisposing factor for acute cholangitis is biliary obstruction and stasis. The most common causes of biliary obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis without bile duct stents are biliary calculi (28 to 70 percent), benign stenosis (5 to 28 percent), and malignancy (10 to 57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, acute cholangitis is a common complication of stent placement for malignant biliary obstruction (18 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of bacterial entry into the biliary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteria are able to enter the biliary tract when the normal barrier mechanisms are disrupted. This may result in translocation of bacteria from the portal system or duodenum into the biliary tree.</p><p>Normal barrier mechanisms include the sphincter of Oddi, which normally forms an effective mechanical barrier to duodenal reflux and ascending bacterial infection. In addition, continuous flushing action of bile plus the bacteriostatic activity of bile salts helps maintain bile sterility. Secretory IgA and biliary mucous probably function as anti-adherence factors, preventing bacterial colonization.</p><p>Biliary obstruction raises intrabiliary pressure and leads to increased permeability of bile ductules, permitting translocation of bacteria and toxins from the portal circulation into the biliary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Elevated pressure also favors migration of bacteria from bile into the systemic circulation, increasing the risk of septicemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, increased biliary pressure adversely affects a number of host defense mechanisms including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kupffer cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA production</p><p/><p>Duodenal bacteria are able to enter the biliary system in high concentrations when the barrier mechanism is disrupted, as occurs after endoscopic sphincterotomy, choledochal surgery, or biliary stent insertion. Acute cholangitis frequently develops after endoscopic or percutaneous manipulation with incomplete biliary drainage or as a late complication of biliary stent blockage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) septic complications&quot;, section on 'Ascending cholangitis'</a>.)</p><p>However, bacteria can also pass spontaneously through the sphincter of Oddi in small numbers. The presence of a foreign body, such as a stone or stent, can then act as a nidus for bacterial colonization. Bile taken from patients without obstruction is sterile or nearly sterile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By comparison, approximately 70 percent of all patients with gallstones have evidence of bacteria in the bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Patients with common bile duct stones have a higher probability of bile culture positivity than those with gallstones in the gallbladder or cystic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Bacteria can also be cultured from gallstones. In one study, for example, 80 percent of brown pigment stones were culture positive, and 84 percent showed scanning electron microscopic evidence of bacterial structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The organisms recovered in culture were typical of those seen in cholangitis (enterococci, 40 percent; <em>Escherichia coli</em>, 17 percent; <em>Klebsiella</em> spp, 10 percent), although the ratio of enterococci and <em>E. coli</em> was inverted from that usually found in infected bile.</p><p>Some features of bacteria that may enhance pathogenicity in this setting include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External pili in gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, which facilitate attachment to foreign surfaces, such as a stone or stent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A glycocalyx matrix composed of exopolysaccharides produced by bacteria that protect the organisms from host defense mechanisms and may hinder penetration of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteriology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture of bile, ductal stones, and blocked biliary stents are positive in over 90 percent of cases of acute cholangitis, yielding a mixed growth of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The most common bacteria isolated are of colonic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>E. coli</em> is the major gram-negative bacterium isolated (25 to 50 percent), followed by <em>Klebsiella</em> (15 to 20 percent) and <em>Enterobacter</em> species (5 to 10 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common gram-positive bacteria are <em>Enterococcus</em> species (10 to 20 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaerobes, such as <em>Bacteroides</em> and Clostridia, are usually present as part of a mixed infection. They are rarely the sole infecting organisms, and it is not clear if they play a role in acute cholangitis. Recovery of anaerobes appears to be more common after repeated infections or surgery on the biliary tree. The frequency of anaerobic infection is underestimated by standard culture techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic presentation of acute cholangitis is fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice (Charcot's triad), though only 50 to 75 percent of patients with acute cholangitis have all three findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Confusion and hypotension can occur in patients with suppurative cholangitis, producing Reynolds pentad, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If septic shock develops, multiorgan failure may be seen. Hypotension may be the only presenting symptom in elderly patients or those on glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250943896\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of acute cholangitis are fever and abdominal pain, which are seen in approximately 80 percent of patients. Jaundice is less common and is seen in 60 to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with severe (suppurative) cholangitis may present with fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, hypotension, and mental status changes (Reynolds pentad). Older adults and patients receiving glucocorticoids may have atypical presentations (such as hypotension alone), which may lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory tests typically reveal an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance, and a cholestatic pattern of liver test abnormalities, with elevations in the serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and bilirubin (predominantly conjugated) concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, a pattern of acute hepatocyte necrosis can be seen in which the aminotransferases may be as high as 2000 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This pattern reflects microabscess formation in the liver. Liver biopsy in such cases shows neutrophils in the cholangioles with small abscesses and associated hepatocyte necrosis.</p><p>Serum amylase can be increased to three to four times normal, suggesting associated pancreatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic criteria (the 2013 Tokyo guidelines) have been proposed for acute cholangitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis should be <strong>suspected</strong> if a patient has one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shaking chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evidence of an inflammatory response (abnormal white blood cell count, increased serum C-reactive protein, or other changes suggestive of inflammation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>and</strong> one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal liver chemistries (elevated alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase)</p><p/><p>The diagnosis is considered <strong>definite</strong> if, in addition to meeting the criteria for a suspected diagnosis, the patient also has:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary dilation on imaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of an etiology on imaging (eg, a stricture, stone, or stent)</p><p/><p>Blood cultures should be performed in all patients in whom cholangitis is suspected to help direct antibiotic therapy. Cultures should also be obtained from bile or stents removed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>In patients with Charcot's triad and abnormal liver tests, we proceed directly to ERCP to confirm the diagnosis and provide biliary drainage since immediate drainage is a life saving procedure. In patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute cholangitis, but without Charcot's triad, we recommend transabdominal ultrasonography to look for common bile duct dilatation or stones. If the ultrasound shows ductal dilation or stones, it should be followed promptly (within 24 hours) by ERCP to provide biliary drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70088\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70088 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67640\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67640 \">picture 1</a>). If the etiology of the obstruction remains unclear after ERCP, then cross sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-bile-duct-stones-standard-techniques-and-mechanical-lithotripsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of bile duct stones: Standard techniques and mechanical lithotripsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transabdominal ultrasonography may be negative when only small stones are present in the bile ducts (which occurs in 10 to 20 percent of cases) or with acute obstruction when the bile duct has not yet had time to dilate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62967\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62967 \">image 2</a>). If the transabdominal ultrasound is normal (ie, patients with suspected acute cholangitis), we proceed with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to look for bile duct stones or alternative diagnoses that may have been missed on transabdominal ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57884\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57884 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. For most patients who cannot undergo MRCP (eg, patients with implanted cardiac devices), we will proceed with ERCP if the liver tests are suggestive of biliary obstruction. If the liver tests are normal or if the patient is pregnant or at high risk for complications from ERCP, we will proceed with endoscopic ultrasound to look for evidence of bile duct stones or obstruction. If this subsequent testing fails to demonstrate biliary obstruction, an evaluation for alternative explanations for the patient's symptoms should be performed.

This procedure permits active decompression of the common bile duct by aspiration, and provides a route for irrigation of the biliary system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, the catheters can become dislodged, particularly in elderly or confused patients. </p><p>Placing a stent within the bile duct without first performing a sphincterotomy appears to permit adequate drainage and may be another option for patients with coagulopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59873235\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) can be considered when ERCP is unavailable, unsuccessful, or contraindicated. PTC involves transhepatic insertion of a needle into a bile duct, followed by injection of contrast material to opacify the bile ducts. PTC permits a number of therapeutic interventions, including drainage of infected bile, extraction of biliary tract stones, dilation of benign biliary strictures, or placement of a stent across a malignant stricture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another alternative to ERCP for biliary drainage is placement of a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube in patients with an intact gallbladder. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency surgery for acute cholangitis has largely been replaced by nonoperative biliary drainage. Once the acute cholangitis is controlled, patients with difficult ductal stones may undergo surgical exploration of the common bile duct for stone removal. Elective surgery carries a very low morbidity and mortality compared with emergency surgery. If emergent surgery is needed due to failure of a nonsurgical drainage procedure, choledochotomy with placement of a large-bore T tube has a lower mortality than cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholangitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In addition, fetal shielding should be used during ERCP and fluoroscopy time should be minimized.
