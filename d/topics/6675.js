According to the Framingham population study of older adults, approximately 19 percent of men and 25 percent of women have significant foot pain on most days of the week that often limits their ability to function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The authors of this study recommend that clinicians include a foot examination as part of their routine evaluation of older patients. However, many clinicians may not be adequately prepared to perform such an examination as their training in the diagnosis and care of foot problems is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the common causes of foot pain in adult patients, including the frequency of problems in specific populations. Conditions are organized by location, including the forefoot, midfoot, and rear foot. Examination focuses on visual inspection of the foot. The appearance of many common foot conditions can lead the clinician to the correct diagnosis. A detailed approach to the diagnosis of forefoot pain is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of forefoot pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13378200\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain populations appear to be at increased risk of developing foot pain. These include: older adults, the obese, active adults who participate in sports that involve running and jumping, active military personnel, and those engaged in certain occupations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>In a multiethnic sample of 784 community dwelling adults older than 65 years, 30.9 percent had tenderness to palpation of the foot. In addition, minor foot disorders affected the majority of individuals, including toenail disorders (74.9 percent), minor toe deformities (60 percent), corns and calluses (58.2 percent), and bunions (37.1 percent). Skin problems, including fungal infection, cracking, maceration between toes, and minor cuts, affected greater than one-third of individuals. Gender differences were noted, with women having greater problems with bunions, corns, and calluses. In addition, racial and ethnic differences were noted for flat feet, corns and calluses, toe disorders, and other physical findings, although additional studies would be needed to clarify these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Several studies document a significant burden of disability and impaired quality of life among middle aged and older adults with foot pain. In a meta-analysis of 31 studies including 75,505 participants, 24 percent experienced frequent foot pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Forefoot pain was most common and women appeared affected more frequently than men. In affected individuals, two-thirds reported moderate disability secondary to this pain. In an older cohort of 301 community-dwelling patients aged 70 to 95 years, 36 percent reported disabling foot pain; foot pain had a strong association with depression and low well-being scores on a standardized symptom inventory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Athletes in a number of sports frequently develop foot pain. Among competitive gymnasts, the foot is the most commonly injured area, accounting for 21 percent of all injuries. According to a survey study of 96 club gymnasts, 16.7 percent experienced a stress fracture during a single season, with low back and foot fractures accounting for the majority of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In professional rugby, foot injuries are not as common but lead to substantial loss of playing time. According to a four-year surveillance study, each foot injury lead to an average of 24 days of lost playing time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While 73 percent of injuries are acute, chronic foot conditions such as stress fractures (particularly those of the navicular bone) led to disproportionately greater time lost. In American football, 72 percent of elite collegiate players have experienced a foot or ankle injury, with turf toe and metatarsophalangeal joint dislocation being the third most common of all injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among dancers, ballet performers have the highest injury rates, with foot and ankle problems accounting for 29 percent of injuries in one study of 500 dancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13378206\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406361780\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic foot anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic anatomy of the foot is discussed separately; additional information about foot anatomy and biomechanics related to common foot injuries is provided below.

Foot shape ranges from short and broad to long and thin, with marked variation in the curvature of the axis from the rear foot to the forefoot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97769 \">figure 14</a>). Longitudinal arch height can be extremely elevated, as in the cavus foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98817 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F82600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82600 \">picture 2</a>), or flattened to the point where no longitudinal arch exists, as in extreme forms of pes planus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98818 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77874\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77874 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p>In the longitudinal (sagittal) plane, the foot can be divided into three regions: rear foot, consisting of the talus and calcaneus; midfoot, incorporating all of the tarsal bones; and forefoot, composed of the metatarsals, phalanges, and sesamoid bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 \">figure 5</a>). In the medial-lateral (transverse) plane, the forefoot can be divided into a medial column and a lateral column. Both are stabilized at the rearfoot through their articulation with the tarsal bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71857 \">figure 4</a>). The medial column consists of rays one, two, and three, with a ray defined as the metatarsal and related phalanges. The medial column allows for force transfer during the toe-off part of gait, and the metatarsals and phalanges have greater bulk to accommodate this force. The lateral column is composed of rays four and five and serves more of a sensory function, as the terminal phase of push-off during gait typically leads to forefoot supination. Only the base of the fifth metatarsal absorbs significant weight and force transfer through the attachment of the peroneus brevis tendon and is accordingly thicker and wider than the remainder of the bone.</p><p>Accessory ossicles and the variable presence of sesamoid bones contribute to the variability of foot anatomy. Sesamoid bones can exist at the plantar surfaces of the interphalangeal (IP) of the great toe, the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint medial and lateral (hallucal sesamoids), and in the lesser MTP joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These range in frequency, from hallucal sesamoids, which are always present, to the lesser sesamoids, which are present in 0.1 to 4.3 percent of cases (2 to 13 percent of these exist at the first IP joint). Nine accessory ossicles develop in one of three anatomical areas of the foot. The most common include the os trigone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98847\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98847 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89298\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89298 \">image 2</a>), os peroneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98848\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98848 \">picture 5</a>), and os naviculare, each of which occurs in 20 to 26 percent of feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98820 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Foot structure and appearance can vary due to congenital foot conditions. Among the most common conditions are tarsal coalitions, which can manifest a number of patterns among the tarsal articulations. Extreme or rigid pes planus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98878\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98878 \">picture 6</a>) may indicate that a tarsal coalition underlies the shape and appearance of the foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Another variant that affects the structure, appearance, and function of the foot is brachymetatarsia. This condition can affect any of the metatarsals, which may be abnormally shortened, but the most common are first and fourth brachymetatarsia. Fourth brachymetatarsia occurs in 0.02 to 0.05 percent of individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98849 \">picture 7</a>), but variants of first brachymetatarsia are more common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98850\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98850 \">picture 8</a>). Brachymetatarsia predisposes to a number of pathologic conditions. First metatarsal (MT) shortening may contribute to hallux varus (the opposite subluxation from that seen with the typical bunion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98851 \">picture 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The higher frequency of brachymetatarsia among Special Olympics athletes supports the theory that genetic alterations play an important role in their development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406361786\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic foot structure and biomechanics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The foot functions as both a rigid platform for stance and to absorb the impact of landing during gait and as a flexible lever that enables push-off during walking or running (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53103\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53103 \">figure 15</a>). In addition to the distinct anatomical zones of the rear, mid, and forefoot, the foot can be divided longitudinally into the functional units of the medial (first through third rays) and lateral columns (fourth and fifth rays), as described above. </p><p>In a normal walking gait cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53103\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53103 \">figure 15</a>), individuals land on the heel with the foot in supination and Chopart's joint locked to make the foot rigid. After foot strike, the midfoot allows pronation that unlocks Chopart's joint so that individuals can push off the medial column during toe-off. The Lisfranc joint, which lies between the midfoot and forefoot, is a highly stable articulation that supports the transverse arch, while enabling forefoot motion. Stability is provided by the plantar and dorsal transmetatarsal ligaments, a recessed second tarsometatarsal joint crossed by the Lisfranc ligament, the anterior tibialis tendon insertion (which provides additional stability at the dorsal surface), and the posterior tibialis tendon insertions (which provide additional stability at the plantar surface). Thus, with the exception of the second tarsal-metatarsal articulation, the stability of the Lisfranc joint arises from ligamentous and tendon attachments, which allows for slight motion in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion and creates a spring-like action during gait. The distal articulations of the metatarsals at the MTP joints are highly mobile. Overall, this structural adaptation of a fixed midfoot, slight flexibility at the Lisfranc joint, and great flexibility at the MTP joint allows the midfoot-forefoot complex to act as a powerful lever that can overcome body weight and propel a person forward when running or upward when jumping. During the terminal phase of gait, the forefoot supinates, providing some final assistance with propulsion. The lateral column also provides proprioceptive feedback and additional cushion to the foot.</p><p>Studies of different foot types have shown that structure affects the ability of the foot to pronate correctly and follow the normal pattern of motion needed during the gait cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other studies indicate that different foot shapes influence the foot strike pattern and determine the areas of the foot that absorb the greatest impact. Cavus feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98817 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F82600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82600 \">picture 2</a>) appear to absorb greater forces during gait (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98852\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98852 \">picture 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and feet with cavus or rear foot varus structures are associated with a higher risk of running-related injury in prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, foot structure and gait patterns predict only part of the variability seen in pressure measurements, and these measurements vary at different walking and running speeds. So, while foot structure and shape likely play an important role in injury, gait mechanics play an equally important role and these two clinical parameters must be assessed together. In addition, research suggests that age may be a risk factor, as longitudinal arch height declines somewhat with age, and the frequency of forefoot injury in older patients suggests that the same phenomena occurs in the transverse arch.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13378212\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY-BASED APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596036461\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history of the patient with foot pain focuses on identifying the location of the pain and any common pain pattern suggestive of a particular condition. Important questions to ask include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pain constant or intermittent?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Constant pain suggests a more severe injury or a medical condition that mimics injury. Intermittent pain occurs in many injuries in which a particular inciting event triggers the condition. As an example, cuboid subluxation causes no pain during normal gait but elicits a sharp pain when walking on an uneven surface causes the cuboid to sublux.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How would you characterize the pain (eg, dull, sharp, burning)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute injuries to joints or tendons often cause a sharp pain. Dull pain occurs in more chronic conditions. As an example, hallux rigidus causes a chronic dull ache in the first MTP joint, whereas acute turf toe causes a sharp pain affecting the same joint. Burning pain raises suspicion for nerve involvement. A condition like tarsal tunnel often triggers burning pain to the plantar surface of the foot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there associated symptoms (eg, numbness, paresthesias)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Numbness and paresthesias in the foot often arise from either spinal cord or peripheral nerve compression; while symptoms affect the foot, the anatomical site of injury is rarely intrinsic to the foot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the pain radiate?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radiating pain suggests nerve irritation is the cause of symptoms in the foot. As an example, pain from tarsal tunnel syndrome radiates to the plantar surface of the forefoot and may be felt along the distribution of the tibial nerve. Similarly, pain from Morton neuroma radiates from the metatarsal area where the nerve is injured to the inner aspect of adjacent toes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there night time pain (ie, pain when patient is not bearing weight), or does pain occur only with weight bearing?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Stress fractures and arthritic lesions often cause pain at night. Nocturnal pain may also arise from tumors or conditions such as diabetic neuropathy. Conditions like plantar fasciitis, tendinopathy, and metatarsalgia typically do not cause night pain and usually require weight bearing to elicit symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the pain develop following a specific injury or a change in sports or work activity (eg, substantial increase in running distance)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common history for overuse injury is a change in sport or work activity that placed increased cumulative stress on the foot. The mechanism of specific acute injuries often indicates the likely diagnosis. As an example, Achilles tendinopathy causing chronic heel pain might stem from the cumulative stress of increased running mileage over a number of weeks, while heel pain from an acute tendon strain might have developed abruptly during a specific speed workout.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was there a change in shoe wear before the pain started?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Shoe wear patterns may indicate a change in running gait from weakness, progressive arch collapse, or pain. As an example, the shoes of a runner with excess rear foot pronation and calcaneal valgus might show increased wear on the medial heel and virtually no wear on the lateral edge of the heel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have any significant chronic illnesses (eg, diabetes)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many chronic illnesses cause symptoms that affect the musculoskeletal system. Diabetes in particular leads to neuropathy that affects the feet and can lead to foot injuries. Gout is another systemic disease that often affects the great and may cause swelling of the first MTP joint without the patient being aware of a specific great toe injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you had a significant gain in weight during the past year?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Weight gain affects structures in the foot that provide support during standing or gait. Plantar fasciitis often occurs after a significant increase in weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does anything relieve the pain?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, many patients with pain from a bunion (hallux valgus) or Morton neuroma get relief simply by wearing a shoe with a wider toe box.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of foot problems?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bunions in particular seem to have a relationship to inherited foot structure. The same is true of the conditions that cause brachymetatarsia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a recent pregnancy &ndash; How much weight gain came with your pregnancy? Did your shoe size change?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During pregnancy, women develop ligamentous laxity related to hormonal changes. Many experience some collapse of the longitudinal or transverse arch, particularly if they have excessive weight gain with a given pregnancy. This may trigger pain across the metatarsal region or along the longitudinal arch.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596036467\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the injured foot begins with close observation. This includes watching the patient's gait as they enter the examination room to see if there is a limp or any other sign of injury. Examine the foot without socks or shoes. Look for swelling, color change, the height and shape of the arch, and any abnormalities or asymmetries, such as abnormal callus patterns on the plantar surface, asymmetry in the forefoot width or arch height, hammering of the toes, bunions or bunionettes, splaying of the toes, or abnormally short metatarsal segments. Such findings may be missed unless the clinician observes the patient's feet while they sit and stand (ie, while weight-bearing), and looks closely at both feet from all perspectives, including the dorsal and plantar surfaces.</p><p>Palpation focuses on locating areas of tenderness or warmth, which suggests inflammation. If palpable abnormalities exist, try to ascertain whether they involve soft tissue or bone. Palpation should include both the dorsal and plantar surface. On the dorsal surface, feel for tarsometatarsal bossing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98817 \">picture 1</a>), which is associated with midfoot arthritis, ganglions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98854\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98854 \">picture 11</a>), and hypertrophy or spurring over the MTP joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98856 \">picture 12</a>). On the plantar surface, feel for callus formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98857\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98857 \">picture 13</a>), and if present determine whether the callused area is tender. Palpate the plantar location of the metatarsal heads. Metatarsal heads that have subluxed through the metatarsal capsules are palpable. If palpable, determine if they are fixed or movable. Palpate for nodules along the plantar arch, tenderness at the calcaneus, and a Haglund deformity at the heel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98858 \">picture 14</a>).

Abnormal foot strike patterns contribute to breakdown of the foot structure. During foot strike, look for calcaneal varus (heel turns inward) or valgus (heel turns outward), marked pronation or supination, and forefoot valgus (foot strike predominantly on the first MTP) or varus (foot strike over fourth and fifth MTP; first MTP often fails to make solid contact). Having the patient walk on their toes may help demonstrate the presence of hallux rigidus, as the patient cannot effectively push off (toe-off) at the end of the gait cycle if the condition is present. Toe walking can help to identify posterior tibial dysfunction, as the condition will limit calcaneal varus. Having the patient walk on their heels may help to identify an unsuspected foot drop or an arthritic tibiotalar joint that prevents dorsiflexion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-walking-and-running-gait\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of walking and running gait&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For runners, observe the patient while he or she runs both toward and away from you. The author typically observes running gait initially with the barefoot and then while the patient is wearing their running shoes to see if any degree of correction occurs. When the patient runs in shoes, ask them to start at a slower pace, but then observe them at their normal running pace. Observe whether the increase in speed creates more pronation or supination.</p><p>While the examination should look at the entire foot as well as the gait, most problems that cause foot pain affect one of three specific anatomical zones: the forefoot, midfoot, and rearfoot.

The most common location of rear foot pain is at the insertion of the plantar fascia into the medial aspect of the calcaneus, a location that suggests plantar fasciitis. Most patients with plantar fasciitis describe intense pain when they first step out of bed in the morning. Pain is severe when they begin walking or running, but gradually subsides with activity. Dull pain often persists throughout the day. Pain is relieved by sitting but grows more intense whenever they stand or walk. Night pain is not typical. Examination findings usually include tenderness at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneus. (See <a href=\"#H13378340\" class=\"local\">'Plantar fasciitis'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of other rear foot conditions is suggested by the location of pain and tenderness. Pain directly over the os calcis on the plantar surface of the heel affects a number of patients. Other parts of the calcaneus associated with pain include the insertion of the Achilles tendon, which is more likely in patients with a Haglund's deformity, and suggests distal tendinopathy or enthesopathy. Pain less commonly occurs on the lateral aspect of the calcaneus. Unusual bony prominences around the calcaneus may indicate an accessory bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98820 \">table 1</a>) or a tarsal coalition. In a series of cases, 80 of 92 tarsal coalitions involved the calcaneus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These typically present as extreme or rigid pes planus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98878\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98878 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13378346\" class=\"local\">'Achilles tendon insertion and Haglund&rsquo;s deformity'</a> below.)</p><p>Pain over the talus is less common. The anterior talus becomes tender when spurs or soft tissue changes lead to anterior impingement. Accessory bones related to the talus may become painful. Most often these are located at the anterior aspect. Pain directly over the lateral corner of the talus is often due to a talar osteochondral defect. Patients with lateral foot pain behind the malleolus who are active but do not recall an ankle sprain or specific trauma often have peroneal tendinopathy. They complain of pain with running or when changing direction abruptly during sport.

The central portion is thickest and attaches to the medial process of the tuberosity of the calcaneus. Plantar fasciitis is among the most common causes of rear foot and heel pain. Pain typically occurs at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneus. This corner of the plantar fascia is thought to undergo greater torque during gait than other areas.</p><p>A number of anatomic issues can contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis. The plantar fascia merges distally with the capsule of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. Therefore, during first MTP extension the fascia tightens and pulls on its attachment to the heel capsule. Because of the complex biomechanical role of the plantar fascia, conditions like hallux limitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or bunions that affect the flexibility and normal motion of the first MTP may interfere with plantar fascial function, making fasciitis more likely. Posteriorly, the Achilles tendon merges with the heel capsule and tightening of the heel capsule by plantar fascia traction is thought to signal the Achilles tendon to fire and initiate plantar flexion. Anatomical conditions that stress the insertion of the plantar fascia at the medial calcaneus, such as a high cavus foot or pes planus with a pronated foot, may also contribute to plantar fasciitis.</p><p>Non-anatomic factors that may predispose to plantar fasciitis include excessive weight, significant weight gain, prolonged standing (particularly on hard surfaces), and inadequate shoe support. Although many possible risk factors have been observed in plantar fasciitis, the relative risk of any individual risk factor is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Most patients with plantar fasciitis describe intense pain when they first step out of bed in the morning. Pain is severe when they begin walking or running, but gradually subsides with activity. Dull pain often persists throughout the day. Pain is relieved by sitting but grows more intense whenever they stand or walk. Night pain is not typical of plantar fasciitis and its presence suggests the need for additional diagnostic testing looking for a calcaneal stress fracture.</p><p>Examination findings typically include tenderness at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneus. Tenderness is best elicited by the examiner dorsiflexing the patient's toes with one hand in order to pull the plantar fascia taut, and then palpating with the thumb or index finger of the other hand along the fascia from the heel to the forefoot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76161 \">picture 15</a>). The plantar fascia wraps around the calcaneus in many patients so pain patterns can vary. Rarely, localized swelling near the fascial insertion may be noted.</p><p>The clinician may observe other findings that can contribute to the condition, such as loss of motion at the first MTP joint, hallux valgus deformity, cavus-type arch, and excessive foot pronation. Patients with a thin heel pad and those who have sustained local trauma may have pain directly over the prominence of the os calcis (a &quot;march&quot; or &quot;stone&quot; bruise) that can mimic plantar fasciitis. Ultrasound imaging can demonstrate some changes associated with plantar fasciitis, including fascial thickening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96849\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96849 \">image 3</a>), nodules, and partial or complete tears. The evaluation and management of plantar fasciitis is discussed in detail separately.

Most often, such pain stems from injury to the distal Achilles tendon (tendinopathy or enthesopathy) or a Haglund's deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98858 \">picture 14</a>), an exostosis that develops at the superior aspect of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity. Both conditions are most likely to develop and become painful in distance runners and athletes involved in running and jumping sports. They may also affect individuals who do a lot of walking, hiking, or stair climbing. Tenderness is located at the insertion of the Achilles tendon or directly over the exostosis with a Haglund's deformity. The clinician may note thickening at the Achilles tendon, local redness and swelling, and the prominent bump on the upper posterior calcaneus that is characteristic of the Haglund's deformity. The clinical significance of Haglund's deformity is questionable and surgical removal offers inconsistent benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The diagnosis and management of classic midportion Achilles tendinopathy is reviewed separately, but insertional Achilles tendinopathy (ie, enthesopathy) is a distinct entity and it is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Insertional Achilles tendinopathy involves Sharpey's tendon fibers that pull free from their insertion on the boney periosteum of the calcaneus. This causes an intense inflammatory response and may lead to calcification at the tendon insertion or formation of a bony exostosis. Insertional Achilles tendinopathy accounts for 20 to 25 percent of Achilles problems. Certain subgroups have greater risk and this includes running athletes who account for 53 percent of cases. Among higher level runners, the injury affects 7 to 9 percent of competitors annually. Men are at greater risk and affected in up to 89 percent of sports-related cases. Achilles tendinopathy risk increases with age and up to 75 percent of enthesopathy cases occur in older athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Some reports suggest that calcaneal varus malalignment is present in 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>].</p><p>On examination, the presence of a Haglund deformity suggests relatively high stress at the Achilles insertion. Local warmth, erythema, swelling, tendon thickness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> focal tenderness of the tendon suggest that pain arises from tendinopathy rather than the Haglund deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91862\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91862 \">picture 16</a>). If retrocalcaneal bursitis is the source of pain, squeezing the soft tissue behind the Achilles tendon and just above the superior border of the calcaneus is likely to be painful, while direct palpation of the tendon will not elicit pain. Both the tendon and bursae are easily seen on ultrasound, which can help to identify Achilles pathology. In complex cases that require a definitive diagnosis, MRI may provide additional information.</p><p>Insertional tendinopathy responds to standard rehabilitation using concentric exercises for Achilles problems, but unlike classic tendinopathy, the benefit of eccentric exercises is less clear. For patients with insertional tendinopathy, eccentric exercise must be added more gradually and only after good progress is made with a concentric exercise program. Even with proper rehabilitation, 3 to 12 months may be needed before ankle plantar flexion strength approaches normal levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. High quality evidence for other treatments is limited, but icing, heel lifts, and compressive straps are often used. Sports insoles and orthotics are used to correct for foot pronation or other alignment issues.</p><p>The results of small randomized trials suggest that topical nitroglycerine relieves symptoms in patients with Achilles tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. While such studies have not focused on insertional tendinopathy, the author has treated and followed hundreds of cases and found the clinical response to be similar in both non-insertional and insertional Achilles tendinopathies. Topical and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce pain but add few, if any, benefits beyond standard rehabilitation. Small trials suggest that extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy along with eccentric rehabilitation leads to faster resolution than rehabilitation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Studies of other treatments, including injections with glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polidocanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polidocanol</a>, autologous blood, platelet rich plasma, and aprotinin, are inconclusive.</p><p>For insertional tendinopathy that persists despite appropriate conservative care, various surgical approaches have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Tendoscopy, open and percutaneous tenotomy, tendon debridement and reattachment, and resection of Haglund deformity with repositioning of the tendon are among the available options. Clinical outcome studies report improvements in pain and functional assessment scores but rates of return to high level sport vary. Complication rates for surgical interventions average approximately 11 percent with infection the primary problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13378352\"><span class=\"h3\">Tarsal tunnel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tarsal tunnel is a bony canal that runs below the medial malleolus and through which travel the posterior tibialis, flexor hallucis, and flexor digitorum tendons, posterior tibial artery and vein, and tibial nerve. Arthritic change or a bone spur off the medial malleolus may reduce the space within the tarsal tunnel and compress the structures contained within it. Tarsal tunnel syndrome often affects individuals with a prior injury to the medial ankle or a markedly pronated gait. When the arch of the foot collapses and the foot pronates excessively, the bones of the tibiotalar or subtalar joint may move and even sublux, and this too can cause compression of the structures running through the tarsal tunnel. Pressure on the tibial nerve causes neuropathic pain that typically radiates to the plantar surface of the forefoot. This is classic tarsal tunnel syndrome. Over time, compression of the tarsal tunnel can also result in injury of the posterior tibialis or flexor hallucis tendons.</p><p>Patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome typically present with aching, burning, numbness, and tingling involving the sole of the foot, the distal foot, the toes, and occasionally the heel. The pain may radiate up to the calf or higher. The discomfort is often most irritating at night, may be worse after standing, and sometimes leads to the desire to remove the shoes, even while driving. The physical examination may be normal in patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome of relatively recent onset. When present, key findings include swelling below and posterior to the medial malleolus. Examination may disclose a prominent Tinel's sign over the nerve posterior to the medial malleolus with sensory loss over the plantar surface of the foot, not extending onto the dorsal foot.</p><p>A markedly pronated foot, significant calcaneal valgus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102233\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102233 \">picture 17</a>), or failure of the rear foot to invert during heel raise is a clue that the patient is at risk for tarsal tunnel syndrome or medial flexor tendon injury. Ultrasound imaging may demonstrate swelling or anatomical changes in the tarsal tunnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98697\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98697 \">image 4</a>). Definitive diagnosis and management of these conditions is reviewed in detail separately.

They complain of pain with running, abrupt change of direction (cutting), and jumping that gets worse with continuing activity. Runners experience this injury from excessive running on banked or uneven surfaces. Shoes with extreme lateral wear may contribute to additional stress on the peroneal tendons. Key observations include swelling behind and below the lateral malleolus, or less often at the base of the fifth metatarsal. In many patients, the foot may be excessively supinated and observation from the rear demonstrates calcaneal varus. Palpation for tenderness and strength testing are key parts of the examination. Peroneal tendon injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-achilles-ankle-tendinopathy#H13857488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Lateral ankle tendinopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13378364\"><span class=\"h3\">Tibiotalar articulation and anterior and posterior ankle impingement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior and posterior aspects of the ankle articulation are the site of pain for a number of conditions.</p><p>Spurring off the anterior distal tibia or the anterior superior talus can produce impingement at the anterior ankle, causing pain around the proximal talus. Such pain can also occur without spurring. In either situation, sports or other activities that cause repeated stressful dorsiflexion of the foot may contribute to the injury. Among jumping sports, basketball and volleyball account for numerous cases of anterior impingement. Ballet and less commonly other dance disciplines place great stress on the ankle, as can activities like hiking or climbing ladders. Anterior ankle swelling or an abnormal contour of the anterior ankle and tibiotalar articulation may be apparent. Ankle dorsiflexion may be limited and localized tenderness present. Standard radiographs usually confirm the diagnosis but sometimes oblique views are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-achilles-ankle-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Posterior ankle impingement arises from bone spurs off the posterior talus or os trigone, an accessory bone. Such impingement causes pain deep to the Achilles tendon in the posterior hind foot. Repeated or stressful plantar flexion often triggers this condition. Ballet dancers are at high risk, and athletes involved in sprinting or jumping sports can develop the condition as well.<strong> </strong>Demi-pli&eacute; position (knees bent while heels remain on the ground) triggers pain in ballet dancers, who can be asked to assume the position as part of their examination. Other athletes can be asked to squat while keeping their heels on the ground to determine whether ankle dorsiflexion reproduces characteristic pain. While patients perform such maneuvers, the examiner can look for motion restrictions or asymmetries (eg, inability to perform maneuver on one side). Deep palpation of the space deep to the distal Achilles tendon may sometimes elicit pain, but often no abnormalities are noted during a static examination, which emphasizes the importance of performing a dynamic examination.</p><p>The lateral corner, or less frequently the medial corner, of the talus may sublux anteriorly in individuals who have sustained multiple ankle sprains, creating an incompetent ligamentous capsule around the talus. For many individuals, this condition creates some abnormal rotation of the foot and the talus will appear more prominently on the lateral (or medial) aspect, which projects out of the mortise. When the lateral corner of the talus is affected, the athlete often demonstrates supination and slight internal rotation of the foot. If the medial corner is affected, this leads to pronation and often external rotation of the foot. An unstable talar position contributes to increased stress on the lateral or medial foot. Pain and swelling may develop, usually in the sinus tarsi laterally or the medial arch and tarsal tunnel medially.</p><p>To manage this injury, clinicians often need to provide the patient with ankle support, in addition to foot pads, a sports insole, or a custom foot orthotic to restore normal foot and ankle alignment. Treating the foot pain without addressing the underlying ankle problem is rarely adequate. Ankle sprains and chronic instability are associated with an increased risk of talar dome fractures and osteochondritis (OCD) of the talus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talus-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Talus fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteochondritis-dissecans-ocd-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H21754048\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Talus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13378370\"><span class=\"h3\">Sinus tarsi syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sinus tarsi, or talocalcaneal sulcus, sits anterior and inferior to the lateral malleolus and is the space between the medial neck of the talus and the superior aspect of the anterior calcaneus. This limited area is bounded by several ligaments and contains tendons, synovium, adipose tissue, and neurovascular structures. Sinus tarsi syndrome appears to be caused by stress at the lateral ankle often involving excessive pronation due to subtalar joint instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As the foot pronates, the lateral calcaneus and cuboid rotate, resulting in compression of the soft tissues in the sinus tarsi against the lateral calcaneus. The end result is that the compressed tissues become inflamed and swollen.</p><p>Patients may note puffiness or swelling at the sinus tarsi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98921\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98921 \">picture 18</a>). Usually, there is little discomfort but at times the area becomes painful and possibly reddened. While in younger individuals the condition may be an acute or subacute syndrome associated with lateral ankle injury, in adults it is more often chronic. The examiner may note a significantly pronated foot with calcaneal valgus. When the patient walks, the foot pronates and the ankle often translates horizontally so that the lateral foot no longer contacts the ground. Palpation reveals soft tissue swelling and at times pain with deep palpation. Ankle motion is usually normal but sometimes shows excessive eversion. Ankle ligaments most often are stable, but when the lateral ankle ligaments manifest laxity, this probably has contributed to the development of the subtalar joint instability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Imaging rarely helps to confirm the diagnosis, although AP and lateral plain radiographs of the ankle and foot may show some signs of osteoarthritis. Ultrasound shows some soft tissue swelling noted by hypoechoic change in the sinus tarsi and some degree of increased Doppler activity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when compared with arthroscopy, fails to reveal the injury causing sinus tarsi syndrome in approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Treatment focuses on ankle compression to reduce swelling and either arch supports or custom orthotics that eliminate pronation and normalize foot position while standing and during gait. Appropriate shoes may assist resolution, as women wearing heels have greater ankle motion, which causes additional swelling in the sinus tarsi. Shoes worn without added arch supports or custom orthotics need good built-in arch supports. In recalcitrant cases of sinus tarsi syndrome, arthroscopic treatment often results in improvement in both pain and function. In one series, 88 percent of patients demonstrated tears of the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament and 55 percent demonstrated synovitis at arthroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13378376\"><span class=\"h3\">Piezogenic papules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Piezogenic papules are small, yellowish nodules noted all around the heel capsule. They result from minor herniations of the fat pad that surrounds the calcaneus through the capsule of connective tissue. Patients rarely notice these as they are asymptomatic. Clinicians can easily identify them by appearance alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F98922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98922 \">picture 19</a>). They have no known clinical significance but may represent indirect evidence of an excessively hard heel strike during the gait cycle. Piezogenic papules are also a characteristic skin finding in Ehlers Danlos syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plantar-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plantar fasciitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1584981\"><span class=\"h3\">Heel contusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contusion of the heel, sometimes referred to as a heel pad or foot pad contusion, can be caused by acute trauma (eg, landing from high fall), stepping on a root or rock during trail running, or chronic overuse (eg, distance running in shoes with inadequate heel cushion). Examination reveals focal soft tissue tenderness at the plantar surface of the mid portion of the heel (not at the insertion of plantar fascia, which suggests plantar fasciitis). This is where the os calcis is most prominent and thus at higher risk of contusion. </p><p>Most injuries are minor and involve break down of the protective fat pad. The fat pad has fibrous septae that act as coil-like shock absorbers during heel strike. These septae enclose the fat cells and hold them in position to provide cushion. When the septae split, the os calcis may have less protection centered under the weight bearing surface, which leads to contusion and pain with impact. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heel pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most injuries are readily managed with standard treatment consisting of rest, ice, support &ndash; including a heel pad and possibly taping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100196\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100196 \">picture 20</a>) &ndash; and over-the-counter analgesics as needed. Sometimes a donut shaped pad at the heel reduces impact at the os calcis and cause less disruption than a full heel pad. A period of non-weight bearing may be needed if pain is severe. More severe pain that does not resolve within five to seven days of appropriate treatment should prompt imaging. When standard heel radiographs are normal, MRI can exclude more serious conditions, such as calcaneal bone contusions with edema or a calcaneal stress fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>As the patient resumes activity, footwear should be checked to determine if heel cushioning is adequate. In some situations, prolonged use of heel pads, soft heel cups, or even a cushioned orthotic may speed return. Activity may be resumed once the patient can run without a limp or too much pain. Activity can be increased steadily once symptoms subside.

Common conditions seen at the first MTP joint include bunions (hallux valgus), hallux rigidus (degenerative arthritis), and turf toe (forced hyperextension of great toe). Gout commonly affects the MTP and causes acute pain, swelling, and redness around the joint. The second most common area of pain in the forefoot is the plantar surface below the second and third metatarsal (MT) diaphyses, so-called metatarsalgia. Conditions affecting the forefoot and their diagnosis are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of forefoot pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common location for midfoot pain is over the dorsum of the articulation of the first tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joint, with pain sometimes extending to the articulations of the second and third tarsometatarsal joints. Such pain, particularly following acute trauma, may stem from a serious injury such as a fracture or fracture dislocation. Diagnosis is made by radiograph. Ganglions can develop at the dorsal midfoot and cause more localized pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98854\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98854 \">picture 11</a>). These can be imaged with ultrasound. Pain in the midfoot can occur along the medial arch. The navicular bone serves as a keystone for arch stability, and any pain directly over the navicular raises the possibility of serious injury. Such injuries can include navicular stress fractures, tendinopathy of the posterior tibialis tendon insertion onto the navicular, traumatic separation of an accessory navicular, and partial or complete tears of the attachment of the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament. Pain over the navicular with an unusual bony prominence suggests a possible accessory navicular, whereas pain over the plantar surface of the arch can arise from an acute strain or longitudinal arch collapse. Tenderness at the base of the fifth MT suggests injury and warrants imaging with plain radiographs, as these injuries can be difficult to diagnose and manage. A table summarizing diagnostic considerations in the patient with midfoot pain is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107781 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13378212\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy-based approach to diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13378288\" class=\"local\">'Midfoot clinical conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common location of rear foot pain is at the insertion of the plantar fascia into the medial aspect of the calcaneus, a location that suggests plantar fasciitis. Most patients with plantar fasciitis describe intense pain when they first step out of bed in the morning. Pain is severe when they begin walking or running, but gradually subsides with activity. Dull pain often persists throughout the day. Pain is relieved by sitting but grows more intense whenever they stand or walk. Night pain is not typical. Examination findings usually include tenderness at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneus. The diagnosis of other rear foot conditions is suggested by the location of pain and tenderness, such as the os calcis on the plantar surface of the heel or the insertion of the Achilles tendon, which suggests distal tendinopathy or enthesopathy. A table summarizing diagnostic considerations in the patient with rear foot pain is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107782 \">table 2</a>).
