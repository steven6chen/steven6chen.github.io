A major tenet of palliative care is early identification, assessment, and treatment of pain and other sources of physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual distress. Depending on the specific problem or complication, specialists, including dentists, may function as essential members of the interdisciplinary team. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Patients at the end of life are susceptible to a range of oral complications including pain, salivary gland dysfunction, dysphagia, and oromucosal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Swallowing disorders may lead to aspiration pneumonia, which can directly contribute to mortality. This topic provides an overview of the importance of oral health in patients at the end of life, and the diagnosis and management of common oral complications. A more extensive discussion of swallowing disorders in palliative care patients is provided elsewhere, as is <span class=\"nowrap\">mucositis/stomatitis</span> related to cancer treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-definition-consequences-pathophysiology-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Definition, consequences, pathophysiology, and etiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Assessment and strategies for management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-toxicity-associated-with-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral toxicity associated with chemotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Mucositis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616553\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY ORAL HEALTH MATTERS IN END OF LIFE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oral cavity is often the first site of manifestation of treatment-related side effects in terminally ill patients, or it may be compromised by the direct and indirect effects of progressive, advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Oral health is essential for carrying out activities of daily living (ADLs) such as communication, eating, speaking, and swallowing. Oral complications that can arise in terminally ill patients can impact quality of life (QOL) and contribute to functional decline and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Oral health care is therefore an integral component of palliative care, with the goals of preventing oral complications, maintaining adequate oral function, and optimizing QOL and comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Oral health impacts a person&rsquo;s dignity as well as oral function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dignity and respect &ndash; </strong>While easily overlooked, a patient&rsquo;s concerns with facial and oral esthetics may relate to his or her desire to die with dignity and respect. As oral health is often neglected at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], usual oral hygiene practices may be forgotten or eliminated, and this can contribute to gingivitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> periodontitis, caries development, tooth loss, and halitosis. This can impact self-esteem. Additionally, family and friends may avoid contact with their loved one due to halitosis, worsening the patient's isolation and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral function</strong> &ndash; Eating and speaking depend on adequate oral function, and the coordinated activity of the muscles of mastication, salivary glands, and the dentition. Compromised oral health can significantly impact function, contributing to eating difficulty, and a diminished capacity to communicate:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decayed, broken, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> missing teeth can compromise mastication, as well as increase the likelihood of oral soft tissue trauma and subsequent disability. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Salivary gland dysfunction (mainly xerostomia but also dysgeusia) can influence appetite, bolus formation, and the ability to swallow, as well as speech and communication. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ill-fitting dentures can compromise oral intake, and further diminish a patient's ability to communicate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The consequences of eating difficulty include reduced food intake, poor nutrition, weight loss, and changes in facial structure. Difficulty with speech and communication can contribute to undue stress and frustration on the part of both patients and their <span class=\"nowrap\">caregivers/families</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>For all of these reasons, routine oral hygiene should be maintained in palliative care patients, if at all possible. (See <a href=\"#H11616643\" class=\"local\">'Preventive oral care'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, given the importance of teeth to appearance to others, facial appearance to self, eating in general, enjoyment of eating, <span class=\"nowrap\">chewing/biting,</span> and comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], replacing decayed, broken, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> missing teeth at the end of life should be addressed, if it is important to the patient, and consistent with the goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H2522961573\" class=\"local\">'Restorative work'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1241525358\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE DENTIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is optimal to include a dentist in the interdisciplinary palliative care team, although not always feasible. The role of the dentist is to maintain and improve quality of life by assessing oral health and status, and determining the need for any dental interventions. In order to minimize overtreatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> even potentially harmful interventions at the end of life, treatment plans must be modified over time, based upon the clinical course <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the patient&rsquo;s goals of care. </p><p>In the absence of a dentist, the palliative care team must be capable of performing an oral health assessment and developing a plan for oral care. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616586\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral health assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive oral health assessment is comprised of symptom assessment, clinical examination, cognitive assessment, functional assessment, and identifying goals of care. It is important to determine if the patient is capable of maintaining <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own oral hygiene and to identify a person to monitor the oral health status of the patient. </p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442455398&amp;token=5zXgaRv5Uo9kWKaTuq6dCRvwYT2zExG50uhUbGlY3lZnzN5wJp6ARSfbWr4y5LYA5tLAAXQQ264fV45tRELZJap6ilsGWv/3KaKgbaB8Qeo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=86293\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT)</a>, a 2004 modification of the Kayser-Jones Brief Oral Health Status Examination tool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102732 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (which was eventually published as a guideline from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]), is a validated instrument that has been used to screen residents of nursing facilities for oral health status, including those with cognitive impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. OHAT is a screening tool, not a diagnostic tool, and it is designed for use by nondental professionals. This tool can be used to assess the oral health status of a patient and to identify the need for an examination by a dentist. The tool can also be used as an intervention tool to establish a patient's oral health status at baseline, prior to initiating an individualized oral hygiene care plan, and to monitor progress of the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Pain should be addressed and quantified using validated tools (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61221 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67351\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef67351 \">form 1</a>). Patients at the end of life may only be able to convey nonverbal cues of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. It is important to observe patient behaviors that are considered pain-related. The American Geriatric Society categorizes six types of behavioral pain indicators, which may be helpful in the assessment of oral pain in the nonverbal patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102314 \">table 2</a>). As with verbal patients, pain should be assessed, evaluated, documented, and repeatedly reassessed in nonverbal patients using an appropriate pain assessment tool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F103690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103690 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Family members, friends, and caregivers should be engaged to participate in the pain assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain assessment and management in the last weeks of life&quot;, section on 'Pain assessment'</a>.) </p><p>An oral exam should be undertaken to identify oral pathology and the state of oral hygiene. Oral function related to a patient's ability to chew food, insert and remove dental prosthesis, and speak should also be assessed and reported. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616592\"><span class=\"h2\">Scope of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The scope of oral care provided by dentists at the end of life may be restorative, preventive, or simply a symptom-based comfort care, and may include extraction of infected or loose teeth, and restoring carious teeth with interim restorative materials. The complexity of palliative care dentistry lies in the lack of evidence-based care guidelines, and the need to individualize and prioritize the components of care in a way that corresponds to the patient's health status and overall goals of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11616649\" class=\"local\">'Management/treatment of common conditions'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616598\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON ORAL DISEASES AT THE END OF LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common oral problems among terminally-ill patients are xerostomia, oromucosal pain, and problems with eating, as illustrated by the following two reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study conducted in 20 hospice patients in England demonstrated that the most common oral symptoms were xerostomia (58 percent of patients), mucosal pain (42 percent), dysphagia (37 percent), and disturbance of taste (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, a Norwegian study of 126 cancer patients receiving palliative care showed that xerostomia (78 percent), oral pain (67 percent), problems with food intake (56 percent), oral candidiasis (34 percent), and dental plaque accumulation (24 percent) were frequently observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p>Several oral complications increase in frequency as the disease progresses. In one study of 105 patients admitted to an inpatient palliative care unit, the frequencies of dry mouth (78 versus 54 percent), tongue inflammation (67 versus 46 percent), and dysphagia (43 versus 20 percent) were all significantly more common in those who lived fewer than 28 days from the time of dental assessment compared to those living 28 days or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616631\"><span class=\"h2\">Salivary gland dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salivary gland dysfunction is defined as any qualitative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> quantitative change in the output of saliva. Salivary gland dysfunction in terminally-ill patients can manifest as both reduced (salivary gland hypofunction), as well as excessive salivary flow (sialorrhea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Normal unstimulated whole salivary flow rate averages 0.3 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Hyposalivation occurs when the unstimulated whole salivary flow rate is &le;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although xerostomia is a frequent complication of radiation therapy (RT) to the head and neck region, the primary cause of reduced flow in terminally ill patients is the use of xerogenic medications and polypharmacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F108327\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108327 \">table 4</a>). In one survey, hospice patients with advanced cancer were on a median number of four drugs that were associated with xerostomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Dry mouth and limited oral intake may also lead to an over-keratinization of the tongue dorsum (&quot;hairy tongue&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102280\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102280 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Sialorrhea or excess drooling may be caused by neuromuscular dysfunctions in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, and Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-mouth-care-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Saliva pools in the mouth due to a lack of swallowing rather than to a true salivary gland hyperfunction. Sialorrhea may also occur in patients affected by Alzheimer disease or myasthenia gravis who take drugs with reversible cholinesterase inhibitor activity. Sialorrhea can contribute to skin irritation, poor oral health, and dehydration, and increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Furthermore, it is embarrassing and socially disabling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84628721\"><span class=\"h2\">Swallowing disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphagia is a common condition in terminally ill patients, especially in those with brain tumors, advanced neurologic disorders, and cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. <span class=\"nowrap\">Hyposalivation/xerostomia</span> can further contribute to dysphagia.
