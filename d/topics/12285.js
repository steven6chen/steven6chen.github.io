The clinical presentation of PE is variable and often nonspecific making the diagnosis challenging. The evaluation of patients with suspected PE should be efficient so that patients can be diagnosed and therapy administered quickly to reduce the associated morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The definition, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology of PE are discussed in detail in this topic. A broad overview of the clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis as well as treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of PE is also provided in this topic; however, a detailed discussion of these issues is provided separately.

This topic review focuses upon PE due to thrombus. Tumor, air, and fat emboli are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in adults: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-embolism-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fat embolism syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86227300\"><span class=\"h2\">Nomenclature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PE can be classified by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The temporal pattern of presentation (acute, subacute, or chronic)</strong> &ndash; Patients with PE can present acutely, subacutely, or chronically:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute &ndash; Patients with acute PE typically develop symptoms and signs immediately after obstruction of pulmonary vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subacute &ndash; Some patients with PE may also present subacutely within days or weeks following the initial event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic &ndash; Patients with chronic PE slowly develop symptoms of pulmonary hypertension over many years (ie, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; CTEPH).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An overview of acute and subacute PE is discussed in this review. The etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of CTEPH are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The presence or absence of hemodynamic stability (hemodynamically unstable or stable)</strong> &ndash; Hemodynamically unstable PE is also called &quot;<strong>massive</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>high-risk</strong>&quot; PE. Hemodynamically stable PE is called &quot;<strong>submassive&quot; </strong>or<strong> </strong>&quot;intermediate-risk&quot; PE if there is associated right ventricular strain, or &quot;low-risk&quot; PE if there is no evidence of right ventricular strain. Hemodynamically stable and unstable PE are defined as the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodynamically unstable PE is that which results in hypotension. Hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or a drop in systolic blood pressure of &ge;40 mmHg from baseline for a period &gt;15 minutes or hypotension that requires vasopressors or inotropic support and is not explained by other causes such as sepsis, arrhythmia, left ventricular dysfunction from acute myocardial ischemia or infarction, or hypovolemia. Although hemodynamically unstable PE is often caused by large (ie, massive) PE, it can sometimes be due to small PE in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Thus, the term &quot;massive&quot; PE does not necessarily describe the size of the PE as much as its hemodynamic effect. (See <a href=\"#H446823334\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiologic response to PE'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodynamically stable PE is defined as PE that does not meet the definition of hemodynamically unstable PE. There is a spectrum of severity within this population ranging from patients who present with small, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic PE (also known as &quot;low-risk PE&quot;) to those who present with mild or borderline hypotension that stabilizes in response to fluid therapy, or those who present with right ventricle dysfunction (also known as &quot;submassive&quot; or &quot;intermediate-risk&quot; PE). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombolytic-fibrinolytic-therapy-in-acute-pulmonary-embolism-and-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis#H11044869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy in acute pulmonary embolism and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamically stable patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The distinction between hemodynamically stable and unstable PE is important because patients with hemodynamically unstable PE are more likely to die from obstructive shock (ie, severe right ventricular failure). Importantly, death from hemodynamically unstable PE often occurs within the first two hours, and the risk remains elevated for up to 72 hours after presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Approximately 3 to 6 percent of patients with PE present with a saddle embolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Traditionally, saddle PE was thought to be associated with hemodynamic instability and death. However, retrospective studies suggest that among those diagnosed with a saddle embolus, only 22 percent are hemodynamically unstable, with an associated mortality of 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Clot that is &quot;in transit&quot; through the heart is often classified as a form of PE, even though the thrombus has not yet lodged in a pulmonary artery. Clot-in-transit is associated with high mortality (up to 40 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most PE move beyond the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery to lodge distally in the main lobar, segmental, or subsegmental branches of a pulmonary artery. PE can be bilateral or unilateral, depending on whether they obstruct arteries in the right, left, or both lungs. Smaller thrombi that are located in the peripheral segmental or subsegmental branches are more likely to cause pulmonary infarction and pleuritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99736\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99736 \">image 1</a>).

One database analysis reported a doubling in the incidence of PE from 62 cases per 100,000 in the five year period before 1998 to 112 cases per 100,000 in the seven years after 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other studies have confirmed similar increased rates over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, a Canadian database reported an incidence rate of PE as 0.38 per 1000 person years, a rate that appeared to be stable between 2002 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The overall incidence is higher in males compared with females (56 versus 48 per 100,000, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The incidence rises with increasing age, particularly in women, such that PE has an incidence of &gt;500 per 100,000 after the age of 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].

Among VTE-related deaths in Europe, three-quarters were due to hospital-acquired PE, and one-third were sudden fatal PE; 7 percent were diagnosed antemortem, and the remainder were diagnosed postmortem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, many causes of sudden cardiac death are thought to be secondary to PE, so the actual mortality attributable to PE is difficult to estimate. </p><p>Deaths from diagnosed PE have been declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/8,12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,20</a>], with one study reporting deaths from PE that decreased between 1979-1998, from 191 to 94 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In another study, the mortality risk ratio from PE declined from 138 (95% CI, 125-153) in 1980-1989 to 36.08 (95% CI, 32.65-39.87) in 2000-2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Overall mortality from PE appears to be high.

However, if untreated, one-third of calf vein DVT extend into the proximal veins, where they have greater potential to embolize.

In patients with PE, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is increased due to physical obstruction of the vascular bed with thrombus and hypoxic vasoconstriction within the pulmonary arterial system. Increased PVR, in turn, impedes right ventricular outflow and causes right ventricular dilation and flattening or bowing of the intraventricular septum. Both diminished flow from the right ventricle and right ventricular dilation reduce left ventricular preload thereby compromising CO.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, when obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed approaches 75 percent, the right ventricle must generate a systolic pressure in excess of 50 mmHg to preserve adequate pulmonary artery flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. When the right ventricle is unable to accomplish this, it fails and hypotension ensues. Thus, in patients without underlying cardiopulmonary disease, multiple large thrombi are generally responsible for hypotension via this mechanism. In contrast, in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, hypotension can be induced by smaller emboli, likely due to a substantial vasoconstrictive response <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an inability of the right ventricle to generate sufficient pressure to combat high PVR. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION, EVALUATION, AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86227218\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary embolism (PE) has a wide variety of presenting features, ranging from no symptoms to shock or sudden death.

It is due to obstruction of a pulmonary artery or one of its branches by material (eg, thrombus, tumor, air, or fat) that originated elsewhere in the body. (See <a href=\"#H86227294\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PE can be classified according to the presence or absence of hemodynamic stability (hemodynamically unstable or stable), the temporal pattern of presentation (acute, subacute, or chronic), the anatomic location (saddle, lobar, segmental, subsegmental), and the presence or absence of symptoms (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Patients with hemodynamically unstable PE, defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or a drop in systolic blood pressure of &ge;40 mmHg from baseline for &gt;15 minutes, should be distinguished from patients with hemodynamically stable PE because they are more likely to die from obstructive shock in the first two hours of presentation and may therefore benefit from more aggressive treatment. (See <a href=\"#H86227300\" class=\"local\">'Nomenclature'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall incidence of PE is approximately 112 cases per 100,000. PE is slightly more common in males than females and incidence increases with age. Deaths from PE account for approximately 100,000 deaths per year in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H26146960\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of PE is similar to that of deep venous thrombosis.

However, they may also originate in right heart, inferior vena cava or the pelvic veins, and in the renal and upper extremity veins.
