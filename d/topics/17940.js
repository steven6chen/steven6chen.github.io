The choice of the DMARD regimen in patients resistant to initial DMARD treatment depends largely upon the responses to the specific medications that have been used previously. It should also be tailored to the individual patient based upon their comorbid conditions, fertility considerations, and preference for route of administration (oral versus parenteral), as well as regulatory or insurance limitations and cost to the patient. The choice among available agents is dependent upon the initial DMARD therapy and upon disease activity.

Precautions relevant to the use of each new agent being prescribed should be reviewed before initiating such therapy to confirm that all appropriate measures have been performed. A chest radiograph should be obtained prior to initiating treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX). These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In patients with only mildly active disease when DMARDs were initiated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ) may have been started, and the patient may not have received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX). Such patients should then be started on MTX, either in place of or in addition to these agents. In patients who have already been treated with MTX without achieving therapeutic goals, treatment combining MTX with other nonbiologic DMARDs or with a biologic DMARD is the next step. (See <a href=\"#H109285579\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to HCQ and/or SSZ'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12087126\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to MTX'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12087392\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109285579\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistant to HCQ and/or SSZ</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients resistant to three to six months of therapy with HCQ or SSZ for initially mildly active disease, we suggest adding an alternative DMARD, usually MTX; the approach in these patients is generally similar to that for patients with moderately to severely active disease presenting for initial DMARD therapy. An acceptable alternative would be treatment with a combination of HCQ, SSZ, and MTX, termed &ldquo;triple therapy&rdquo; (see <a href=\"#H2437292892\" class=\"local\">'DMARD triple therapy'</a> below). A therapeutic trial of greater than three months is generally used in patients with partial responses showing progressive improvement, particularly in those in this group with low levels of disease activity and with limited functional impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-to-methotrexate-for-the-initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives to methotrexate for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and reevaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3981583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy with methotrexate'</a>.)</p><p>We prefer MTX over alternative nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs in such patients for several reasons. MTX typically serves as the &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; drug for the most commonly used DMARD combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Randomized head-to-head trials have found that MTX has a faster onset of action, comparable or greater efficacy, better long-term tolerance, and results in improved survival, compared with other nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Direct comparisons of MTX with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor monotherapy have also shown similar clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Additionally, those patients with an inadequate response to MTX can be quickly identified and subsequently treated prior to the development of irreversible injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. There is also some evidence that risk may be greater with biologic agents, and there are frequently regulatory or cost barriers to the use of biologic therapies in patients who have not been treated with MTX. Treatment with MTX is reviewed in detail separately, and the efficacy of such &ldquo;triple therapy&rdquo; with this DMARD combination is discussed in further detail below.

Optimization of MTX dosing is described in more detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Dosing of MTX'</a>). In patients with partial responses or showing progressive improvement, we may continue therapy with MTX for greater than three months before switching to one of these approaches, particularly in those with low to moderate levels of disease activity and with limited functional impairment.

Either can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Usual practice since TNF inhibitors came into clinical use beginning in the late 1990s has been to add a TNF inhibitor to MTX in patients with an inadequate response to MTX or combinations of nonbiologic DMARDs. Abatacept and tocilizumab have each generally been used in practice only following inadequate responses to both MTX and TNF inhibitors. However, both of these biologic agents are available for use in the United States for patients who have not responded adequately to MTX alone. (See <a href=\"#H7014295\" class=\"local\">'MTX plus abatacept'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=randomized-clinical-trials-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-of-biologic-agents-that-inhibit-il-1-il-6-and-rankl#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Randomized clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis of biologic agents that inhibit IL-1, IL-6, and RANKL&quot;, section on 'Tocilizumab'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12087392\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of treatment options are reasonable in patients with an inadequate response to MTX therapy. The choice of drug combinations in such patients depends upon a combination of factors, including the level of disease activity, the presence of comorbid conditions, patient preferences for route of administration and frequency of dosing, the presence of adverse prognostic features, and regulatory and cost barriers to drug access. The triple therapy regimen (MTX plus SSZ plus HCQ) has been found to be of similar clinical efficacy to MTX plus a biologic in several randomized trials, including in patients with high levels of disease activity or with adverse prognostic features. (See <a href=\"#H3084364\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of triple therapy versus MTX/TNF inhibitor'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H344394776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer triple therapy with MTX, SSZ, and HCQ in patients for whom personal drug cost, regulatory restrictions on the use of biologic DMARDs, or preference for an oral nonbiologic agent, rather than an injectable, is an important factor. The use of triple therapy has been shown to be highly cost-effective compared with combining a biologic with MTX, providing comparable or near-comparable benefit, depending upon the trial, at a markedly lower total cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In addition, concern regarding the risk of serious infections, the uncertain long-term increased risk of malignancy, and other possible adverse effects may influence clinician or patient preference for nonbiologic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].

All of the available TNF inhibitors appear to provide comparable benefit. These regimens may have a faster onset of action compared with DMARD triple therapy. However, use of a TNF inhibitor or other biologic requires subcutaneous injections or intravenous infusions, and regulatory or cost considerations may limit access. (See <a href=\"#H7011196\" class=\"local\">'MTX plus TNF inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The combination of MTX with a TNF inhibitor is also preferred for patients who do not achieve a satisfactory response within three to six months with nonbiologic triple therapy following an inadequate response to MTX. In such patients, we either discontinue SSZ and HCQ and administer a TNF inhibitor with the MTX, or continue both the HCQ and SSZ (or just one of the agents, usually the HCQ) when adding a TNF inhibitor, particularly in patients who have experienced partial clinical benefit. However, this latter practice has not been formally evaluated or compared with other approaches, and patient tolerance or preferences regarding concerns about adverse effects, as well as clinician preference, also affect the choice of drug combinations.

The efficacy of abatacept subcutaneously (125 mg subcutaneously on days 1 and 8, then weekly, plus an intravenous loading dose on day one of approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> was comparable to abatacept intravenously (approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV on days 1, 15, and 29, then every four weeks) in achieving an ACR20 response after six months of treatment (both 76 percent). The onset and magnitude of the responses, disease activity, improvements in physical function, and adverse effects were also comparable.

Abatacept also appears to increase the risk of serious infections, including pneumonia, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, and diverticulitis. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), if abatacept is used it should be with particular caution because of the higher rates of COPD exacerbations and respiratory tract infections reported in such patients in the randomized trials of this agent.

The overall safety of abatacept appears comparable to or possibly slightly better than that of the TNF inhibitors, although there are few direct comparisons.

However, we generally avoid discontinuing all DMARD treatment, and there are insufficient data to prospectively identify which patients will be able to successfully reduce or discontinue therapy without clinical recurrence or radiographic progression. Although some patients may tolerate a reduced dose of medications, the decision to discontinue DMARDs in patients in remission remains controversial.</p><p>Our approach is based upon the available data and our clinical experience.

Additionally, clinical remission can be difficult to achieve upon resumption of DMARD therapy in patients who have discontinued all DMARDs.

The combination of MTX with a TNF inhibitor is also preferred for patients who do not achieve a satisfactory response within three to six months with nonbiologic triple therapy following an inadequate response to MTX. In such patients, we either discontinue SSZ and HCQ and administer a TNF inhibitor with the MTX, or continue both the HCQ and SSZ (or just one of the agents, usually the HCQ) when adding a TNF inhibitor, particularly in patients who have experienced partial clinical benefit.

We use antiinflammatory drug therapy, including NSAIDs or glucocorticoids, on a temporary basis to quickly achieve control of signs and symptoms of disease, and we then taper and withdraw these medications once a new DMARD regimen has taken effect.
