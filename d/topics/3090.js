However, SVT can also produce a wide QRS complex through the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aberrant conduction</strong> &minus; Conduction through the His-Purkinje system can be delayed or blocked, which results in a wide QRS complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-approach-to-delayed-intraventricular-conduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic approach to delayed intraventricular conduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) with an accessory pathway</strong> &minus; AVRT requires the presence of an extranodal accessory pathway connecting the atrium and ventricle. This allows direct electrical communication between the two chambers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During AVRT tachycardia, QRS complexes can be either narrow or wide depending upon the direction of conduction through the reentrant pathway. If the ventricles are activated antegrade via the accessory pathway followed by retrograde conduction over the atrioventricular (AV) <span class=\"nowrap\">node/His-Purkinje</span> system, the QRS complex will be wide. This is known as antidromic reciprocating tachycardia (ART) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54484\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54484 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71410\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef71410 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the more common orthodromic form with a narrow QRS complex, the ventricles are activated antegrade through the AV node followed by retrograde conduction back to the atria via the accessory pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SVT is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular tachycardia (VT) originates from the ventricular myocardium or Purkinje cells below the bifurcation of the bundle of His. It is reported to occur in 3 percent of healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>VT may be associated with sudden cardiac death. As a result, patients who develop VT or are at risk for developing VT must be identified, evaluated, and treated if necessary. Some forms of VT found primarily in infants and young children may be benign, but this conclusion is reached only after other more serious causes of VT are excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest and death in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>VT is defined as three or more consecutive beats of ventricular origin on electrocardiogram (ECG). It can occur in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), an inherited disorder that affects cardiac electrical or myocardial function, acquired heart disease, or in the setting of a structurally and functionally normal heart.</p><p>In one retrospective review from a single Swiss center, 27 children with spontaneous episodes of VT were observed from 1995 to 2005; 13 had no structural heart disease, and the remaining 14 patients had a wide range of underlying cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Five patients died, all of whom had underlying cardiac disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrhythmias, including VT, are seen as a late complication in children and adults with CHD, and are associated with a significant increase in mortality and serious morbidity. The electrical pathophysiology in CHD is based upon a complex interplay between gross cardiac anatomy, chamber enlargement from abnormal pressure and volume loads, cellular injury from hypoxia and cardiopulmonary bypass, fibrosis at the site of suture lines, and direct trauma to the specialized conduction tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Ventricular arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CHD patients as they reach adulthood. Because of the number of survivors, VT is most frequently associated with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), although it may occur in patients with other congenital defects (eg, transposition of the great arteries, Ebstein anomaly, and lesions with left ventricular outflow obstruction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. VT risk is possibly highest in adults with D-transposition of the great arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Most studies of VT and CHD focus on a specific lesion and often favor the study of more common lesions with a surgical outcome good enough to provide reasonable patient numbers. Thus, many studies focus on TOF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot#H99137091\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of tetralogy of Fallot&quot;, section on 'Arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p>After surgical repair of TOF, the incidences of VT and sudden cardiac death have been reported to be as high as 12 and 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The origin of VT is primarily at the site of surgical repair. Although less common, ventricular arrhythmias have been seen in patients with CHD who have not undergone intracardiac surgical repair, suggesting that surgical scar is not the only substrate for VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].</p><p>In individuals with repaired or palliated CHD including TOF, the presence of residual cardiac defects, volume overload, or cardiac dysfunction has been associated with an increased risk of VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In adults with repaired TOF, left ventricular failure has been associated with sudden death following surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In fact, moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram has proven to be a stronger predictor of serious cardiac events than any right ventricular variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Several studies have also reported that postoperative patients with a QRS duration that is greater than or equal to 180 msec were more likely to develop VT or sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Other reported risk factors for VT following surgical repair for TOF include older age at repair and increased length of time from repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], a history of palliative shunts, inducible VT at electrophysiology (EP) testing, and high grade ventricular ectopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A later age at repair seems to correlate with the development of left ventricular dysfunction, possibly due to prolonged periods of time with ventricular volume overload and hypoxia.</p><p>Although patients may experience slow VT and are hemodynamically stable at presentation, some patients present with rapid VT that results in syncope or cardiac arrest. Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common cause of sudden death in patients following surgical repair for TOF; however, atrial arrhythmias and atrioventricular (AV) block may also have catastrophic outcomes in adults with CHD, including death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot#H1185496\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of tetralogy of Fallot&quot;, section on 'Sudden cardiac death'</a>.)</p><p>EP testing with programmed ventricular stimulation is useful in identifying postoperative patients with CHD who are at increased risk of developing serious arrhythmias including VT. This was illustrated in a study of 252 postoperative patients with TOF (mean age 16 years) who had programmed ventricular stimulation at the time of EP testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Sustained monomorphic VT was induced in 30 percent and polymorphic VT in 4.4 percent of patients. There was a threefold increase in the incidence of symptomatic VT or sudden death in patients with a positive EP study compared with those with a negative test. Thus, the induction of VT at EP testing is an imperfect but powerful predictor, independent of ECG and other clinical variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The management of VT in patients with CHD is discussed separately.

Causes of acquired prolonged QTc duration (eg, drugs, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia) can also precipitate ventricular arrhythmia in patients with congenital LQTS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 3</a>).

A family history of sudden death, seizures, recurrent syncope, or unexplained drowning should heighten the suspicion of LQTS. In addition, a link between LQTS and sudden infant death syndrome has been reported.

High-risk patients including those with syncope or torsades de pointes despite beta-blocker therapy may benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation or left cardiac sympathetic denervation. The strict sports restrictions previously applied to all patients with LQTS should be tailored to the patient and to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> genotypic and phenotypic expression of the disease. Physical exertion (particularly swimming) appears to be a common trigger for ventricular arrhythmias in LQT1, whereas individuals with LQT2 seem more at risk for auditory or emotional triggers, as well as postpartum events. Patients with LQT3 may be at greater risk during periods of rest and during times when the heart rate is slow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64239 \">figure 1</a>). However, exceptions to these genotype-phenotype correlations hinder genotype-specific tailoring of competitive sports recommendations. The genotype and phenotype, as well as family and patient considerations, must be considered before any eligibility or disqualification decision is rendered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Brugada syndrome is associated with characteristic ECG findings of ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3 and a right bundle branch block-like pattern in the right precordial leads, which can be triggered by the fever (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64510\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64510 \">waveform 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100119\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef100119 \">waveform 5</a>).

Gene mutations of <em>SCN5A</em>, which encodes for the subunit of a cardiac sodium channel, resulting in a loss of sodium channel function, have been found in 10 to 30 percent of patients with Brugada syndrome. In contrast, patients with congenital LQTS have <em>SCN5A</em> mutations that results in a gain in sodium channel function. Genetic mutations, other than <em>SCN5A</em> mutations, may also produce the phenotypic characteristics of Brugada syndrome. Numerous other genes have been associated with the Brugada syndrome ECG pattern.

Sudden cardiac death may be the first and only clinical event in Brugada syndrome, occurring in as many as one-third of patients. Death usually occurs during sleep and in the early morning hours.

Like LQT1, there are increasing data to suggest that some drowning and near drowning events and sudden infant death syndrome are associated with CPVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At rest, the ECG typically is normal.

It commonly occurs in infancy and less frequently in adults. One possible explanation for the increased prevalence during childhood is the intensity of exercise is more limited in infants and the more sedentary adult population, resulting in fewer affected patients in these age groups. Approximately 30 percent of patients have a family history of sudden death, often in adolescence. Prognosis is guarded, even in patients in whom the disease is identified and treatment instituted. The mainstay of therapy includes beta blockers, with emerging encouraging results from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">flecainide</a>. There are increasing data about the superiority of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nadolol</a> over other beta blockers for CPVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. ICD or left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) have been used for high-risk patients and those with symptoms despite medical therapy. The emerging recognition of the risk of ICD storm in this population is negatively influencing the decision for ICD implantation in children with CPVT. LCSD has proven an effective antifibrillatory intervention for these patients.

In a retrospective study from a tertiary center from 1968 to 2010, 173 children were identified with primary cardiac tumors (eg, fibroma [n = 25], myxoma [n = 14], teratoma [n = 4], lipoma [n = 3], and other masses [n = 15]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of these, approximately one-quarter had significant arrhythmias, VT being the most common abnormality. In particular, two-thirds of patients with fibromas had VT.

Accelerated ventricular rhythm is a relatively slow monomorphic ventricular rhythm. The rate tends to be just slightly faster than the sinus rate (15 to 20 percent faster) and so varies with age, but most often it is &lt;120 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although most commonly seen in newborns, accelerated ventricular rhythm may be present in older children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Accelerated ventricular rhythm is distinguished from VT because of its slower rate and the absence of symptoms. In addition, accelerated ventricular rhythm is usually suppressed by exertion, whereas VT from other causes may persist or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation during exercise. Accelerated ventricular rhythm is generally diagnosed only in patients with a structurally and functionally normal heart, although rare cases have been seen in children with CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The ECG typically shows sinus rhythm followed by fusion beats at the onset of the ventricular rhythm and at its termination. The EP mechanism is unknown and may include triggered activity or abnormal automaticity.</p><p>Accelerated ventricular rhythm is usually a benign condition that often occurs in newborn infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It most often resolves spontaneously and should not be treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, it is important to differentiate this rhythm disturbance from pathologic VT to avoid potentially toxic antiarrhythmic agents. Patients should be followed until resolution to monitor cardiac function because a decline in cardiac function may rarely occur in patients with frequent ventricular ectopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Accelerated ventricular rhythm is thought to be due to enhanced automaticity of the myocardium or His-Purkinje fibers. Although typically benign, in the setting of metabolic disarray, ischemia, or myocardial disease it may be a harbinger of more malignant ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most common ventricular arrhythmias in young patients, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is a benign condition that may resolve spontaneously.

In the previously mentioned Canadian study, 13 of the 25 patients studied by MRI had abnormalities of the right ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>A major challenge for the clinician is to distinguish children with RVOT tachycardia from the more serious ARVC, discussed above, which has a high risk of sudden cardiac death.
