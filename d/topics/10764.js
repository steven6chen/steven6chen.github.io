The majority of patients with chronic stable angina are still treated with medical therapy; however, revascularization with either coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be considered in several subgroups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Indications for revascularization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The medical therapies that can minimize the short-term, particularly perioperative complications that can occur following conventional CABG (using cardiopulmonary bypass) will be reviewed here. A general discussion of the early complications of CABG is presented separately.

Thus, most patients referred for CABG take aspirin daily and we continue aspirin until surgery. For patients with a new diagnosis of CVD (and not taking aspirin) and who need CABG, the decision to start aspirin preoperatively should be individualized, taking into account the duration of the delay to surgery (ie, risk of an ischemic event in the interval between diagnosis and CABG), the bleeding risk at the time of surgery, and potential problems associated with starting a new medication shortly before surgery. If the delay is more than five days, we start aspirin in most cases. If the delay is less than five days, most of our experts start aspirin in patients not at high bleeding risk. </p><p>In general, the decision to start or to continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> prior to CABG needs to balance the risks of excess bleeding with potential benefits such as increased graft patency or survival or a lower rate of perioperative ischemic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The following studies attempted to clarify the role of aspirin in patients who will be having CABG within four or five days.</p><p>The ATACAS trial randomly assigned 2100 stable CABG patients to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (100 mg) or placebo administered one to two hours before surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Entry criteria required that all patients had to have not been taking aspirin regularly before the trial or had stopped taking aspirin at least for five days before CABG. There was no difference in the rate primary outcome (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, renal failure, or bowel infarction) within 30 days (19.3 versus 20.4 percent; relative risk 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.12). Similarly, there was no difference in the rate of major hemorrhage leading to reoperation (1.8 versus 2.1 percent; p = 0.75) and no difference in the rate of cardiac tamponade (1.1 versus 0.4 percent; p = 0.08). Mortality was nonsignificantly increased in the aspirin group (1.3 versus 0.9 percent; risk ratio 1.56, 95% CI 0.68-3.60). </p><p>Older (than ATACAS) studies had come to differing conclusions regarding the net benefit and harm of preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized trials published in 1990 and 1991 found that preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy increased the need for reoperation for postoperative bleeding (6.6 versus 1.7 percent and 6.3 versus 2.4 percent in two trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

All therapy, except aspirin was started 48 hours before surgery and aspirin was given 12 hours before surgery. At 60 days, all regimens improved graft patency compared with placebo; however, the rate of reoperation after CABG was increased. The second trial (1991) compared the efficacy of aspirin (325 mg) or placebo given the night before surgery, with postoperative aspirin being given to all patients beginning six hours after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There was no difference in saphenous vein graft occlusion between the two groups at an average of eight days after surgery (7.4 versus 7.8 percent), but there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower rate of occlusion of internal thoracic artery grafts (0 versus 2.4 percent) for the group receiving aspirin preoperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational data suggest that preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> may reduce in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Among 1519 well-matched pairs of patients, there was no significant difference between those with early and late aspirin discontinuation with regard to the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke (1.7 versus 1.8 percent).

However, this general approach is no longer recommended. The 2015 American Heart Association Scientific Statement on &ldquo;Secondary Prevention after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery&rdquo; recommended that aspirin be started or continued preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Among stable patients not previously on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, benefit may be seen with aspirin started one hour after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. However, with increasing experience, some surgeons recommend continuation of aspirin throughout the preoperative period.

This is not a problem in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), but is a potential problem in patients with a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with an intended invasive strategy or in patients with recently placed stents.

Thus, most patients referred for CABG will be receiving a statin.</p><p>In addition, statin therapy is associated with lower crude in-hospital mortality when given to patients undergoing major noncardiac (usually vascular) surgery within the first two hospital days compared to either later or no statin therapy.

A 2015 meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials that compared statin therapy with either placebo or no therapy prior to cardiac surgery (predominantly CABG) found that such treatment reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.43-0.67) but failed to influence short-term mortality or postoperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, the meta-analysis pointed out significant limitations of the evidence. <br/><br/>The largest randomized trial of preoperative statin therapy was published after the meta-analysis. In the STICS trial, 1922 patients in sinus rhythm scheduled for elective cardiac surgery (87 percent CABG) were randomly assigned to receive perioperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> (20 mg daily) or placebo up to eight days before surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Any previously prescribed statin was stopped. The rate of the primary outcome of postoperative atrial fibrillation within five days of surgery was similar in both groups (21.1 and 20.5 percent, respectively; odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.30). Of note, there was no difference in the rate of myocardial injury within 120 hours after surgery. In addition, rosuvastatin was associated with a significant absolute excess in the rate of postoperative acute kidney injury (24.7 versus 19.3 percent; p = 0.005).<br/> </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112271285\"><span class=\"h1\">ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors around the time of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is not well established.
