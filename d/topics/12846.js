As with dyspnea, these respiratory symptoms may be particularly frightening to patients, their families, and their caregivers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-dyspnea-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Palliative management focuses on symptom relief; this may occur alongside therapies to treat or reverse the underlying cause(s). Palliative management also includes the amelioration of the psychosocial and spiritual impacts of these potentially life-threatening symptoms, utilizing a team approach.

This decision must be individualized for each patient. However, a general rule for palliative care patients is that a diagnostic test should be performed only if it will yield information that will affect management. Too often in advanced disease, tests are ordered as a means of palliating the clinician&rsquo;s feeling of helplessness. Additionally, if a test or intervention is not consistent with the patient&rsquo;s goals of care, it may add burden or risk without any benefit. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2990409\"><span class=\"h1\">COUGH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section will summarize cough when it is being managed palliatively in the setting of an advanced serious life-threatening illness. Acute and chronic cough in adults and children, including details about potential mechanisms and treatments, is defined, and differential diagnosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic cough in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic cough in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute cough is a mechanism to clear the airways of mucus and foreign bodies when mucociliary transport is insufficient. When a cough becomes chronic, it is disruptive, distressing, and physically exhausting. It impairs social relationships and worsens other symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, incontinence, and sleep disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It can also cause rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mildest cough may be almost imperceptible to the patient; yet, its importance to the patient and family is linked to the underlying disease (eg, the cancer is still there). The most severe cough is convulsive, unending, terrifying, and permits no other object of attention for the patient or family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2990416\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis and underlying causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involuntary cough is initiated when rapidly adapting &ldquo;irritant&rdquo; receptors (RARs) that transmit through fast-velocity myelinated vagal nerve fibers are stimulated. Receptors are present in the epithelium of the upper and lower airways, but the most sensitive sites for cough induction are the larynx, carina, and branching points in the tracheobronchial tree. RARs respond to a wide variety of chemical (eg, smoke), inflammatory (eg, histamine), and mechanical (eg, sputum) stimuli. Their stimulation may also lead to bronchoconstriction and mucous hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;, section on 'Cough reflex arc'</a>.)</p><p>In palliative care populations, the cough reflex can be stimulated by attempts to expectorate accumulating secretions. This occurs in up to 80 percent of patients with cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In many advanced disease processes, asthenia, muscle weakness, and the inability to coordinate an effective swallow near the end of life results in ineffective, persistent coughing. </p><p>Other causes are related to the underlying disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105887382\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cough in people with malignancy is most commonly associated with cancers of the airways, lungs, pleura, and mediastinum, but can occur with other cancers that metastasize to the thorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>For patients with advanced cancer, cough is reported in 23 to 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Up to 90 percent of patients with advanced lung cancer report cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and it is rated as moderate to severe in up to one-half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A high rate of cough (over 90 percent) is also reported in palliative care patients with advanced head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The presence of cough has been shown to predict a shorter overall survival in patients with lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The causes of cough associated with advanced cancer are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F91822\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91822 \">table 1</a>). Among patients with lung cancer, cough is more likely to indicate involvement of the central airways than the lung parenchyma because of where the cough receptors are located.</p><p>The etiology of cough may be multifactorial. The evaluation of cough should include a search for contributory factors other than the cancer itself (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F91823\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91823 \">table 2</a>). As an example, for patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia following treatment for head and neck cancer, cough may be an important indicator of aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105887409\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonmalignant disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cough is also common in patients with some chronic progressive illnesses other than cancer, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic lung diseases, and heart failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F91823\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91823 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review of studies of symptom prevalence in people with incurable disease, the pooled prevalence of cough was 28 percent in 24 studies involving almost 12,000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another review of 109 palliative care patients (49 with cancer and 60 with COPD) noted cough in 78 percent of the cancer patients and 62 percent of those with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough is also a prominent feature of patients with progressive fibrotic lung disease; in one report, cough was reported in 42 of 45 (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 115 patients hospitalized with late-stage nonmalignant disease (61 with organic brain disease, 31 with COPD, 17 with chronic kidney disease, 14 with heart failure, 12 with cirrhosis, and 20 with multiple illnesses), cough was present in 81 percent and was one of the four leading symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HIV infection, cough occurs in 19 to 60 percent, and chronic phlegm production occurs in 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

The assessment should include the type of cough <span class=\"nowrap\">(productive/nonproductive),</span> trigger factors, whether cough is nocturnal or daytime, severity of cough (especially whether sleep is impaired), and effects on quality of life. The timing of the start of cough is important; any change in cough or new cough since the diagnosis of cancer indicates that the cough is likely related to the cancer. On the other hand, a more chronic cough may be related to underlying respiratory morbidity. The assessment should include a careful medication review. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may cause cough, and some chemotherapy drugs cause pulmonary toxicity, which may manifest as cough. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-cytotoxic-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Cytotoxic agents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-toxicity-associated-with-antineoplastic-therapy-molecularly-targeted-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary toxicity associated with antineoplastic therapy: Molecularly targeted agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A bedside swallowing evaluation may be indicated if patients are noted to cough after swallowing. If abnormal, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallowing study can assist with identifying aspiration.

As noted above, the decision to pursue diagnostic studies must be individualized. A general rule for palliative care patients is that a diagnostic test should be performed only if it will yield information that will affect management. (See <a href=\"#H457216021\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.) </p><p>A reasonable palliative care management strategy is to treat empirically, based upon an assessment of the most likely cause (if treatment is consistent with the goals of care), and pursue diagnostic testing only if there is no response and there is a reasonable likelihood of identifying a potentially treatable cause. Symptomatic treatment should be provided alongside disease-modifying treatment. An algorithmic approach to assessment and management of chronic or persistent acute cough in palliative care patients is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F93222\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93222 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457216321\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105887681\"><span class=\"h3\">Potentially reversible causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the palliative care setting, many underlying causes will not be able to be reversed. However, some of the causes of cough are reversible, even in patients with far advanced disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed history may reveal easily resolvable issues, such as exposure to perfumes, a recent medication change (especially the institution of treatment with an ACE inhibitor), or a new infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are distinct treatments for many of the underlying causes of cough, such as antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, anticholinergic decongestants to dry mucus, antacids or proton pump inhibitors for GERD, and corticosteroids for inflammation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobials may be the best therapy to treat the symptoms caused by an infection. Even in patients with chronic infection, such as those with cystic fibrosis, the vast majority are receiving intravenous antipseudomonas antibiotics during the terminal phase of their illness for &ldquo;mixed therapeutic and palliative intent&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Many clinicians utilize oxygen, intermittent positive pressure breathing, and mechanical ventilation for these patients near the end of life as well, given that the timing of death is difficult to predict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For other patients with chronic infection, chronic suppressive antibiotics may not clear the infection but may improve cough.

The following conclusions were drawn:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eight of the 11 comparisons of opioids with placebo for treatment of chronic cough (including eight trials in which the comparator arm was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>, one dihydrocodeinone, one <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, and one viminol p-hydroxybenzoate) showed opioids to be more effective than placebo for decreasing cough frequency and severity and for improving quality of life.

Compared with placebo, the effect sizes for cough severity and rate ratios for cough frequency for nondextromethorphan opioids were 0.55 (95% CI 0.38-0.72) and 0.57 (95% CI 0.36-0.91), respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Four of the six trials comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a> (an antitussive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the major ingredient in most over-the-counter cough syrups) with placebo showed that dextromethorphan was effective at reducing cough severity, frequency, or both.

For patients with cancer, stridor can occur with squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx, trachea, or esophagus. In addition, superior sulcus tumors of the right upper lobe (the so-called &ldquo;Pancoast&rdquo; tumors) can extrinsically compress the superior vena cava (SVC) leading to SVC syndrome. This and other causes of SVC syndrome cause secondary interstitial edema of the head and neck, which may narrow the lumen of the nasal passages and larynx, and cause dyspnea, stridor, cough, hoarseness, and dysphagia.

Pulmonary hemorrhage is a known complication of the antiangiogenic agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, especially in patients with squamous cell bronchogenic carcinoma. The use of bevacizumab is contraindicated in patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma and in any patient with hemoptysis (&gt;2.5 mL of blood) within three months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicity-of-molecularly-targeted-antiangiogenic-agents-non-cardiovascular-effects#H1651227415\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicity of molecularly targeted antiangiogenic agents: Non-cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary hemorrhage and cavitation'</a>.)</p><p>Although hemoptysis is common in bronchogenic carcinoma, massive terminal hemoptysis (eg, from erosion of the tumor into a blood vessel) is rare, occurring in only 3 percent of 877 patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. When it does occur, massive hemoptysis associated with bronchogenic carcinoma has an extremely grim prognosis (mortality 59 to 100 percent), making it a palliative care emergency. Other causes of massive hemoptysis are bronchiectasis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and fungal pulmonary infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-causes#H11003737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Causes&quot;, section on 'Causes of massive hemoptysis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2990465\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoptysis, even of small amounts, may be extremely frightening for the patient and those who watch. At one end of the spectrum, the distress from a bit of blood-flecked sputum associated with cough may be relieved by reassurance. At the other extreme, if hemoptysis is massive, it may herald a life-ending event, and witnessing what may be exsanguination requires urgent attention to all who are witnesses. </p><p>Treatment should be tailored to the patient&rsquo;s overall status, the severity of hemoptysis, the underlying cause, and the wishes of the patient and family. The patient and family can often be best supported by the provision of goal-directed information and recommendations for management. It may be necessary to share prognostic information quickly with the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family to help them determine the best goals of care and, subsequently, the best medical decisions. Using a team approach, psychosocial and spiritual needs can be addressed just as quickly as the physical symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The palliative treatment of hemoptysis is primarily related to managing the patient and family&rsquo;s experience, and efforts to stop the bleeding, if this is consistent with the overall goals of care. At a minimum, reassurance when the amount of blood is small is all that is required. Dark towels, dark sheets, dark blankets, and absorptive dressings with an impermeable backing can be used to diminish the visual impact. The environment can be managed by assuring that blood-tinged sputum is not collecting in a visible white cup at the bedside and that brilliant red-streaked blood on white tissues is kept from view.</p><p>Patients with massive hemoptysis should be immediately placed into a position in which the presumed bleeding lung is in the dependent position (eg, a patient whose right lung is bleeding should be placed in the right-side down decubitus position). The purpose of these positions is to protect the nonbleeding lung, since spillage of blood into the nonbleeding lung may prevent gas exchange by blocking the airway with clot or filling the alveoli with blood. </p><p>In the rare instances where the underlying cause can be reversed, diagnostic tests (bronchoscopy and, if an endobronchial lesion is not identified, angiogram to identify a feeder vessel that might be amenable to bronchial artery embolization [embolotherapy] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]) and interventional procedures may be considered, if this is consistent with the goals of care. For patients with massive hemoptysis, this might require urgent supportive care with blood or platelet transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, and administration of procoagulant agents. Radiotherapy in a single dose may stop bleeding of a malignant source if the patient is stable enough for imaging and planning. Therapeutic bronchoscopy with balloon tamponade and infusion of vasoactive agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, may be successful as a temporizing measure. Antifibrinolytics given orally or via nebulized routes have been used, but utility is guided mostly by anecdote and some small case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. One case series suggests nebulized vasopressin could be effective for mild to moderate hemoptysis in palliative care patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. If the area of bleeding can be directly visualized, bronchoscopic techniques such as laser coagulation or electrocautery may also be used, with response rates of 60 to 100 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-massive-hemoptysis#H2767250\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of massive hemoptysis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management#H7235390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Nonsurgical'</a>.) </p><p>If hemoptysis is overwhelming <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accompanied by severe hemodynamic instability and the goals of care do not support attempts at diagnosis or intervention, urgent sedation may be required. When urgent sedation is required, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> at 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered intravenously (if there is vascular access) or subcutaneously will be effective in the patient who is not chronically taking benzodiazepines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F88423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88423 \">table 4</a>). This is generally administered in 5 mg increments every five minutes until sedation is achieved. A continuous infusion may be instituted to maintain sedation. </p><p>For the patient who is tolerant to benzodiazepines, an alternative agent, such as a barbiturate, will be effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F88423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88423 \">table 4</a>). For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> may be administered in a loading dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intramuscularly. Because of the relatively low concentration (it is available in 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> vials), splitting of the total dose into two or three syringes with administration into separate intramuscular sites may be required because of volume constraints. If sedation is not achieved, the loading dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> can be repeated every two hours to a maximum of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> total in the first 24 hours. If phenobarbital is administered intravenously, the rate should not exceed 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/minute</span>. After sedation is achieved, a continuous infusion of 10 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> can be instituted. A total dose of 600 to 2400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (25 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span> is often sufficient to sustain sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-sedation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative sedation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369324\"><span class=\"h3\">Guidelines from expert groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines are available for symptom management in patients with lung cancer from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-overview-of-cough-stridor-and-hemoptysis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

In most cases, diagnostic testing should only be pursued if it will yield information that will affect management. (See <a href=\"#H457216021\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378021391\"><span class=\"h2\">Cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In palliative care populations, asthenia, muscle weakness, and the inability to coordinate an effective swallow near the end of life result in ineffective, persistent coughing in an attempt to clear accumulating airway secretions. Among patients with cancer, cough may be attributed to direct or indirect effects of the tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F91822\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91822 \">table 1</a>). All patients should be evaluated for other potentially treatable causes of cough. </p><p>The following represents our approach to treatment, which is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F93222\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93222 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potentially reversible causes should be sought (eg, exposure to an inhaled irritant, postnasal drip, infection, inflammation, new medication), for which specific treatment may be available. (See <a href=\"#H105887681\" class=\"local\">'Potentially reversible causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cancer who have airway obstruction, palliative chemotherapy, palliative radiotherapy, laser treatment, or stent placement may provide symptomatic improvement, if such treatments are consistent with the goals of care. However, improvement with chemotherapy, palliative radiotherapy, and endobronchial brachytherapy may take several weeks. (See <a href=\"#H378021192\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric treatment of cough is appropriate when a specific cause cannot be identified or when cause-directed therapy is neither feasible nor rapidly effective. Symptomatic management should be provided alongside disease-modifying treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with moderate to severe cough, particularly those with malignancy-related cough, we recommend treatment with a centrally acting opioid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1337957294\" class=\"local\">'Patients with moderate to severe cough'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is little reason to choose one agent over any other. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Codeine</a>, 15 mg orally every four hours; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a>, 5 mg every four hours; or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, 5 mg every four hours, are reasonable starting doses in an opioid-na&iuml;ve patient. For patients already receiving opioids for pain, a 25 to 50 percent dose increase may be tried to suppress the cough. (See <a href=\"#H457216555\" class=\"local\">'Centrally acting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are refractory to opioids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzonatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzonatate</a> may be tried in conjunction with an opioid. (See <a href=\"#H457216561\" class=\"local\">'Peripherally acting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative to opioids for patients with chronic unexplained cough and a contraindication to opioids or another reason to avoid opioids is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H457216555\" class=\"local\">'Centrally acting'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild-severity cough, we try nonpharmacologic therapies first (eg, cough suppression exercises, linctus [honey or a demulcent cough syrup]). If cough continues or worsens, we begin a peripherally acting antitussive, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzonatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzonatate</a>, switching to a centrally acting antitussive, such as an opioid, if cough continues or worsens. (See <a href=\"#H378021192\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selected patients may benefit from other pharmacologic strategies, such as bronchodilators (if there is a bronchoconstrictive component to the cough), glucocorticoids (if there is an inflammatory component), or an expectorant (if the sputum is thick and the patient is able to cough out liquified mucus). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H474363977\"><span class=\"h2\">Stridor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stridor is a harsh, high-pitched wheezing or vibrating sound that results from a narrowing of a central airway or the larynx caused by a foreign body, a tumor pushing extrinsically or growing intrinsically, infection, or edema. The degree of obstruction or narrowing and the rapidity of onset can precipitate a palliative care emergency. (See <a href=\"#H2990458\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and underlying causes'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who present with stridor due to severe tracheal or mainstem obstruction or severe laryngeal edema and respiratory compromise represent a true medical emergency; they require initial stabilization to secure ventilation and oxygenation. (See <a href=\"#H474363999\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dyspnea and anxiety should be managed with opioids and benzodiazepines. For highly symptomatic patients, sedation may be required to relieve distress to the satisfaction of the patient and family. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-sedation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative sedation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once initial control of the symptom is achieved, attention to the underlying cause can be entertained. Prudent imaging, either radiographically or endoscopically, may lead to more definitive therapy (eg, palliative radiotherapy, stenting). (See <a href=\"#H2990465\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369050\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoptysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoptysis, blood coughed up from a pulmonary source, must be differentiated from pseudohemoptysis (expectoration of blood originating in the nasopharynx or oropharynx) and hematemesis.
