The approach to a patient with a mediastinal mass will be reviewed here, including planning the diagnostic workup as well as initial therapy. In addition, a brief overview of the most common causes of mediastinal masses is presented. Detailed discussions of those pathologic processes are presented separately, as noted below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H658064581\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1259249239\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidental finding on imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mediastinal mass can be an incidental finding in patients who undergo plain chest radiography or advanced imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. These may have been obtained prior to elective surgery or as part of the evaluation of an unrelated condition.</p><p>Findings on the chest radiograph can vary from subtle mediastinal findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50767\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50767 \">image 1</a>) to the presence of a widened mediastinum or large mass in the mediastinum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90484\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90484 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98070056\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms, if present, may be due to direct mass effect of the mediastinal anomaly or to systemic effects of the illness. In general, malignant lesions are more likely to be symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mediastinal mass effects &ndash; Direct involvement or compression of normal mediastinal structures cause a wide range of symptoms. These can include cough, stridor, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, pain, dysphagia, hoarseness, facial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper extremity swelling due to vascular compression (eg, superior vena cava syndrome), hypotension due to tamponade physiology or cardiac compression, and Horner syndrome due to sympathetic chain involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic effects &ndash; Systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss can be present in the case of lymphoma or may be due to a variety of paraneoplastic syndromes, such as myasthenia gravis with thymoma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10634591\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESUMPTIVE CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of a suspected mediastinal mass consists of a thorough history and physical examination, supplemented by laboratory and imaging studies. A combination of these, particularly the location of the mass, often helps narrow the possibilities when a mediastinal mass is detected on imaging. Laboratory studies or blood tumor markers can also help support a specific diagnosis. In some instances, these are enough for a presumptive diagnosis to guide therapy. As an example, the presence of a large anterior mediastinal mass and elevations in certain tumor markers can very reliably establish the diagnosis of some germ cell tumors. In other cases, a tissue biopsy (percutaneous, endobronchial, surgical) may be necessary to confirm a clinical suspicion prior to establishing a therapeutic plan. (See <a href=\"#H3598114789\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1883747463\" class=\"local\">'Tissue diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16466231\" class=\"local\">'Germ cell tumor'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16465724\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should carry out a comprehensive history and physical examination while focusing on the symptoms and signs that are more often associated with mediastinal masses. (See <a href=\"#H98070056\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>Reviewing the time course of the development of symptoms can help narrow the list of potential diagnoses. Mediastinal processes can undergo slow growth over the course of years (eg, thymoma in some patients) or rapid expansion (eg, lymphoma). Mediastinal masses can also be associated with abnormalities in other parts of the body (eg, testicular masses with germ cell tumors); thus, the history should include a thorough review of systems and should not be narrowed to questions related to the mediastinum. Thymomas can be associated with certain paraneoplastic disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-management-of-thymoma-and-thymic-carcinoma#H1353927045\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and management of thymoma and thymic carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Paraneoplastic disorders'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, the physical examination should not be solely focused on areas directly related to the mediastinum. Rather, a complete physical examination is needed, which includes examination of the head, neck, upper extremity, chest, and abdomen but also examination of all areas that could demonstrate lymphadenopathy, as well as a scrotal examination in males.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16465975\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor markers can support a presumptive diagnosis in some instances of anterior mediastinal masses. Tumor markers are most helpful when thymoma or germ cell tumor is suspected. In general, the following laboratory tests are reasonable to routinely check for patients in whom a diagnosis has not already been established.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies &ndash; This may be positive in some patients with thymic tumors and indicate or herald the presence of myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"#H16466089\" class=\"local\">'Thymic mass'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) &ndash; Elevated levels of AFP are found in malignant germ cell tumors; specifically, 60 to 80 percent of nonseminomatous dysembryomas are serum AFP positive. (See <a href=\"#H16466231\" class=\"local\">'Germ cell tumor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) &ndash; Beta-HCG is associated with seminoma (10 percent) and nonseminomatous (30 to 50 percent) germ cell tumors. (See <a href=\"#H16466231\" class=\"local\">'Germ cell tumor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &ndash; LDH may be elevated in patients with nonseminomatous dysembryoma, though this laboratory finding is generally not as specific as AFP or beta-hCG. Additionally, LDH may be elevated in patients with lymphoma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H682160911\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast is typically used to evaluate abnormalities seen on plain radiographs. In many cases, no further imaging beyond the CT is needed to evaluate the mediastinal mass.</p><p>Chest CT can confirm the presence of a mediastinal mass, and, on occasion, an abnormality that was thought to be a mediastinal mass is determined to be something else. Chest CT also provides detailed information regarding the mediastinal abnormality, including its location, size, relationship to other structures, and tissue characteristics, including presence of fat, fluid, or calcifications (eg, teratoma). Such detailed information, particularly involvement or compression of surrounding structures, is critical in planning treatment and preparing a patient for possible resection. (See <a href=\"#H4110057755\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Other imaging studies can be useful for diagnostic purposes or treatment planning in select instances. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac gated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging &ndash; MR is useful in distinguishing compression versus invasion, particularly in cases of large anterior mediastinal masses where this distinction can be difficult on CT, even when using intravenous contrast. (See <a href=\"#H16466078\" class=\"local\">'Anterior mediastinum'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) &ndash; For a mediastinal mass that is suspected to be a lymphoma, using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with fused CT may be performed. This modality can be useful to identify a preferred biopsy site. For tumors found to be PET avid on initial study, it can be useful in monitoring response to treatment. However, it is important to note that FDG-PET imaging can be misleading because nonmalignant conditions such as teratoma and thymic cysts have been shown to have FDG accumulation in 14 to 42 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, normal thymus has been shown to have a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.00 to 2.09, and thymic rebound has also been observed, where patients treated with chemotherapy for another malignancy have been found to have increased PET activity with a mean SUV of 2.89 at a mean interval of 10 months after chemotherapy completion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16466296\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest or spine MR &ndash; These provide a detailed evaluation of posterior mediastinal masses that are adjacent to the spine. MR is better than CT for determining whether a mass extends into the neural foramina or spinal canal, which is important for surgical planning. (See <a href=\"#H16466385\" class=\"local\">'Posterior mediastinum'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technetium scan &ndash; For a mediastinal mass that is suspected to be ectopic thyroid tissue or a substernal goiter, a technetium scan be used to confirm this suspicion. (See <a href=\"#H16466089\" class=\"local\">'Thymic mass'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>[<sup>131</sup>I] meta-iodobenzylguanidine &ndash; This study is useful for confirming the presence of a mediastinal pheochromocytoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scrotal ultrasound &ndash; For a mediastinal mass that is suspected or proven to be a germ cell tumor, ultrasound should be performed to exclude a gonadal primary tumor. (See <a href=\"#H16466231\" class=\"local\">'Germ cell tumor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1883747463\"><span class=\"h1\">TISSUE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis generally requires a tissue sample, which can be obtained either by biopsy prior to treatment or as part of a planned therapeutic resection of the entire mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3173061148\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy is needed to confirm a suspected diagnosis in some but not all cases prior to definitive treatment. Duplication cysts do not require biopsy, if imaging clearly demonstrates a cystic lesion without any soft tissue abnormality that could represent the presence of a neoplasm. Whatever biopsy method is used (percutaneous, endobronchial, surgical), pathology should confirm that adequate diagnostic tissue has been obtained, either by cytological assessment or frozen section. The use of rapid on-site cytological examination (ROSE) has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield of transbronchial biopsies from 65 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If necessary, additional biopsies should be performed while the patient is still sedated or anesthetized so the patient does not have to go through repeated diagnostic procedures.</p><p>The decision to biopsy can be difficult when a patient clearly has a resectable anterior mediastinal mass but the clinical scenario does not allow definitive distinction between lymphoma or thymoma. Confirming the diagnosis when lymphoma is suspected with biopsy is preferred. The risk of forgoing biopsy and not obtaining a pre-resection diagnosis is the possibility that the surgeon will resect a lymphoma that could have been managed with nonsurgical treatment. On the other hand, biopsy (percutaneous, endobronchial, surgical) of an encapsulated thymoma can cause tumor seeding. Although this situation is likely rare, multiple case reports have demonstrated needle tract and chest wall seeding after thymoma biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and seeding of either the mediastinal space, the pleura, or the needle tract can create a situation where surgery is no longer curative without adjuvant radiation. An even more disastrous situation is when tissue biopsy causes seeding of the pleural cavity, which changes a curable situation into one in which the patient remains at risk for pleural recurrence throughout <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> lifetime. Guidance regarding the decision between biopsy and surgical resection is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4110057755\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> below.)</p><p>For a posterior mediastinal mass, a pre-resection biopsy is pursued if a diagnosis has not been established by clinical presentation and imaging, the mass involves structures considered not resectable, or the mass appears resectable but the resection would be extensive and require complex reconstruction. These are most often neurogenic tumors or sarcomas, which can generally be sampled using computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy. Those patients who are appropriate candidates for upfront surgical resection are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4110057755\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Occasionally, an adequate tissue diagnosis is elusive in spite of adequate attempts at biopsy. As an example, in nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma, the abnormal tissue can be dominated by fibrosis with a paucity of the cells that are needed to firmly establish the diagnosis. In these situations, a reasonable approach is to obtain a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and proceed with a biopsy of the most metabolically active area on PET by whatever approach allows the best access to that area. If the biopsy is still not completely diagnostic, further treatment must proceed based on the most likely diagnosis considering clinical, imaging, and pathologic characteristics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2572676474\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both anterior and posterior mediastinal masses can often be biopsied under CT guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The diagnostic yield of percutaneous biopsy of mediastinal masses is 74 to 77 percent, with a rate of up to 100 percent for thymic neoplasms, but a nondiagnostic result occurs in 75 percent of patients ultimately found to have lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Core needle biopsies rather than fine needle aspiration should be obtained whenever possible, as fine needle aspiration often will not allow differentiation among the possible diagnoses. One study has shown that core biopsy had a diagnostic yield of 77 percent, compared to a diagnostic yield of only 60 percent for fine needle aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Core biopsy can be inadequate when tissue is needed for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis, particularly in subtyping malignancies such as lymphoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1241215406\"><span class=\"h3\">Endobronchial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endobronchial biopsy (EBUS) is reasonable to consider when the mediastinal mass is located immediately adjacent to an airway. Lesions in these locations are often difficult to access percutaneously even with radiographic imaging guidance due to the proximity of major vascular structures. Using EBUS to guide biopsy can significantly increase the potential yield of this diagnostic procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-associated-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-procedures#H1028221175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Associated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures&quot;, section on 'Transbronchial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1163355437\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When percutaneous or endobronchial biopsy is not possible or cannot provide adequate tissue to definitively establish a diagnosis, surgical biopsy may be necessary.</p><p>As an example, when lymphoma is considered a possibility based on the clinical scenario, excisional biopsy of a small mass, if possible, or incisional biopsy of a large mass is preferred, although in select cases large core needle biopsies may be adequate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13483153\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Type of biopsy'</a>.).</p><p>Surgical options for obtaining a tissue sample are described below. Assessment of the adequacy of the biopsy samples should be carried out with frozen section. Minimally invasive approaches (eg, mediastinoscopy, video-assisted thoracoscopy) can be tried prior to resorting to open surgical approaches.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior mediastinotomy (ie, Chamberlain procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90485\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90485 \">figure 1</a>)) may be appropriate for lesions that are substernal. Anterior lesions typically displace normal structures away from the planned biopsy site, which allows a biopsy to be performed without entering the pleural space, which reduces the risk of postoperative pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and need for a chest tube. An anterior mediastinotomy will almost always yield a sufficient amount of tissue to provide a diagnosis and usually can be done on an outpatient basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-evaluation-of-mediastinal-lymphadenopathy#H412278\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy&quot;, section on 'Anterior mediastinotomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical mediastinoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90487 \">figure 2</a>) is an option for lesions in the middle mediastinum. A mediastinoscope is inserted through a small incision just above the sternal notch and directed into the mediastinum. This approach is effective at obtaining tissue from mediastinal masses that are adjacent to the airway. Lesions in the paratracheal and subcarinal spaces can be safely sampled with this approach. An extended mediastinoscopy that explores other areas adjacent to the great vessels in the middle mediastinum can also be useful but requires an additional level of expertise. Most surgeons opt for another biopsy approach if a standard cervical mediastinoscopy does not provide safe access to the tissue in question. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-evaluation-of-mediastinal-lymphadenopathy#H548647111\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy&quot;, section on 'Mediastinoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Video-assisted thoracoscopy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90719\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90719 \">figure 3</a>) can be performed from either side of the chest. This approach can be associated with more postoperative pain compared with other minimally invasive procedures; however, the excellent anatomic view also allows biopsy of tissue anywhere in the mediastinum, even immediately adjacent structures such as the aorta, other great vessels, or the heart. VATS can be performed on an outpatient basis, but most surgeons insert a chest tube and admit patients overnight. VATS biopsy is generally performed only if another method has failed to achieve diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4110057755\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most appropriate surgical approach for resection of a mediastinal mass depends upon the patient, the location and size of the lesion, the presumptive diagnosis, and the preference and experience of the surgeon performing the resection. Options for surgical resection include minimally invasive approaches (VATS, robotic assisted, transcervical resection) or traditional open approaches (thoracotomy, median sternotomy, thoracosternotomy [clamshell], hemi-thoracosternotomy [hemi-clamshell] incisions). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest proceeding with resection without biopsy in situations where the only imaging abnormality is the mediastinal mass, systemic symptoms typical of lymphoma are not present, and the mediastinal mass is clearly resectable without any suggestion of invasion of local structures on imaging. This strategy may lead to some situations where a patient undergoes resection of a mediastinal lymphoma, but we feel this risk is outweighed by avoiding the more likely situation of potentially worsening the prognosis of a patient with thymoma if the biopsy causes pleural seeding that ultimately causes recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H3173061148\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1495530584\"><span class=\"h3\">Anatomic evaluation and surgical planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unnecessary morbidity can be avoided if involvement of unresectable structures is identified prior to surgery. In addition, anatomic information can help determine if resection is suited to a minimally invasive approach. The surgeon and anesthesiologist should always review the risks of the procedure, particularly with induction of anesthesia. The surgeon should be physically present in the operating room during this critical period. (See <a href=\"#H682160911\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>When resection is planned, the relationship between the mediastinal mass and the superior vena cava and airway must be explicitly examined and reviewed with anesthesia prior to the procedure. If there is any possibility that superior vena cava occlusion or compression could impair delivery of critical intravenous infusions to the heart via upper extremity or neck veins, then lower extremity central venous access via a femoral line must be obtained.</p><p>Induction of anesthesia and establishing an airway can be hazardous when a mediastinal mass is present. Awake fiberoptic intubation with the patient sitting up at an incline is often the safest approach in cases where there are any concerns. Mediastinal masses, particularly anterior masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107836\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107836 \">image 3</a>), can distort the trachea to such an extent that an endotracheal tube cannot be safely passed without direct vision. Induction of anesthesia can also result in a loss of airway and inability to ventilate the patient if the airway collapses under compression from the mass when the patient is relaxed, a situation that may not be recoverable even with cervical tracheostomy. Thus, some surgeons advocate having a rigid bronchoscope immediately available. The mechanical structure of the rigid bronchoscope will allow the airway to be intubated in the distal trachea past the compression, effectively stenting the airway open and allowing jet ventilation through the rigid bronchoscope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The possibility of having extracorporeal support immediately available should be considered in cases where loss of airway or hemodynamic stability is considered a significant risk. This preparation includes having a perfusionist present in the room with a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit or an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit prepared. In these cases, access lines should be placed in the patient's femoral vein and artery prior to administration of any anesthesia. These lines can be quickly converted to the needed CPB or ECMO cannulas in the case of an airway disaster. This precaution can be life-saving, although it is costly and more difficult to coordinate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3436387992\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific surgical approach (open or minimally invasive) depends upon the location and size of the lesion. In general, lesions that can be approached by thoracotomy can also be approached with VATS. Both of these methods involve approaching and resecting the mediastinal mass from one side of the chest. However, the enhanced field of view provided by the thoracoscope with a minimally invasive approach (VATS, robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [RATS]) allows this approach to be used for some anterior mediastinal masses that cross the midline, such as a thymoma. </p><p>The particular approach to resection used for any tumor is primarily driven by the size, location, and nature of the tumor along with the surgeon's experience and expertise. A minimally invasive approach is generally reserved for tumors less than 4 to 5 centimeters in size, although there are no definitive size criteria that preclude an attempt. Many surgeons will <strong>not</strong> use a minimally invasive approach for patients who have received preoperative treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy because of the potential risks associated with inflammation or fibrosis or for a lesion that appears to have infiltrated into surrounding structures. Nevertheless, surgeons with expertise in minimally invasive techniques may choose this approach depending on their overall assessment of the clinical situation. Starting with thoracoscopic exploration may spare a patient the morbidity of a large incision if the tumor proves to be unresectable (eg, unexpected pleural metastases, extension into the heart or the aorta).</p><p>A chest incision is sometimes necessary to assess resectability of a mediastinal tumor, and some patients may receive a chest incision for diagnostic purposes only. </p><p>Most anterior mediastinal masses that cross the midline require sternotomy for exposure; however, a median sternotomy will generally not provide adequate exposure for an anterior mediastinal mass that extends below the level of the pulmonary hilum on either side. If the mass extends into the chest on one side only, a hemi-clamshell incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90498\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90498 \">figure 4</a>) will provide the necessary exposure to achieve a complete resection. If the mass extends below the pulmonary hila on both sides, a full clamshell incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90511 \">figure 5</a>) is usually necessary. Whenever the goal of the operation includes total thymectomy, as is the case in the setting of myasthenia gravis, it is always important to track the cervical limbs of the thymus into the neck. A transcervical approach is another less invasive technique that can be used to perform a thymectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90488 \">figure 6</a>). Complete thymic resection can be achieved with appropriate patient positioning and sternal retraction. In skilled hands, a cervical approach is, arguably, the preferred approach for thymectomy as a treatment for myasthenia gravis, but it is controversial for the resection of small masses. Thymomas, in particular, have a reputation for seeding if the capsule is violated, and any concern that this might occur should serve as a reason to use a different approach. However, the pleural spaces are usually not violated in the transcervical approach, and patients do not require a chest tube as is the case with other minimally invasive approaches.</p><p>A thoracotomy incision is a standard approach for middle and posterior mediastinal masses. A thoracotomy can also be a reasonable approach for an anterior mediastinal mass if the mass is completely contained within one side of the chest and does not cross the midline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3598114789\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2138453355\"><span class=\"h2\">Mediastinal compartments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mediastinum is defined as &quot;the space between the lungs.&quot; The borders of the mediastinum are the thoracic inlet superiorly, the diaphragm inferiorly, the sternum anteriorly, the spine posteriorly, and the pleural spaces laterally.</p><p>The mediastinum is divided into compartments, and this is useful in developing a differential diagnosis when an abnormality is detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90391 \">table 1</a>) as well as when planning techniques for biopsy or resection.

Preoperative biopsy is <strong>not</strong> necessary if the lesion is well circumscribed and the patient does not have systemic symptoms that suggest another diagnosis. Masses that appear to infiltrate surrounding structures are more likely to be malignant, which occurs in 15 percent of thymomas. If the mass infiltrates surrounding structures or the patient has systemic symptoms or other findings that suggest an alternative diagnosis, biopsy should precede definitive resection. It should be emphasized that the clinical scenario described here with an apparent locally invasive tumor is different than that described above where the dangers of tumor seeding with biopsy were discussed in the setting of a mass that was deemed easily surgically resectable.

For patients in whom the only imaging abnormality is an anterior mediastinal mass, systemic symptoms typical of lymphoma are not present, and the mass is clearly resectable without any suggestion of invasion of local structures on imaging, we proceed with resection rather than obtaining pre-resection biopsy. This approach reduces the likelihood of worsening the prognosis of thymoma, at the potential increased risk of unnecessarily resecting a lymphoma. For posterior mediastinal masses, a pre-resection biopsy is obtained if the clinical presentation and imaging has not strongly suggested a diagnosis, the mass involves structures considered not resectable, or the mass appears resectable but the resection would be extensive and require complex reconstruction. (See <a href=\"#H1883747463\" class=\"local\">'Tissue diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for surgical resection include minimally invasive approaches (eg, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS], robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [RATS], transcervical resection) or traditional open approaches (eg, thoracotomy, median sternotomy, thoracosternotomy [clamshell], hemi-thoracosternotomy [hemi-clamshell] incisions). Prior to surgery, advanced imaging studies should be reviewed to plan the surgical and anesthetic approach. Lower extremity central venous access may be needed if the tumor involves the superior vena cava. In addition, alternatives for securing the airway at the time of anesthetic induction may be necessary (fiberoptic bronchoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy) and should be planned for in advance. (See <a href=\"#H4110057755\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129747332\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge William E Cohn, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Lardinois D, Weder W.
