The decision is difficult because, although dialysis effectively treats the signs and symptoms of uremia and fluid overload (some of which may be life threatening), it is a lifelong therapy that is associated with discomfort, inconvenience, and some risk for the patient.</p><p>As a result, dialysis should be started when the benefit from relieving uremic signs and symptoms is thought to outweigh its risk and associated effect on quality of life, but not before this time.</p><p>Preparation for dialysis is integrated into the overall care of the patient with advanced CKD. Ideally, the decision to initiate dialysis is made long after consideration of the patient for kidney transplantation and after the patient has already chosen his or her dialysis modality and has an appropriate, functioning access in place.</p><p>This topic reviews the indications for chronic dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Other issues related to the care of the CKD patient and to options of renal replacement therapy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The indications for acute dialysis are discussed elsewhere.

These factors must be considered together. The GFR can be estimated using either the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. These formulas are used by most clinical laboratories and give similar results at low eGFR ranges.</p><p>Our approach is largely consistent with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the 2014 Canadian Society of Nephrology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the European guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and the 2015 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The indications for starting dialysis are the same for patients starting hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Logistics surrounding the initiation of peritoneal dialysis are unique, however, and are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4829474\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal dialysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Our general approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with eGFR &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m</strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong> &ndash; </strong>We generally do not initiate chronic dialysis for such patients, even when they have possible symptoms related to ESRD. While some symptoms of kidney disease may be present in patients with eGFR &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, they usually can be managed by medical therapy, and dialysis is rarely required. When patients with eGFR &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> present with symptoms of ESRD, other causes should be excluded or treated before considering dialysis. Specific signs and symptoms are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asymptomatic patients with eGFR 5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m</strong><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><strong>&ndash;</strong> We closely follow such patients (eg, monthly)<strong> </strong>for the emergence of ESRD-related signs and symptoms but do not initiate dialysis in the absence of signs or symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with eGFR 5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m</strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> <strong>with signs or symptoms that could be due to ESRD &#9472; </strong>Among such patients, we exclude other causes of signs and symptoms and try to treat medically (ie, without dialysis), if possible, especially if the eGFR is &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> below). We initiate dialysis for those patients whose signs and symptoms are refractory to medical therapy. An important exception is patients who have absolute indications for dialysis, including uremic pericarditis or pleuritis or uremic encephalopathy; such patients should be started on dialysis without delay. (See <a href=\"#H1147970492\" class=\"local\">'Absolute indications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As the eGFR declines below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, patients often develop symptoms of ESRD that no longer can be treated medically and require dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with eGFR &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m</strong><strong><sup>2</sup></strong><strong> &ndash;</strong> We and most other nephrologists initiate dialysis for most patients (who plan to do so) when eGFR is &le;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, regardless of the absence or presence of ESRD-related signs or symptoms. At such a markedly reduced eGFR, most patients will have signs and symptoms, which are difficult to treat medically. Furthermore, we believe that, at this eGFR, the risks of the patient requiring emergent dialysis initiation or having severe complications of ESRD are unacceptably high without elective dialysis initiation. (See <a href=\"#H245495569\" class=\"local\">'Estimated glomerular filtration rate'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Despite the general approach defined above, the decision of when to initiate dialysis remains complex, and there is large variability in the timing of dialysis initiation between patients. This is because uremic symptoms are often vague and nonspecific, and loss of kidney function is highly variable and may occur rapidly.</p><p>The 2012 KDIGO guidelines suggest that dialysis be initiated when there are signs or symptoms attributable to kidney failure (such as serositis, acid-base or electrolyte disorders not easily corrected medically, pruritus), an inability to control volume status or blood pressure, a progressive deterioration in nutritional status that is refractory to dietary interventions, or cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The KDIGO guidelines state that such signs and symptoms often but not invariably occur when the eGFR is between 5 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The 2014 Canadian Society of Nephrology guidelines recommend monitoring and actively treating symptoms when the eGFR declines below 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The guidelines recommend commencing dialysis in asymptomatic patients when the eGFR declines to below 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or when symptoms occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>European guidelines suggest that, in patients with a GFR &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, dialysis should be considered when symptoms are present, while recognizing that the majority of patients will be symptomatic and need to start dialysis with GFR in the range of 6 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The 2015 KDOQI guidelines suggest that the decision to start dialysis should be based on uremic signs and symptoms, evidence of protein-energy wasting, and the ability to medically manage metabolic abnormalities and volume overload and not based upon the level of kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uremia-related signs and symptoms may develop when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> but usually are not disabling until the eGFR is &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Signs and symptoms that provide an indication for dialysis may be classified as absolute (see <a href=\"#H1147970492\" class=\"local\">'Absolute indications'</a> below) or common. (See <a href=\"#H1147970498\" class=\"local\">'Common indications'</a> below.)</p><p>The severity of symptoms varies substantially among patients. Younger patients and patients without other comorbid conditions tend to tolerate lower eGFR levels without developing as many symptoms.</p><p>Among patients who have uremic symptoms despite an eGFR that is consistently &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, a nuclear determination of GFR or a 24-hour urine for measurement of urea and creatinine clearance may be performed in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the GFR. While the GFR estimation equations have been found to be extremely reliable for clinical purposes in the vast majority of patients, occasionally the GFR estimation may not accurately reflect the true GFR. As an example, among patients who have extremely low muscle mass, the eGFR by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) may overestimate the true GFR.

Anorexia, nausea, and weight loss are the most common reasons to initiate dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With declining eGFR, symptoms of anorexia and weight loss are usually the first uremic symptoms to appear. Loss of appetite for meat is a frequent early symptom and sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. In a study of 90 patients with CKD who received no dietary intervention, a direct correlation was noted between the dietary protein intake and the creatinine clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day at a clearance above 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>0.85 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day between 25 and 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>0.70 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day between 10 and 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>0.54 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After development of anorexia and weight loss, patients may then develop early morning nausea, followed by frequent nausea and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evaluation of anorexia and malnutrition requires careful history (including dietary protein intake), physical examination, and laboratory studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the history is very important, it is sometimes difficult to obtain an accurate history about these symptoms. Sometimes, patients and family members realize that anorexia is a key factor in the decision about dialysis, and they may not provide accurate information in order to delay or avoid dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Following the patient&rsquo;s edema-free weight is helpful, especially when followed over a number of months. A decline in serum albumin also signifies worsening nutritional status. Some nephrologists may also follow urinary nitrogen excretion as a marker of protein intake, although this is rarely done in clinical practice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, clinicians must be aware of a number of other potential causes of these symptoms. As an example, diabetic gastroparesis causes similar symptoms and should be diagnosed, evaluated, and treated, if present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic autonomic neuropathy of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of medications that are started at the time of kidney failure may also cause nausea. As an example, iron supplements frequently cause gastric symptoms. Phosphate binders, alkali replacement in the form of sodium citrate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, and some antihypertensive medications may cause nausea. Changing to intravenous iron and alternative phosphate binders and antihypertensive medications may alleviate the nausea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent volume overload &ndash;</strong> Sodium retention worsens as kidney function deteriorates. Volume overload can lead to refractory hypertension and recurring hospital admissions for congestive heart failure. Judicious use of diuretics is often effective in the treatment of volume overload among patients with low eGFR (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Oral therapy'</a>). Diuretics should not be withheld to prevent a rise in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine level. Instead, the patient should be diuresed to euvolemia or at least to a volume status that, in the clinician&rsquo;s judgment, is well tolerated by the patient, and the BUN and serum creatinine level evaluated at this volume status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fatigue and malaise &ndash;</strong> Worsening fatigue and malaise develop as kidney function declines. It is important for the clinician to rule out other causes such as anemia or depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild cognitive impairment &ndash;</strong> Cognitive impairment may develop in older adults as kidney function worsens. It is often useful to ask a patient&rsquo;s spouse or other family member about possible signs of cognitive impairment in the patient since reports from the patient may not be reliable. It is extremely important to exclude progressive dementia in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For such patients, a three- to four-week trial of dialysis may be warranted to see if it improves mental faculties. Alternatively, in the patient with dementia, conservative management of kidney failure without dialysis may be indicated.

Patients may not be able to tolerate large enough oral doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or sodium citrate to reach target serum bicarbonate values.

Hyperphosphatemia usually does not occur until eGFR &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and often occurs close to the need for dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although dietary restriction and phosphate binders are often effective in the prevention of severe hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, their presence increases the rationale for starting dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245495569\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that provides an absolute indication to begin dialysis in the absence of symptoms. Many patients remain relatively asymptomatic despite an eGFR &lt;10 mL <span class=\"nowrap\">min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Usually, such patients have few other comorbid conditions and are relatively young.</p><p>However, although there is no minimum eGFR that defines an absolute need for dialysis, we and most nephrologists initiate dialysis when the eGFR decreases below 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Most patients will be symptomatic at such a low eGFR. However, even in the absence of symptoms, the risk that a sudden and unexpected health event (such as stroke, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, congestive heart failure) will result in emergent dialysis increases at such a low eGFR.</p><p>In general, estimates of GFR provided by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations are adequate for monitoring kidney function in the later stages of CKD, particularly since we do not use the eGFR alone to determine when to begin dialysis. A comparison between estimation equations was provided by one study that included 409 Korean patients starting dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The mean eGFR at the start of dialysis was 7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for the corrected Cockroft-Gault equation, 6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for the MDRD equation, and 5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for the CKD-EPI equation. The mean eGFR calculated by the corrected Cockroft-Gault equation showed the lowest coefficient of variation.</p><p>The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study, which was the only randomized, controlled trial that examined mortality related to the time of dialysis initiation, found no difference in survival between early or late initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, 828 patients with an eGFR between 10 and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation) were randomly assigned to dialysis initiation when the eGFR was either 10 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This corresponded to approximately 8 to 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for the early-start group versus 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for the late-start group using the MDRD equation. The median time to the initiation of dialysis was 1.8 and 7.4 months in the early- and late-start groups, respectively. At a median follow-up period of 3.6 years, there was no significant difference between groups in survival (38 and 37 percent mortality; hazard ratio [HR] 1.05 with early initiation, 95% CI 0.83-1.30) or in cardiovascular events, infections, or dialysis complications.</p><p>However, these results do not imply that the initiation of dialysis can be delayed until the GFR is between 5 and 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> in all patients. The design of the IDEAL study permitted clinicians to initiate dialysis based upon the presence of uremic symptoms and volume overload as well as on the eGFR. As a result, 76 percent of patients assigned to the late-start arm initiated dialysis when the GFR was greater than 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. This resulted in a mean GFR of 9.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> with the MDRD formula) at the start of dialysis for the late-start group, which was only 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> less than the mean start GFR for the early group (12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> with the MDRD formula). Thus, approximately 88 percent of all enrolled patients had initiated dialysis with an eGFR of approximately 7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (MDRD) or more, either because of symptoms or enrollment in the early dialysis arm.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that the majority of patients will develop uremic symptoms soon after the eGFR falls below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245495759\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Attitude of the nephrologist &ndash; </strong>The attitude of the nephrologist strongly influences the time of initiation of dialysis, and there is large variability in individual practices. In a retrospective study of patients starting dialysis in 2006 (n = 83,621) in the US Renal Data System, 16 percent of patients initiated dialysis with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &ge;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 48 percent of patients initiated dialysis with an eGFR of &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Factors associated with early start included physician graduation from nondomestic medical schools and less provider nephrologist experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study of US Renal Data System data showed that dialysis was initiated earlier in some US geographic regions (in order of earlier start of dialysis): Mountain regions, Midwest, Pacific, Mid-Atlantic, South, and New England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One study suggested that salaried nephrologists at Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities were less likely to initiate dialysis among patients with an eGFR &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73m<sup>2</sup> compared with non-VA nephrologists (who usually received increased financial compensation for each dialysis patient). This study could not exclude confounding factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the nephrologist, starting a patient on dialysis at a given eGFR, regardless of symptoms, is often the easiest approach, particularly if the threshold eGFR for dialysis initiation is &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who have a very low eGFR (ie, &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and are not on dialysis require very close follow-up, which is usually labor intensive for the nephrologist. In contrast, the delivery of care in outpatient dialysis units is usually well coordinated and very easy for a nephrologist to administer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Attitudes regarding the initiation of dialysis have changed over time. Previous clinical guidelines supported the decision to initiate patients at a higher eGFR than is generally recommended today [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Older patients &ndash; </strong>There is no evidence that initiating dialysis earlier in older patients is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As in other patient groups, treatment with dialysis versus conservative therapy leads to longer survival, though several studies have shown no survival benefit in older patients with high comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In older patients with many comorbid conditions and decreased quality of life, careful discussions should take place regarding the benefits and hardships of dialysis.

Referral occurs at variable levels of renal function but often late in the course of progressive renal failure, just before or even after the onset of symptomatic uremia. Late referral reflects in part the absence of clear criteria for the initiation of dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, early referral affords the opportunity to assess the rate of progression of kidney disease, to exclude any reversible causes of a declining GFR, and to permit close follow-up and adequate advance dialysis planning. It may also improve patient outcomes. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H114783633\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Referral to nephrologists'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4829474\"><span class=\"h1\">PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of initiation of peritoneal dialysis is a complex decision that requires coordination between the nephrologist, the patient, and the dialysis center that will perform the training. Unlike a permanent hemodialysis access, which is preferably created weeks to months before dialysis is started, a peritoneal dialysis catheter is generally placed only 10 to 14 days before it is used. After the catheter is placed, however, the patient must be trained to perform dialysis, which is difficult to accomplish if he or she is uremic. As a result, among patients who require the acute initiation of chronic dialysis, hemodialysis is often initiated first using a temporary hemodialysis catheter, even if peritoneal dialysis is the preferred modality over the long term. The increasing availability of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (defined as initiation of peritoneal dialysis less than two weeks after peritoneal dialysis catheter is placed) may ultimately change this. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

We initiate dialysis for those patients whose signs or symptoms are refractory to medical therapy.
