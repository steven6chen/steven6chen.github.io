The etiology, clinical manifestations, and evaluation of neonatal pleural effusions are discussed separately.

Affected fetuses often are also diagnosed with hydrops fetalis, as they have collection of fluids in other locations (eg, ascites, skin edema, or pericardial effusion) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate#H35224749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and evaluation of pleural effusions in the neonate&quot;, section on 'Hydrops fetalis'</a>). In severe cases, fetal thoracentesis may have been performed in an attempt to prevent pulmonary hypoplasia in fetuses during the second trimester, and prior to delivery to facilitate neonatal delivery, and if needed, resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In fetuses with hydrops fetalis, ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) has also been used to allow drainage of pleural fluid in the partially delivered and intubated fetus prior to clamping of the umbilical cord, which maintains the fetoplacental circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonimmune hydrops fetalis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration#H31928955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis and management of bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;, section on 'Prenatal management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration#H31928961\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal diagnosis and management of bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;, section on 'Delivery'</a>.)</p><p>For fetuses that are diagnosed with large pleural effusions, the delivery should be planned for a tertiary center with staff capable of resuscitating and managing neonates with respiratory compromise. In the delivery room, the neonatal team should anticipate the needs of the most severely affected patient and be prepared to provide respiratory support that includes intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and removal of fluid by needle aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H605380098\" class=\"local\">'Needle aspiration'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-care-of-hydrops-fetalis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal care of hydrops fetalis&quot;, section on 'Initial resuscitation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, an infant will be born with pleural effusions that were undiagnosed in utero. Many of these infants will be hydropic, which should lead to a strong suspicion of a pleural effusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605380098\"><span class=\"h3\">Needle aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants with respiratory compromise, it may be necessary to drain the pleural effusion by needle aspiration if adequate ventilation is <strong>not</strong> achieved after intubation and the initiation of positive pressure ventilation. Drainage should be performed under sterile conditions with the infant in a supine position using an 18- to 20-gauge intravascular catheter. In this position, because the fluid layers in the posterior chest, the needle should be introduced into the pleural space in the mid axillary line in the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, and directed posteriorly. Placement of a three-way stopcock on the catheter after removal of the needle will facilitate aspiration of the effusion. If the effusions are bilateral, drainage is generally performed initially on the right side because it has a larger lung volume than the left.</p><p>The volume of fluid removed depends upon the volume of the effusion and the size of the infant. It should be enough to restore ventilation and circulation, but not so much as to put the infant at risk of hypovolemia if the fluid reaccumulates rapidly. An aliquot of the aspirated fluid should be sent for diagnostic evaluation including culture. If the fluid appears purulent, or fluid analysis is suggestive of an infectious process, empiric, broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy should be initiated pending culture results. In our center, we generally use a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>, which is typically used to treat neonatal sepsis.

Pericardiocentesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paracentesis may be required in the resuscitation of such infants.</p><p>Once the acute situation has been resolved, the catheter(s) can be removed and monitoring for the possible reaccumulation of the effusion and its potential effect on the infant's cardiovascular status (heart rate, peripheral perfusion, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure) is performed. If there are signs of hypovolemia (tachycardia, poor peripheral perfusion, or hypotension), normal saline should be administered initially as a 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> IV infusion followed by close hemodynamic monitoring. Effusions resulting from hydrops fetalis often do not recur, or do so slowly, and further intervention is often not required. In contrast, those caused by venous obstruction or chylous drainage generally recur and require additional therapy (eg, chest tube drainage). (See <a href=\"#H22118767\" class=\"local\">'Tube thoracostomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605380520\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic/small effusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small effusions or asymptomatic effusions are often detected incidentally by chest radiography. These effusions typically do not cause respiratory or circulatory compromise, and as a result, they can be managed conservatively with observation and without direct intervention. Monitoring includes serial chest radiographs to follow effusion size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resolution, and ongoing cardiorespiratory assessment including respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and periodic measurement of blood gasses to assess the stability of the infant's acid-base status. If there is onset of respiratory distress or deterioration in oxygenation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acid-base status, then intervention including needle aspiration or thoracostomy may be warranted. In cases where infection is suspected, diagnostic thoracentesis also may be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22118760\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PLEURAL EFFUSIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H777247962\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of recurrent and chronic effusions is primarily dependent on the likelihood and rapidity of resolution when the underlying cause is treated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, recurrent effusions caused by hydrops or other nonchylous etiologies can usually be treated with serial needle aspirations over a relatively brief period of time as the underlying condition is treated or spontaneously resolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initially, in patients with persistent effusions, serial chest radiographs and several needle aspirations will establish chronicity and mandate additional therapy. Interventions include tube thoracostomy, chemical pleurodesis, and surgery. Continued and persistent accumulation of large volumes of pleural fluid is usually, but not always, associated with <strong>chylous</strong> pleural effusions. Prolonged drainage of chylothorax may lead to significant losses of fluid, electrolytes, proteins including immunoglobulins, and lymphocytes. Depletion of immunoglobulins and lymphocytes may result in clinically significant immunosuppression. Because of the complexity of management of infants requiring prolonged drainage, we recommend transfer of such infants to tertiary centers with staff who have expertise in the care of these infants. (See <a href=\"#H777249746\" class=\"local\">'Chylous effusions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H777250091\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22118767\"><span class=\"h3\">Tube thoracostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the neonate with a persistent pleural effusion(s) that continues to cause respiratory distress despite serial needle aspirations, placement of a chest tube(s) with underwater seal system can slowly drain pleural fluid on an ongoing basis, resulting in improved respiratory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In neonates, chest tubes in a size range of 10 to 12 FR, or pigtail catheters of 8.5 FR or greater should be used. We prefer pigtail catheters as they seem to remain in place longer. Similar to the insertion site used for needle aspiration, the tube should be inserted under sterile conditions with the infant in the supine position in the mid axillary line in the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> intercostal space and directed posteriorly. The tube should be sutured in place and covered with an airtight occlusive dressing. The distal end is then connected to a closed system calibrated suction device with 10 to 15 cm water negative pressure. Proper position of the tube should be verified with a chest radiograph. Initially, the volume of drainage should be measured every six to eight hours after the initial volume has been drained. As the volume decreases, the measurement interval can be increased. Bilateral chest tube placement may be necessary if the effusions are large on both sides.</p><p>Continued drainage of pleural fluid either by repeated aspiration or chest tube drainage can lead to significant loss of fluid and electrolytes. Chronic loss of chyle also leads to depletion of serum proteins, especially albumin and immunoglobulins, and lymphocytes. (See <a href=\"#H777249746\" class=\"local\">'Chylous effusions'</a> below.)</p><p>In neonates, persistent effusions are rarely due to infectious causes. The management of pediatric parapneumonic effusions and empyema, including the indications for chest tube placement, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of parapneumonic effusion and empyema in children&quot;, section on 'Chest tubes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22118774\"><span class=\"h4\">Volume and electrolyte loss management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant volume and electrolyte loss can occur with chronic chest tube drainage. The electrolyte content of pleural effusions is similar to that of plasma. Thus, large amounts of water and electrolytes (especially sodium) can be lost with ongoing drainage. Daily assessments of weight and electrolytes are therefore essential in the early management of continuous chest tube output. The need for replacement of losses will depend on the magnitude of the losses and changes in serum electrolytes. The decision to replace lost volume depends on the infant's daily fluid and electrolyte intake. Volume loss should be calculated every 8 to 12 hours and, if indicated, replacement with normal saline or other appropriate solution should be given intravenously over one to two hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22118837\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleurodesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleurodesis is a procedure that obliterates the pleural space to prevent a recurrent pleural effusion following pleural drainage. After draining the effusion, a chemical irritant that induces inflammation and fibrosis is instilled into the pleural space (ie, chemical pleurodesis). Various agents have been used for chemical pleurodesis. Many of these, especially chemotherapeutic agents, are contraindicated in neonates and young infants because of potential toxicities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemical pleurodesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Data are limited in infants and include case reports, primarily in patients with persistent chylous effusions, using the following agents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iodopovidone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Tetracycline</a> derivatives (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">doxycycline</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrin glue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> A3 (OK-432) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]</p><p/><p>The use of these agents need further study to determine efficacy and safety in the treatment of neonatal pleural effusions.

However, it appears based on retrospective data from large case series that comprehensive management with ventilatory support, dietary management focused on decreasing thoracic duct lymph flow (parenteral nutrition and the use of medium-chain triglycerides), and the use of pharmacologic agents (somatostatin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a>) have improved the outcome of neonates with chylothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>In the largest case series of 178 infants, 172 were initially managed medically with chest tube drainage, nutritional measures (eg, medium-chain triglycerides enteral feeding, total parental feeds, and withholding of feeds), and for 45 patients, pharmacologic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> (synthetic somatostatin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In another retrospective study of 11 neonates with chylous effusions and congenital diaphragmatic hernia, resolution of effusions was observed in all patients regardless of treatment, which in five cases included TPN and thoracostomy, and in the remaining six cases, the addition of octreotide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, in the previously mentioned large case series, there was no observed additional benefit of octreotide to <span class=\"nowrap\">NPO/TPN</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Significant adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> have been reported in neonates treated for chylothorax and other conditions (eg, congenital hyperinsulinism, and enterocutaneous fistula). These include persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/3,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,42</a>], and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].</p><p>In summary, data remain uncertain on whether or not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> is beneficial in the management of chronic chylothorax that is resistant to dietary management. In addition, there are significant adverse outcomes, and its use in the treatment of chylothorax has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a result, the use of octreotide should be reserved for refractory cases and should only be instituted after a thorough discussion with the parent(s) or legal guardian of the infant regarding the uncertainty of risk and benefits.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Octreotide</a> can be given subcutaneously or intravenously.

Because octreotide blunts insulin release, close monitoring of serum glucose values should be performed during the induction phase with spacing of measurements as a stable infusion rate is achieved.

In patients who continue to be symptomatic, needle aspiration is repeated two or three times until it is clear that the effusion(s) will either clear or continue. Pleural fluid is sent for analysis and culture. Empiric antibiotic therapy is started in patients for whom infection is suspected as a cause of the effusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-pleural-effusions-in-the-neonate#H605378660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and evaluation of pleural effusions in the neonate&quot;, section on 'Further diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic effusions, defined as those requiring repeated needle aspirations to relieve respiratory distress, are drained with pigtail catheters. After initial chest radiographs confirm appropriate chest tube placement, they are repeated only if there is increased respiratory distress or a sudden decrease in output occurs. We monitor chest tube output and serum electrolytes frequently, and replace volume and adjust electrolyte infusions as needed. (See <a href=\"#H22118767\" class=\"local\">'Tube thoracostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the effusion is chylous, the following step-wise approach is used:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Our initial intervention is the use of a formula with a high concentration of medium-chain triglycerides. If drainage of chyle continues for more than a week, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) and nothing by mouth is tried. However, we prefer if possible to continue enteral feeds due to the long-term complications of TPN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> is provided if drainage and dietary management, including TPN, fail to reduce chest tube output after a week to 10 days. In this rare setting, we begin with 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per hour and increase the infusion rate by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per hour per day until a response is noted or the infusion rate reaches a maximum of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per hour. A positive response is considered to be at least a 25 percent reduction in output. Once a response is obtained, we usually continue infusion at the same rate for 7 to 10 days before beginning a slow wean over another week. If chest tube drainage increases, we increase the octreotide infusion rate and maintain it for at least another week before reweaning. (See <a href=\"#H777249795\" class=\"local\">'Dietary management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H777249802\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If maximal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> dosing does not affect chest tube output after two or three days, we rapidly taper the dose over a day or two, and consider chemical pleurodesis or surgical intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with chylothorax and prolonged drainage, serum albumin, and clotting studies are measured once or twice weekly, and replacement therapy is administered as needed. As discussed previously, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) therapy is considered for patients with hypoimmunoglobulinemia due to severe and prolonged loss.

We continue to monitor the patient for another week or more for recurrence of a pleural effusion.</p><p/><p>In our center, this approach has been successful and we have rarely needed to resort to either chemical pleurodesis or surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115514162\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although neonatal pleural effusions are rare, large effusions can cause significant respiratory distress and compromise.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with congenital pleural effusions are usually diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound, and often also have hydrops fetalis with collection of fluid in other anatomical locations. For fetuses that are diagnosed with large pleural effusions, delivery should be planned for a tertiary center with staff capable of resuscitating and managing neonates with respiratory compromise by providing respiratory support that includes intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and removal of fluid by needle aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H605379980\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic/large effusions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with small asymptomatic effusions are managed conservatively with monitoring of the respiratory status of the infant, which includes serial chest radiography and ongoing cardiorespiratory assessment (eg, oxygen saturation, respiratory and heart rate, and blood gases). If there are signs of respiratory deterioration, intervention (eg, needle aspiration) may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H605380520\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic/small effusions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of recurrent and chronic effusions is primarily dependent on the likelihood and rapidity of resolution when the underlying cause is treated. Effusions caused by hydrops or other nonchylous etiologies can usually be treated with serial needle aspirations. However, patients with chylothorax continue to have persistent effusions that generally necessitate further interventions. (See <a href=\"#H777247962\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In neonates who continue to have persistent moderate to large pleural effusions despite serial needle aspirations, we suggest chest tube placement for slow continuous drainage of fluid using an underwater seal system (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Ongoing drainage can be associated with significant losses of water and electrolytes. As a result, daily assessment of weight and electrolytes are needed to determine the need of fluid replacement, including determination of volume and content. (See <a href=\"#H22118767\" class=\"local\">'Tube thoracostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other measures that have been used to treat persistent neonatal pleural effusions include chemical pleurodesis and surgical interventions including mechanical pleurodesis, pleuroperitoneal shunt, and, for patients with chylothorax, ligation of the thoracic duct. However, data are limited and these interventions cannot be routinely recommended for neonates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of infants with chylous effusions by chronic chest drainage is challenging as there are significant losses of fluid, electrolytes, protein including albumin, clotting factors and immunoglobulins, and cellular elements of immunity, particularly lymphocytes. (See <a href=\"#H777249753\" class=\"local\">'Protein loss'</a> above and <a href=\"#H777249781\" class=\"local\">'Lymphocyte depletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In these patients, we suggest the following approach for managing ongoing losses due to ongoing chylous pleural fluid drainage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ongoing monitoring of levels of albumin and immunoglobulin, and clotting studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intravenous (IV) infusion of albumin to maintain serum albumin concentrations above 2 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IV infusion of fresh frozen plasma to correct abnormal clotting studies to below 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with severe hypoimmunoglobulinemia, administration of intravenous immunoglobulin to maintain a threshold level of immunoglobulin of 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.
