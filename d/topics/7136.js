Most young cancer survivors desire to eventually become parents; thus, the psychosocial impact of cancer-related infertility is significant, with a high proportion of these patients experiencing feelings of depression, grief, stress, and sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Concerns about fertility preservation are particularly common among women with gynecologic malignancies. Cervical cancer, in particular, is likely to impact young women; 46 percent of cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in women &lt;45 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These young women may be candidates for fertility preservation options, such as radical trachelectomy, since most of their cancers are diagnosed at an early stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79282 \">table 1</a>) when survival is over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Observational studies published in the past decade have reported good oncologic and obstetric outcomes after this procedure.</p><p>Fertility-sparing surgery for cervical cancer will be discussed here. Additional issues related to fertility and cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility and pregnancy outcome in cancer survivors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576932\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radical hysterectomy is the standard surgical treatment for women with cervical cancer. In general, women with stage IA1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79282 \">table 1</a>) disease may be treated with conization (or extrafascial hysterectomy). However, some other women are candidates for fertility-sparing surgery. These include women of reproductive age with early-stage disease (stage IA2 or IB1) who have no features of disease that are high risk for recurrence (ie, lesion size &gt;2 cm, lymph node metastases). Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) within the tumor is a risk factor for lymph node recurrence, but as a sole finding, it is not a contraindication for fertility-sparing surgery. Options for fertility-preserving surgery include conization and radical trachelectomy (removal of the cervix and surrounding tissues with conservation of the uterus).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468436\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGE IA1 WITHOUT VASCULAR INVASION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Conization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with stage IA1 disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79282 \">table 1</a>) without lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) are candidates for treatment with cervical cold knife conization alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A United States study of data from a national cancer database study (n = 1409) of women age &le;40 years with stage IA1 cervical cancer found no significant difference in five-year survival between those who underwent conization versus hysterectomy (98 versus 99 percent); data regarding LVSI were not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The most common surgical approach in these cases is radical trachelectomy.

This treatment approach is used by some experienced surgeons. Further study of this approach is needed.

However, abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) is gaining popularity. The procedure can also be performed by laparoscopic or robotic surgery. The choice of surgical approach depends upon the expertise of the surgeon, available surgical equipment, and tumor size. In our practice, we use a vaginal approach for lesions &lt;2 cm in diameter. For larger lesions, we use an abdominal approach. Of note, patients with larger lesions have a high likelihood of requiring adjuvant radiation therapy if <span class=\"nowrap\">intermediate-/high-risk</span> features are present on final pathology evaluation. Another alternative is the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a fertility-preserving surgery. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452625\"><span class=\"h3\">Perioperative issues</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452299\"><span class=\"h4\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Criteria for appropriate candidates for vaginal radical trachelectomy (VRT) have remained essentially unchanged since first proposed in 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desire to preserve fertility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reproductive age (most surgeons limit the procedure to women &lt;40 years old, but use in women up to age 45 is acceptable in some cases).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma histology; high-risk histologies should not be present (eg, neuroendocrine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IA1 with LVSI, IA2, or IB1. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesion size &le;2 cm with limited endocervical extension as assessed by colposcopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of lymph node metastasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LVSI within the tumor is a risk factor for lymph node recurrence, but as a sole finding, it is not a contraindication for the trachelectomy.</p><p/><p>Using these criteria, one single-institution study estimated that 40 percent of patients who underwent a radical hysterectomy would have been candidates for a radical trachelectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, even with these selection criteria, in approximately 10 to 12 percent of patients, the procedure must be abandoned in favor of a radical hysterectomy or adjuvant chemotherapy. The criteria for abandoning the procedure are: positive endocervical margin, lesion is larger than anticipated (this is less likely in patients who are evaluated preoperatively with a MRI study), or positive nodes on frozen section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452337\"><span class=\"h4\">Preoperative assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to surgery, MRI of the pelvis is a mandatory examination on all patients who have a macroscopic tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The sagittal T2-weighted images allow a clear assessment of the tumor size and location, degree of extension into the endocervical canal, length of the endocervical canal, and the distance between the upper margin of the lesion and the isthmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The latter measurement is particularly important because in cases where this distance is less than 1 cm, it is our preference to offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) initially and then proceed with the radical trachelectomy in patients with good clinical response. MRI is the best preoperative imaging tool because it allows precise and accurate evaluation of the endocervical tumor extension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes#H10161218\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13452559\"><span class=\"h4\">Use of frozen section</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a visible lesion is present on clinical evaluation, we send the specimen for frozen section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The pathologist is asked to perform the frozen section longitudinally (from the exocervix to the endocervix) at the level of the lesion in order to determine the distance between the upper endocervical tumor margin and the specimen excision margin. Ideally, 8 to 10 mm of normal tissue should be present; otherwise, an additional section of the cervix may need to be removed. If the tumor extends higher into the endocervical canal and the margins remain positive or too close (&lt;5 mm), it may be necessary to perform a complete radical hysterectomy.</p><p>If no visible lesion is present on clinical evaluation (eg, after a diagnostic cone), we prefer to keep the trachelectomy specimen intact for final pathological analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872171701\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal radical trachelectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The VRT procedure uses a transvaginal approach to remove the cervix. It involves an &quot;en-bloc&quot; resection of the cervix along with 1 to 2 cm of vaginal mucosa and proximal parametrial tissue. A permanent cerclage is then placed just superior to the margin, and the neo-cervix is resutured to the vaginal mucosa. It was developed by Professor Daniel Dargent from Lyon, France at the end of the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete laparoscopic lymph node dissection is performed initially to exclude the presence of lymph node metastasis, which would be a contraindication to fertility-sparing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although sentinel node mapping may eventually replace this procedure, its reliability for clinical use in the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer has not been firmly established. A prospective study of 140 women who were candidates for VRT found that approximately 10 percent of planned VRT procedures were abandoned intraoperatively, mainly because of the detection of lymph node metastasis (60 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A detailed, illustrated description of VRT is beyond the scope of this topic, but it is available elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A brief synopsis is provided below. The trachelectomy procedure can be divided into the following six phases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparatory phase &ndash; A 1 to 2 cm cuff of vaginal mucosa around the cervix is delineated and excised. The anterior and posterior edges of the vaginal mucosa are approximated in the midline to cover the cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior phase &ndash; The vesicovaginal space is defined anteriorly to safely mobilize the bladder. The paravesical spaces are then defined laterally; this allows the bladder pillars to be defined. The ureters are palpated and identified within the bladder pillars, which can then be safely excised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior phase &ndash; The posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas) is opened posteriorly, the pararectal space is identified, and the proximal uterosacral ligaments are excised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral phase &ndash; After relocating the ureters, the proximal parametrial tissues are excised at the level of the isthmus. Care is taken to preserve the main uterine artery branches to optimize uterine vascularization in the event of a pregnancy. Although ureteral stents can be used to facilitate identification of the ureters, renal failure secondary to edema of the ureteral orifices has been reported with this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excision &ndash; The trachelectomy specimen is excised approximately 1 cm below the isthmus, followed by endocervical curettage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Closure &ndash; The posterior cul-de-sac is closed with a purse string suture, and a permanent cerclage is placed at the level of the isthmus. The vaginal mucosa is reapproximated to the new exocervix with interrupted sutures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerclage &ndash; The best method of cerclage is controversial. We use a permanent nonresorbable monofilament 0-polypropylene suture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Polypropylene has good tensile strength; the use of a monofilament may reduce the risk of infection. It is important to not place the suture too deep within the cervical stroma to avoid erosion into the endocervical canal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some surgeons prefer Mersilene tape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], but we feel it increases the chance of erosion and infection and does not stretch as much. Dargent used the Saling procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], which results in total cervical occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It does not appear to improve outcome over conventional cerclage and has been associated with additional complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/25,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,29</a>]. We consider it only in patients who failed conventional cerclage procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Techniques for cervical cerclage in women without trachelectomy are discussed separately.

In one of the largest series from a single institution, the perioperative morbidity of laparoscopic-assisted vaginal radical trachelectomy ([LAVRT], n = 118) was compared with that of laparoscopic-assisted vaginal radical hysterectomy ([LAVRH], n = 139) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications were similar for both groups (intraoperative complications 2.5 and 5.8 percent, respectively; postoperative complications 21.2 and 19.4 percent, respectively). Similar results have been reported in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/13,15,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,30</a>]. </p><p>Another study compared VRT with abdominal radical hysterectomy (ARH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. VRT had less operative and short-term morbidity than ARH, but specific long-term morbidity due to the retained uterus and presence of the cerclage was reported (eg, vaginal discharge, irregular bleeding, deep dysmenorrhea, cerclage erosion). In addition, some women who underwent VRT became amenorrheic.</p><p>Ten to 15 percent of patients develop cervical stenosis following VRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some experience dysmenorrhea, hematometra, hematosalpinx, or endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Cervical stenosis can be problematic in women who require assisted reproduction, which may involve intrauterine insemination or embryo transfer following in vitro fertilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].

A review of data from 924 cases from six large series of cervical cancer managed by VRT have been summarized and showed the following pooled rates: recurrence (4.4 percent) and mortality (2.1 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94634 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Approximately 40 percent of recurrences occurred in the parametrium or pelvic sidewall, possibly due to insufficient parametrial excision or to the presence of microscopic LVSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Twenty-five percent of recurrences were in the pelvic, paraaortic, and supraclavicular lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the future, use of sentinel node mapping may help identify potentially missed nodal micrometastasis and aberrant lymph node draining sites, which may explain some of these nodal recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]. Five centropelvic recurrences have been reported; four of these were in patients with adenocarcinomas and may have been due to the multifocal nature of this type of lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>There are no high quality data comparing VRT with radical hysterectomy for treatment of cervical cancer. In a case-control study, 137 women who underwent VRT were matched with radical hysterectomy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Five-year recurrence-free survival rates were similar between groups (95 and 100 percent).</p><p>Risk factors for recurrence include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large lesion size &ndash; Lesions &gt;2 cm are associated with a higher risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/12-14,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14,41</a>]. In one of the large series described above, six of the seven recurrences (86 percent) were associated with tumor size &ge;2 cm; 6 of 21 patients with lesions &ge;2 cm had a recurrence versus only 1 of 62 patients with lesions &lt;2 cm (29 versus 1.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, patients with lesions &gt;2 cm may still be candidates for VRT if their lesion is very exophytic and has minimal stromal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LVSI &ndash; The presence of LVSI is associated with a higher risk of recurrence (12 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although LVSI has been implicated as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], in our experience and that of others, the presence of LVSI alone as a risk factor is not considered an absolute contraindication for VRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/13,14,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,43</a>]. This issue is controversial, and patients with LVSI should be informed of the higher risk of recurrence, particularly when LVSI is extensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsquamous histology &ndash; Adenocarcinomas have not been proven to be associated with a higher risk of recurrence in early-stage disease. A recent large review comparing nearly 3000 squamous with 1000 adenocarcinomas with stage IA1 and IA2 lesions confirms that microinvasive adenocarcinomas have similar outcomes compared with their squamous counterpart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similarly, adenosquamous histology does not appear to significantly increase the recurrence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Cytology reporting post-trachelectomy is challenging, however, as it is often obtained from the lower uterine segment, which may lead to false-positive interpretation. The cytology thus needs to be carefully interpreted by an experienced cytologist. In one study, cytology did not contribute significantly to the diagnosis of cancer recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A follow-up with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may be useful for patients post-trachelectomy.

If medical management is unsuccessful, dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) is another option. In these cases, the cervix should be dilated just enough to allow passage of the suction cannula.

Overall, 42 percent of the pregnancies culminated with the birth of a healthy newborn at term; preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestation occurred in 25 percent, but only about one-half of these deliveries ended with significant prematurity (before 32 weeks). A literature review of 452 pregnancies post-VRT reported that 60 to 75 percent of pregnancies reached the third trimester, and of those, two-thirds delivered at term, with &lt;10 percent delivering with severe prematurity (&lt;32 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rate of preterm birth varies substantially among the different surgical teams performing VRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The technique has been slightly modified from its original version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>Briefly, a midline incision is usually performed. After completing the bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, the paravesical and pararectal spaces are developed. The round ligaments are divided, and then the uterine vessels are divided at their origin from the hypogastric vessels. Care is taken to preserve intact the infundibulopelvic and tuboovarian ligaments, as they will constitute the main source of vascular supply to the uterus. The parametria and paracolpos, along with the uterine vessels, are mobilized with the trachelectomy specimen. A complete ureteral dissection through the parametrial tunnel is required as in a type III radical hysterectomy procedure. The posterior cul-de-sac is incised and the uterosacral ligaments are divided.</p><p>The required length of vaginectomy is then resected circumferentially via an anterior colpotomy, and the specimen is completely separated from the vagina distally. This may be facilitated by the use of a vaginal cylinder to help delineate the vagina. Proximally, the specimen is excised approximately 5 mm below the internal os and is sent for frozen section analysis. If margins are secure, a permanent cerclage is placed circumferentially at the level of the isthmus, although some authors do not place any cerclage at all. The uterine fundus, along with the preserved utero-ovarian ligaments, is inspected for signs of ischemia. Lastly, the lower uterine segment is reanastomosed to the vaginal apex with six to eight interrupted absorbable sutures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H494769\"><span class=\"h4\">Advantages of ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main advantage of the abdominal approach compared with the vaginal approach is a shorter learning curve without the need to acquire skills in laparoscopic and vaginal surgery, nor acquire special instrumentation or training. Because it is similar to the radical hysterectomy procedure, surgeons are more familiar with this approach, which is why it is gaining considerable popularity worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Implementation in developing countries appears safe and feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Wider parametrium can be obtained via the abdominal route compared with the vaginal approach, and as such, the procedure can be offered to patients with larger size lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

They felt the abdominal approach expanded the availability of radical trachelectomy to women with anatomical distortion and to those in whom vaginal access would not be possible. In addition, a small series in which ART was performed during pregnancy reported three of the five patients had a spontaneous miscarriage shortly after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H494775\"><span class=\"h4\">Disadvantages of ART</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disadvantages include the need for a midline laparotomy incision, greater blood loss, longer hospital stay, and sacrifice of the uterine arteries bilaterally, which may cause endometrial atrophy and cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/scarring</span> as well as low birth weight in future pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Morbidity is low, blood loss is minimal, and hospital stay is very short. However, one group reported a high rate of conversion to radical hysterectomy because of inadequate clearing of the endocervical surgical margin, possibly because of difficulty palpating or feeling precisely the lower uterine segment, thus making it more difficult to determine where to amputate the cervix in relation to the level of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

For this reason, we suggest cesarean delivery, which we perform at 37 to 38 weeks of gestation. We usually perform a low transverse incision; others favor a low vertical incision in view of the potential risk of lateral extension into the uterine vessels, but this risk is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/15,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16411709\"><span class=\"h1\">LESIONS LARGER THAN 2 CM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498462\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal radical trachelectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal approach allows for a more extensive parametrial resection, thus suggesting that abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) rather than vaginal radical trachelectomy (VRT) could be performed for women with larger lesion size. Although surgical resection is technically feasible, adjuvant radiation therapy is frequently recommended postoperatively because of intermediate- or high-risk features (size of lesion, depth of stromal invasion, presence of lymphovascular space invasion [LVSI]) identified on final pathology. Unfortunately, radiation therapy results in infertility and premature menopause. As an example, in one series, 60 percent of women either had conversion to a radical hysterectomy or received adjuvant radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. An update of that series indicated fertility loss in 37 percent of patients, higher than following VRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer#H546745501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of early-stage cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant therapy indications'</a>.)</p><p>Three recent series specifically addressed the issue of the abdominal trachelectomy in lesions measuring 2 to 4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. In the series of 29 cases, 45 percent of patients had positive nodes and underwent radical hysterectomy, and 55 percent of node-negative patients had a radical trachelectomy; of those, 40 percent required adjuvant radiation therapy for high-risk features identified on final pathology. Thus, overall, only 30 percent of patients preserved their fertility potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In another series of 45 cases from Hungary, fertility was preserved in 69 percent of cases; there were four recurrences and two deaths. In that series, chemotherapy was given to node-positive patients and those with high-risk features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Lastly, in a large series from China totalizing 62 cases, fertility was preserved in 89 percent of cases. However, 36 percent of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p>So, in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">intermediate-/high-risk</span> features on final pathology post-ART, the concept of adjuvant chemotherapy, as opposed to radiation therapy, is very interesting as it allows fertility preservation. However, this concept is<strong> not</strong> a standard of care and requires further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer#H546745501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of early-stage cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant therapy indications'</a>.) </p><p>In conclusion, the option of ART in patients with larger-size lesions offers good oncologic outcome. However, chances of fertility preservation may be less with that approach, unless adjuvant chemotherapy is given instead of radiation therapy in patients with high-risk features. Another option for women with large-volume disease is the concept of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by fertility-preserving surgery. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE ALTERNATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of fertility-preserving surgery has gained wide acceptance in the oncology community as a valid alternative for young women who wish to preserve their fertility potential. However, a significant proportion of women are denied access to the procedure because of the size of their lesion. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is emerging as a potential option in those women. Conversely, in women with very small lesions, the extensive nature of the radical trachelectomy may be excessive, and more limited local surgery may be sufficient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Neoadjuvant chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical lesions &gt;2 cm are clearly associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence following a vaginal radical trachelectomy (VRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The concept of NACT is to chemo-reduce the size of the lesion, making it possible in good chemo-responders to undergo fertility-sparing surgery after chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-89</a>]. We have used a NACT regimen consisting of a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (TIP) in three patients with excellent tumor response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Two had a complete pathological response and one had only residual dysplasia. There have been no recurrences so far. One patient had two uncomplicated cesarean deliveries at term within one year. Another patient is currently pregnant; the third patient (36 years of age) developed ovarian failure and has been unable to conceive.</p><p>One study summarized six series of NACT followed by fertility-preserving surgery (either cone, simple, or radical trachelectomies), totalizing 35 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Overall, 85 percent of patients preserved fertility. There were three recurrences, all in patients who had &gt;3 mm residual disease in the cervix post-NACT. Overall, 56 percent of patients who tried to conceive were successful. </p><p>Another group proposed the concept of nodal staging prior to proceeding with the NACT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Laparoscopic node evaluation is performed first, and patients with lymph node metastasis are excluded and undergo definitive therapy, whereas node-negative patients undergo the planned fertility-preserving surgery. Therefore, lymph node staging is used to triage and exclude patients with metastatic disease prior to NACT. The disadvantage of this approach is the potential to exclude some patients with minimal lymph node involvement, which might have cleared completely with NACT. Nevertheless, this approach is very interesting and needs to be further evaluated.</p><p>Lastly, it is unclear if a radical trachelectomy needs to be done following NACT or whether a simple trachelectomy or even a large conization would be sufficient. It would appear that in patients with complete clinical response to NACT, with a normal clinical examination and normal pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the probability of finding occult parametrial infiltration is probably very low, and a radical procedure may not be necessary. There is no clear consensus on this issue at this point, and further studies are needed.</p><p>The concept of NACT is appealing and warrants further investigation. In the future, non-gonadotoxic and perhaps less aggressive chemotherapy regimens should be evaluated to reduce the impact on ovarian function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. NACT followed by fertility-preserving surgery seems to offer a greater chance of fertility preservation and a better obstetrical outcome compared with upfront abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART). However, this issue will need to be addressed in larger series.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultraconservative fertility sparing surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the concept of fertility-preserving surgery evolves, it is clear that patients with very early invasive cervical cancer (IA2 and early IB1) probably do not benefit from a radical trachelectomy procedure, since the chance of tumor spread to the parametrial tissue is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/8,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,93</a>]. Moreover, studies have shown that 62 to 67 percent of patients do not have any residual cancer in the trachelectomy specimen if they had a diagnostic cone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. Therefore, a simple trachelectomy or a large cold knife cone involving the removal of most of the cervical tissue is probably sufficient for these patients. However, because of the potential risk of lymph node metastasis, a laparoscopic lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node mapping has been suggested.</p><p>This approach was evaluated in a study of a two-step outpatient treatment program involving 26 patients with stage 1A2 to 1B1 lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Patients first underwent outpatient laparoscopic sentinel node mapping and frozen section followed by a complete pelvic lymph node dissection. One week later, a separate outpatient simple trachelectomy procedure was performed in node- negative patients. Four patients had positive lymph nodes identified on frozen section (15 percent) and underwent a definitive radical hysterectomy. One patient developed a central recurrence, which was successfully treated with chemoradiation. Fifteen pregnancies have occurred, with eight living children delivered at 24 weeks (1), 34 weeks (1), 36 weeks (1), and at term (5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. </p><p>In a series of 16 simple trachelectomy procedures, 81 percent of patients either had no residual disease in the trachelectomy specimen or only in situ disease; no recurrences were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. All eight pregnancies ended with a term delivery (&gt;36 weeks). We also reviewed the literature totalizing 189 cases. Recurrences occurred in two patients (1 percent), and nine (4.8 percent) had lymph node metastasis. Obstetrical outcome on 76 pregnancies was comparable with the VRT series. In some series, patients did not have a cerclage and were allowed to deliver vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>The concept of an ultraconservative treatment approach warrants further investigation to evaluate its oncological safety in a larger group of patients. Strict selection criteria following rigorous preoperative counseling, meticulous review of the preoperative pelvic MRI with an experienced MRI specialist, and a detailed pathological evaluation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">cone/trachelectomy</span> specimen by an experienced gynecologic pathologist will be of paramount importance to avoid recurrences and deaths in these highly curable patients. The obstetrical impact will also need to be studied, given that a meta-analysis demonstrated that conization alone is associated with a significant increase in preterm delivery rate and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].</p><p>There are ongoing studies to prospectively evaluate the safety of less radical surgery in small-volume cervical cancer (ie, a simple cone or simple trachelectomy) for young women who wish to preserve fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. For women not wishing to preserve fertility, a large international prospective randomized <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01658930?term=NCT01658930&rank=1&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwgljvGy8B5W5sYbMw5bZWXTZkelbyxEioPsQqtlZvsPQcILn2WUtBsEwdGSifAvaE4hn3CxipZDew1T2weO8C0PjA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3200\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">trial</a> is currently underway to compare simple hysterectomy and nodes versus radical hysterectomy and nodes in low-risk patients (lesions &lt;2 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. The objective of the trial is to demonstrate that there is no difference in outcome between the two approaches but that less radical surgery is associated with better quality of life and sexual health. So, in conclusion, less radical surgery is an appealing alternative to further reduce the morbidity of more radical surgery, considering the very low risk of parametrial infiltration (&lt;1 percent) in this low-risk group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
