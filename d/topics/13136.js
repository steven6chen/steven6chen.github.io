The higher the plasma ADH, the more concentrated the urine. In most patients with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), ingestion of water does not adequately suppress ADH, and the urine remains concentrated. This leads to water retention, which increases TBW. This increase in TBW lowers the plasma sodium concentration by dilution (see above equation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, the increase in TBW transiently expands the extracellular fluid volume and thereby triggers increased urinary sodium excretion, which both returns the extracellular fluid volume toward normal and further lowers the plasma sodium concentration.</p><p>Hyponatremia can occur in SIADH even if the only fluid given is isotonic saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mechanism by which this occurs and why isotonic saline administration can lower the plasma sodium concentration in patients with SIADH and a highly concentrated urine is discussed separately.

The prevalence of these patterns differs among series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A is characterized by grossly elevated levels of ADH unresponsive to osmotic deviations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Plasma ADH levels are often above that required for maximum antidiuresis, so the urine osmolality is typically very high. High hormone levels above the physiologic range suggest ectopic secretion of ADH, most commonly by bronchogenic carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B is characterized by an abnormally low osmotic threshold for ADH release (ie, a threshold that is below the level of plasma osmolality at which plasma ADH becomes detectable in normal individuals) and a linear increase in plasma ADH in response to a rising plasma osmolality. Such patients have been described as having a &quot;reset osmostat.&quot; Establishing the presence of this condition is important because, unlike other forms of SIADH, there is no need to be concerned that the plasma sodium will continue to fall without therapy, because ADH secretion is suppressed when the plasma osmolality falls below the reset threshold level. This disorder is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hyponatremia: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and reset osmostat&quot;, section on 'Reset osmostat'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type C is characterized by ADH levels that are persistently in the physiologic range and are neither suppressed by a low plasma osmolality nor stimulated by a rising plasma osmolality. This pattern differs quantitatively from type A, in which superphysiologic levels of ADH are observed. However, like type A, it could occur in patients with ectopic ADH secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type D is characterized by normal osmoregulation (ie, ADH secretion varies appropriately with the plasma osmolality), but the urine is concentrated even if ADH release is suppressed. At least one mechanism by which this occurs is a germ cell mutation in which the vasopressin-2 (V2) receptor is constituently activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, one study found that none of the six patients with a type D pattern had an activating mutation of the V2 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other potential mechanisms include production of an antidiuretic compound other than immunoreactive arginine vasopressin and a postreceptor defect in trafficking of aquaporin-2 water channels, which mediate ADH-induced antidiuresis. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary SIADH'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type E is characterized by a decline in plasma ADH as the serum sodium concentration increases during infusion of hypertonic saline. This pattern is hypothesized to be caused by altered baroreceptor signaling despite normovolemia so that a minor decrease in blood pressure or blood volume results in a large increase in ADH secretion. Similarly, a minor increase in blood pressure or blood volume caused by saline infusion results in a large decrease in ADH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of urine output</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the persistent secretion of ADH, there are two other potentially important determinants of the urine output in patients with SIADH: the rate of solute excretion and partial escape from the effect of ADH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Solute excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal subjects, the urine output is primarily determined by water intake. Changes in water intake lead to alterations in the plasma osmolality that are sensed by the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus that regulate both ADH release and thirst. As an example, an increase in water intake sequentially lowers the plasma osmolality, decreases ADH secretion, and reduces collecting tubule permeability to water; the net effect is the rapid excretion of the excess water in a dilute urine.</p><p>In SIADH, however, an increase in water intake does not produce an increase in water excretion because ADH release is relatively fixed. Suppose that a patient has moderately severe SIADH with a urine osmolality that cannot be reduced below 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (the normal minimum urine osmolality is 40 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span>. In this patient, the urine output is determined by the rate of excretion of solutes (primarily sodium and potassium salts and urea). Now suppose this patient consumes a typical Western diet containing approximately 750 mosmol of solute, all of which are excreted in the urine each day. With a fixed urine osmolarity of 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> the daily urine output will be only one liter (750 &divide; 750 = 1), and it will not increase in response to increased water intake.</p><p>One way to increase water excretion in this hypothetical patient with SIADH is to prescribe a high-salt and -protein diet while restricting water ingestion. If, for example, the solute intake and therefore solute excretion rose to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day,</span> the urine output would increase to 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> (1200 &divide; 750 = 1.6). The increase in water excretion would then tend to raise the plasma sodium concentration toward normal.</p><p>Similar considerations concerning the role of solute intake apply when ADH effect is relatively fixed at a low level in central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine output in diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Escape from the effect of ADH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in experimental animals given ADH and water have shown an initial phase of water retention and hyponatremia followed by partial escape from the antidiuresis so that, despite persistently high levels of ADH, urine osmolality decreases. When the urine osmolality falls, water excretion increases, matching water intake, and the plasma sodium concentration tends to stabilize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

However, with these severe neurologic conditions, there is uncertainty as to whether the sodium losses are a result of SIADH-induced expansion of the extracellular volume or whether they are caused by salt wasting (ie, cerebral salt wasting), with release of ADH that is secondary to a reduction in extracellular fluid volume. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral salt wasting'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of this uncertainty, therapy of hyponatremia in patients with CNS disorders usually requires the administration of hypertonic saline, rather than fluid restriction or isotonic saline.

The mean serum sodium concentrations among men with one copy of the variant allele are lower by approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. In vitro, TRPV4 channels with the variant allele are hyporesponsive to mild hypotonic stress but respond normally to severe osmotic stress. Thus, affected individuals would be expected to behave as if they have a reset osmostat, with a lower-than-normal serum sodium concentration that regulates normally around that value. Based upon what has been observed in genetically engineered mice that lack a functioning TRVPV4 channel, it has been postulated that humans with the variant hypofunctioning allele would exhibit unrestricted drinking, and therefore, more severe hyponatremia, if they were to develop SIADH for another reason.

In most patients with SIADH, ingestion of water does not adequately suppress ADH, and the urine remains concentrated. This leads to water retention, which increases total body water (TBW). This increase in TBW lowers the plasma sodium concentration by dilution. In addition, the increase in TBW transiently expands the extracellular fluid volume and thereby triggers increased urinary sodium excretion, which both returns the extracellular fluid volume toward normal and further lowers the plasma sodium concentration.
