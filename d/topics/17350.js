A toe fracture is when a person breaks a bone in the toe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83480\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83480 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different types of toe fractures. The type of toe fracture depends on which toe bone breaks and how it breaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869505972\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a toe fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a toe fracture can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A crooked-looking toe</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869505987\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a toe fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and order an X-ray of your toe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869506002\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a toe fracture treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of toe fracture you have and how severe it is.</p><p>Treatment for a toe fracture usually involves:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting your foot</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising your foot above the level of your heart, for example, by propping it up on pillows &ndash; This is helpful only for the first few days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on your toe &ndash; Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the toe every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and the skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after the injury. Some people find it helpful to ice up to 2 days after the injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buddy taping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83507\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83507 \">figure 2</a>) &ndash; This involves taping the injured toe to the toe next to it. The doctor or nurse will put some cotton or other soft material between your toes so they don't rub together.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing a cast or special hard-soled shoe &ndash; Most people can put weight on their foot and walk around while wearing a cast. Before your doctor puts a cast on your foot, he or she will make sure your toe bones are in the correct position. If your bones are not in the correct position, he or she might need to do a procedure to put your bones back in the correct position.</p><p/><p>Your doctor will also treat your pain. If you have a lot of pain or a severe fracture, your doctor will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If your fracture is mild, your doctor might recommend that you take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Over-the-counter pain medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869506040\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does a toe fracture take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A toe fracture usually takes weeks to heal, depending on the type of fracture.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869506055\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your fracture is healing. This includes instructions about when you can put weight on your foot.</p><p>Doctors also usually recommend that people with a fracture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid getting the cast wet, if it's a cast that shouldn't get wet.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking. Fractures can take longer to heal if people smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869506093\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain, swelling, or bruising gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or tingling in your toes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You damage your cast or get it wet, and it's not supposed to get wet.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your cast is too tight or too loose.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869506108\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
