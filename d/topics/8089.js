Information from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) database shows that the population-based incident rate of dialysis initiation among older adults has been declining for several years to a level just under 1600 per million per year in 2015; this is compared with a peak of approximately 1800 per million per year in 2010 and is the lowest rate since 1999. Twenty eight thousand six hundred forty-four (28,644) patients 75 years of age and older initiated dialysis in 2015 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F116707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116707 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The reason for the decline is not known. Possible reasons include a real decrease in advanced kidney disease, changes in practice such as starting dialysis at lower levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and increasing use of conservative care (ie, without dialysis or transplant) among older adults.</p><p>Older adults may be less likely to be started on dialysis compared with younger patients with a similar degree of kidney dysfunction. This was suggested by a community-based cohort study of over 1.8 million adults in Alberta, Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At a follow-up of 4.4 years, among patients who had an estimated GFR (eGFR) of 15 to 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> at the beginning of the study, the rate of untreated kidney failure (defined as eGFR &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was over fivefold greater for patients &gt;85 years of age compared with those 18 to 44 years. The individual reasons for withholding dialysis cannot be determined from this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. On the other hand, in the US, the mean eGFR at initiation of dialysis is very similar for those &gt;75 years of age (10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) compared with those in the 65 to 74 and 45 to 64 age groups (10.4 and 10.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F116707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116707 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3945002772\"><span class=\"h2\">Selected modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, most older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (&gt;75 years of age) use in-center hemodialysis (94 percent), with 6 percent using peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the 2017 USRDS Annual Report, the percentage of incident dialysis patients &gt;75 years on peritoneal dialysis was 6 percent compared with 8 percent among those 65 to 74 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among prevalent patients, 6 percent of those 75 years or older were on peritoneal dialysis compared with 7 percent of those 65 to 74 years of age. In a report from one of the largest US dialysis companies, fewer than 0.4 percent of incident patients &gt;65 years who received dialysis for&nbsp;at least 60 days were started on home hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2487122134\"><span class=\"h2\">Decision to initiate maintenance dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to initiate maintenance dialysis should be discussed with all older patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). The decision to initiate dialysis should be shared between the clinician and the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> family, if appropriate). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease#H3740033424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in the care of the patient with end-stage renal disease&quot;, section on 'Education and communication with the patient'</a>.)</p><p>The timing of the discussions regarding dialysis depends on the rate of decline in kidney function. Dialysis should be discussed early in the course of CKD in patients with rapidly deteriorating kidney function so that an appropriate access for dialysis may be placed in time to be ready for use. For patients who choose hemodialysis, a vascular access should be placed approximately three to six months before use (see <a href=\"#H1625196600\" class=\"local\">'Timing of access placement'</a> below). For patients who choose peritoneal dialysis, a peritoneal dialysis catheter should be placed 10 to 14 days before use, unless the dialysis center is equipped to perform urgent-start peritoneal dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and maintenance of the peritoneal dialysis catheter&quot;, section on 'Post-placement catheter care'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with a slower decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), we generally initiate the discussion when the eGFR declines below 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Initial early discussions should simply introduce the possible need for dialysis (or transplantation) at some point in the future. As the eGFR declines, more focused discussions should occur over multiple office visits. These discussions should include dialysis modalities, timing, and the option of conservative care without dialysis. Options for kidney transplantation may also be discussed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-transplantation-and-the-older-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal transplantation and the older adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In order for the patient to make a decision regarding dialysis, he or she needs to know what dialysis may provide in terms of quantity and quality of life. The clinician should realistically characterize (to the extent possible) the prognosis, including risk of hospitalization, life expectancy, and quality-of-life expectations with and without dialysis. Prognostic models have been developed to estimate both short-term (three- to six-month) and longer-term (more than one year) mortality in various populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. These may be useful for guiding discussions with some patients who desire rough estimates of mortality risk over specific timeframes, although the imprecise predictions of these models must be acknowledged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3460973799\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Not all older patients are good candidates for dialysis. Dialysis is generally less likely to provide the same benefit for older patients as it does for younger individuals. The life expectancy of older patients is lower than younger patients, and dialysis may not extend this significantly. Any anticipated extension of life expectancy needs to be balanced with the need for access-related procedures and a likely increase in hospitalization risk. (See <a href=\"#H3460973799\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Quality of life may deteriorate after initiation of dialysis. Hospitalizations tend to increase among older patients who start dialysis, and, even in the absence of hospitalizations, the hemodialysis procedure itself may cause fatigue and malaise that is accentuated and lasts longer among older patients compared with younger individuals.</p><p>However, many older patients benefit from dialysis. Such patients tend to have fewer comorbidities and good quality of life at baseline.</p><p>Patients generally respond to questions regarding dialysis in one of three ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some will choose to go ahead with dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some will choose not to be dialyzed and elect conservative care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conservative care of end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many older patients are ambivalent toward dialysis and will ask that they be dialyzed only if and when they have no alternative but death.</p><p/><p>All subsequent management decisions can be stratified accordingly. However, it is important to remember that the patient may change his or her mind at subsequent visits, and we almost always discuss dialysis during multiple visits over time regardless of the patient's initial decision.</p><p>Regardless of the decision regarding dialysis, all patients should be followed equally closely by the nephrologist, with careful attention to the treatment of anemia, chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder and diet. In addition, particularly among patients who do not wish to be dialyzed or who are ambivalent about starting dialysis, we make every effort to preserve kidney function with careful control of blood pressure and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and with avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and contrast agents, if possible. Blood pressure control goals should be individualized (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>). Some clinicians stop or reduce the dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs at the very late stages of CKD to allow improvement of GFR, particularly in patients with relatively minimal proteinuria. Specific recommendations for conservative care are provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conservative-care-of-end-stage-renal-disease#H442573925\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conservative care of end-stage renal disease&quot;, section on 'Medical management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4294147764\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis modality (ie, hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis) should be selected based on comorbidities, patient preference and capability (as well as social support), and occasionally goals of care but not on outcomes, which have not been shown to be different between modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most older patients initiate dialysis with in-center hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"#H3945002772\" class=\"local\">'Selected modality'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Based on comorbidities &ndash;</strong> Peritoneal dialysis may be preferred in older patients with significant heart failure or pulmonary hypertension because it allows daily ultrafiltration and avoids risks associated with vascular access required for hemodialysis. However, peritoneal dialysis may not be possible for some older patients, such as those who have had extensive abdominal surgery. Patients should be individually evaluated for medical indications or contraindications based on comorbidities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, the medical indications or contraindications to hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are not different for older adults as for younger CKD patients, although comorbidities tend to be more common among older adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access#H1501537144\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of heart failure caused by hemodialysis arteriovenous access&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-hypertension-in-hemodialysis-patients#H518583624\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary hypertension in hemodialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Dialysis modality in preexisting PH'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient preference, capability and goals of care &#9472;</strong> If comorbidities allow for either modality and both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are available, then the&nbsp;modality should be selected based on patient preference (and, when appropriate, family preference if the patient is likely to need help performing peritoneal dialysis at home).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some older patients benefit from the social nature of being at a hemodialysis facility, while others prefer to avoid the need to travel to and from a facility and prefer to dialyze at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Furthermore, if goals of care include minimizing the impact of dialysis on lifestyle, then peritoneal dialysis may be preferred. Patients who initiate dialysis with significant residual renal function often require less dialysis. Among individual patients, it is easier to factor in residual renal function to the prescription of peritoneal dialysis (also called incremental dialysis) than it is for in-center hemodialysis, which can be constrained by scheduling of shifts. For many patients, less dialysis is less burdensome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, as noted above, peritoneal dialysis requires reasonable cognitive function and patient mobility and may require significant support at home. Assisted peritoneal dialysis, if available, may be an option for older patients who prefer peritoneal dialysis but are unable to perform the procedure without assistance and who lack sufficient support at home. With assisted peritoneal dialysis, a hired caregiver provides support. A number of studies have suggested that assisted peritoneal dialysis is cost effective and may provide better quality of life than in-center hemodialysis for older frail patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outcomes &#9472;</strong> Modality is not selected on the basis of improved survival. There are no conclusive data that suggest benefit in terms of mortality or technique survival with either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis among older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Retrospective studies including adult CKD patients of all ages have shown mortality to be better, worse, or similar with peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/20-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-30</a>]. The interpretation of these studies is limited by selection bias; more functional patients tend to be selected for peritoneal dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, few studies have focused on quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or controlled for frailty, which is an important predictor of outcome with any dialysis modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among older patients, it is important to try to distinguish the symptoms of uremia from those of aging (particularly fatigue and decreased appetite) and medication side effects. This is particularly important for patients who are ambivalent about starting dialysis since such symptoms related to aging will not improve with dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3846878833\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular access</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2223159697\"><span class=\"h3\">Selection of access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endogenous arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), arteriovenous grafts (AVGs), and tunneled catheters are all used in older patients for permanent vascular access. The selection of access should be individualized based on life expectancy and comorbidities and in consultation with a vascular surgeon with experience in the creation of hemodialysis vascular access.</p><p>For older dialysis patients who are thought to have a good chance of AVF maturation prior to initiation of hemodialysis and a reasonable life expectancy, AVFs should be the first choice for chronic hemodialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Among all CKD patients and compared with AVGs and with catheters, AVFs are associated with fewer complications and lower mortality.

AVGs are less likely to be successful in such patients and may be associated with higher risk.

In an analysis of 115,425 patients &ge;67 years of age who were identified from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), there was no difference in overall mortality between patients who received an AVF for the first predialysis dialysis access (n = 21,436) and those who received an AVG (n = 3472) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. When data were stratified by age, AVGs were associated with decreased survival compared with AVFs among patients ages 67 to &le;79 years but not among those &ge;80 years.</p><p>The success rates of AVFs among older patients vary between centers but are generally lower than adults overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. In one report from two teaching hospitals in Canada including 152 accesses in patients older than 80 years, the primary patency rate (ie, with no intervention) was 40 percent at 12 months and 12 percent 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The reported primary patency rate among adults overall is approximately 40 to 80 percent.

Because AVFs are less likely to be successful, older patients who have an AVF placed as a first access are more likely to initiate dialysis with a catheter than had an AVG been placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/37,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,45</a>]. In one study of 3418 older patients, those who underwent predialysis AVF creation were more likely to have undergone placement of a catheter for hemodialysis initiation compared with those who underwent AVG creation (46 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

A more recent meta-analysis also supported use of brachiocephalic fistulas in older patients reporting higher 12-month primary and secondary patency rates for brachiocephalic compared with radiocephalic AVF.

For instance, we may provide incremental dialysis (ie, shorter or less frequent treatments that do not meet standard <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> targets) to patients whose quality of life is impaired by standard hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis schedules, particularly those who still have residual renal function. The risks and benefits of such an approach should be discussed with the patient if such an approach is taken.

In a meta-analysis that included 89 studies and 294,921 older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (mean age 76.5 years), the one-year survival was only 73 percent; this was just slightly better than the survival for patients who underwent conservative care (71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, there was marked heterogeneity between studies that could not be explained by study design, size, the definition of older adult, or the cohort era. In addition, survival data for patients undergoing conservative care were only available for 724 individuals, and there were very few studies with head-to-head comparisons of dialysis versus conservative care. As a result, confidence in results is limited.</p><p>A subsequent retrospective study of a single-center cohort from the Netherlands compared survival outcomes among patients &gt;70 years who chose conservative care (n = 107) versus dialysis (n = 204) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Among all patients, in-depth discussions regarding renal replacement therapies (RRTs) (including dialysis and transplantation) and conservative care were initiated when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) fell to &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Patients who chose conservative care continued to receive full medical treatment and multidisciplinary care, including specialist nurses, dieticians, and social workers.</p><p>Survival was calculated from different starting points including the time at which the treatment decision was first made and from times at which the eGFR was first &lt;20, &lt;15, and &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Among all individuals, the overall median survival was higher for those patients who chose dialysis when measured from all time points. For dialysis versus conservative care, the median survival from the time of modality choice was 3.1 versus 1.5 years. Similarly, from the time of the first eGFR &lt;20, &lt;15, and &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the median survival was 4.5 versus 2.4 years, 3.1 versus 1.5 years, and 2.8 versus 0.5 years, respectively. The survival advantage conferred by dialysis was substantially reduced, though still statistically significant, among patients &gt;70 years who had cardiovascular or other severe comorbidity.</p><p>However, among patients 80 years or older, there was no difference between groups in survival measured from any starting point (2.1 versus 1.4 years overall).</p><p>Independent predictors of poor survival include age, poor nutritional status, nonambulatory status, late referral for dialysis initiation, and the presence of significant comorbid conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].</p><p>Prognostic models have been developed to estimate both short-term (three- to six-month) and longer-term (more than one year) mortality in various populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>], although most performed more poorly when tested in an external validation cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Perhaps the most accurate model was developed using data from the AROii European database including 11,508 incident dialysis patients and validated using the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Survey (DOPPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Using this risk score, patients older than 80 years start with a 10 and 20 percent one- and two-year mortality. The addition of smoking history, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, body mass index &lt;18.5, and initiation with a catheter increased the one- and two-year mortality risk to 25 and 65 percent, respectively. The addition of a low hemoglobin, high C-reactive protein, and low serum albumin increased the mortality risk further. This and other risk scores may overestimate mortality as they did not include patients who transition to transplantation or peritoneal dialysis, both which select for healthier individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Prediction models for loss of physical function have also been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-dialysis-in-the-older-adult/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>], although not in a US dialysis population.</p><p>The utility of these risk scores for the care of individual patients remains uncertain.
