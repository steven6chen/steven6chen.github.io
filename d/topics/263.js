Most of these conditions are thought to be caused by immune system dysregulation triggered by an infectious or other environmental agent in a genetically susceptible host.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of ADEM in children. Treatment and prognosis of ADEM in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADEM is an uncommon illness; the estimated incidence in California and Japan is 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">4/100,000</span> children per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], and in Canada is 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/100,000</span> per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approximately three to six cases are seen each year at regional medical centers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. There is no specific ethnic distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Several studies indicate a slight male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Postinfectious</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADEM is often preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, usually in the form of a nonspecific upper respiratory infection. In three series, an antecedent infection could be identified in 72 to 77 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8</a>]. A seasonal distribution also has been observed, with most cases presenting in the winter and spring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. In general, patients will present within one month of their illness.</p><p>Numerous pathogens have been associated with the disorder. Viruses that have been implicated include coronavirus, coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex, hepatitis A, HIV, influenza, measles, rubella, varicella zoster, and West Nile virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,9-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-17</a>]. Other organisms associated include Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia, Leptospira, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rickettsia, and beta hemolytic Streptococcus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Postvaccinial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less than 5 percent of all ADEM cases follow immunization. Postvaccinial ADEM has been associated with immunization for rabies, hepatitis B, influenza, Japanese B encephalitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus,</span> measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, polio, smallpox, and varicella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. No infectious agent is isolated in most cases.</p><p>Currently, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination are most often associated with postvaccination ADEM. It is important to recognize the significant difference between the incidence of ADEM associated with the live measles vaccination (1 to 2 per 1 million) and the incidence of ADEM previously associated with the measles virus infection (1 in 1000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Introduction of vaccination has markedly reduced the occurrence of measles in developed countries, although vaccine-associated ADEM is described in 2 cases per 1 million.</p><p>The Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Viral Hepatitis of the World Health Organization has suggested a maximal period of three months to diagnose a vaccination-associated ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of ADEM is incompletely understood. However, ADEM appears to be an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that is triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. The proposed mechanism is that myelin autoantigens, such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte protein, share antigenic determinants with those of an infecting pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Epstein-Barr virus provides an example of this. The virus contains a pentapeptide sequence in its nuclear antigen (EBNA) that shares sequence homology with an epitope of myelin basic protein, a major protein of the myelin sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Antiviral antibodies or a cell-mediated response to the pathogen cross react with the myelin autoantigens, resulting in ADEM. Epstein-Barr virus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, in part based upon this concept of molecular mimicry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Environmental triggers'</a>.)</p><p>This mechanism is also supported by studies of lymphocytes in children with ADEM. In one report, the frequency of T cell lines that reacted to myelin basic protein was 10 times higher in patients with ADEM compared with those with encephalitis or normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The immunopathological events leading to ADEM can be divided into two major phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial T cell priming and activation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent recruitment and effector phase</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Priming and activation phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The priming phase occurs in systemic secondary lymphoid organs, where the antigen-presenting cell presents myelin protein antigen and peptides to neuroantigen-reactive T cells. The activated T cells expand and then migrate to the central nervous system via the postcapillary venules into the perivascular space. In the Virchow-Robin space, the T cells re-encounter their cognate antigen, in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules expressed by dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This reactivation allows the T cells to migrate through the glial limitans and enter the brain parenchyma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Recruitment and effector phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further recruitment occurs through the production of cytokines and chemokines by antigen-presenting cells and activated T cells, promoting migration into the central nervous system of additional T cells as well as other leukocytes such as poly- and monomorphonuclear phagocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier occurs by release of proteases from recruited mast cells, T cells, and monocytes. In addition, there is production of reactive oxygen radicals, causing further endothelial injury. This leads to the effector phase, in which T cells have more of a secondary role to other inflammatory processes that cause demyelination and axonal injury. These include oxygen and nitrogen radicals, tumor necrosis factor-a, direct and indirect complement activation, antibody-dependent cellular toxicity, myelin phagocytosis, direct axonal injury by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, protease secretion, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxic injury of the oligodendrocytes also occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The inflammatory process continues for a few days to two weeks, resulting in stretches of demyelinated axons, some of which may be transected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The repair process begins with activation and proliferation of astrocytes. There is clearing of debris by macrophages and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and various growth factors by resident cells and T cells. Oligodendrocyte precursors become activated and, along with surviving oligodendrocytes, begin the process of remyelination.</p><p>The clinical and imaging outcome of ADEM most often shows complete recovery. However, there may be subtle differences in repaired myelin compared with uninjured myelin, including altered thickness and redistribution of sodium channels. In addition, the relative composition of myelin peptides is altered to forms that may have increased vulnerability to further damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This may explain recurrent forms of ADEM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathology of ADEM in humans is similar to an animal model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27,28</a>]. In this model, injections of brain extracts in rabbits cause some animals to manifest an encephalitic-like disease process associated with demyelination. The demyelination appears to result from a cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>The histologic appearance of EAE includes perivenous demyelination and inflammation, with an abundance of lymphocytes and macrophages. Lesions often have a flame-like appearance that is similar to pathologic findings in humans with ADEM. They are usually distinct from the lesions of multiple sclerosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A febrile illness occurs in 50 to 75 percent of children in the four weeks prior to the onset of typical neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Neurologic symptoms typically appear 4 to 13 days after the infection or vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,8</a>].</p><p>Fever, headache, vomiting, and meningismus are often present at the time of initial presentation and may persist during the hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>]. Encephalopathy is a characteristic feature and usually develops rapidly in association with multifocal neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. New clinical symptoms may develop during hospitalization. Progression of neurologic signs to maximum deficits usually occurs over four to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. With encephalopathy, irritability and confusion are common; the level of consciousness ranges from sleepiness and lethargy to frank coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. While the alteration in mental state often raises concern for the possibility of seizures, these occur in only one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31</a>].</p><p>In addition to encephalopathy, the most common neurologic features of ADEM include long tract (pyramidal) signs, acute hemiparesis, cerebellar ataxia, cranial neuropathies including optic neuritis, and spinal cord dysfunction (transverse myelitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-8,29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8,29,31</a>]. Aphasia, movement disorders, and sensory deficits are less common.</p><p>Symptoms of optic neuritis include vision loss, pain with eye movement, and an afferent pupillary defect. Inflammation of the optic disc may be seen on direct funduscopic examination if there is extensive involvement of the optic nerve. Patients with retrobulbar optic neuritis typically have a normal funduscopic examination. Direct imaging of the optic nerve with a gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits is a more sensitive means to diagnose optic neuritis in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-neuritis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic neuritis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of transverse myelitis include flaccid paralysis of the legs with a sensory level on examination. The arms can be involved if the demyelinating lesion is in the cervical cord. Respiratory failure may occur with high cervical lesions that extend into the brainstem. Bowel and bladder involvement secondary to spinal cord disease results in constipation and urinary retention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severe phase of ADEM typically lasts from two to four weeks. Children may deteriorate after hospital admission, and many develop new neurologic signs. Patients usually recover completely from the acute illness, although some have neurologic sequelae. In the three contemporary series noted above, all affected patients survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory hemorrhagic demyelination of central nervous system white matter is seen in rare conditions that are considered to be hyperacute variants of ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,32-34</a>].

Otherwise, their symptomatology is similar to ADEM, with meningismus, headache, seizures, multifocal neurologic signs, asymmetrical neurologic deficits, and coma. They typically follow an upper respiratory infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Brain imaging with MRI may reveal diffuse white matter lesions, often large and associated with cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. White matter lesions can be detected on MRI within 72 hours of the first symptoms, but hemorrhage itself is not necessarily seen with conventional T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Specialized spin-echo MRI sequences are more readily able to identify the acute hemorrhage associated with this form of ADEM.</p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid typically shows both white and red blood cells, with increased protein concentration.</p><p>Some patients recover with treatment. However, the prognosis for survival and recovery of neurologic function is worse for AHL than ADEM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MRI abnormalities are best defined by T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68014\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68014 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Contrast enhancement is seen at times in acute lesions. Findings may progress over a relatively short period of time, consistent with evolution of the disease process.</p><p>Computer tomography (CT) scans are often normal, and thus, are not helpful.</p><p>Abnormalities on MRI vary in location. Lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to be poorly marginated. Almost all patients have multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter, characteristic of demyelination. The periventricular white matter is often spared. Hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images (ie, black holes) are unusual in ADEM, and their persistence is predictive of multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>Multiple brain lesions are typically present, but the number varies among patients. As an example, patients in one study had from 4 to 56 brain lesions on the initial MRI scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While the lesions in ADEM are often large, smaller lesions are also seen, with diameters ranging from &lt;5 mm to 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,8</a>]. The large lesions may have associated mass effect.</p><p>Gray matter lesions sometimes accompany the white matter abnormalities in ADEM, especially in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,41,42</a>]. The thalami and basal ganglia are frequently affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68014\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68014 \">image 1</a>), and lesions in these locations are often symmetrical. In contrast, supratentorial lesions are usually asymmetrical.</p><p>Brainstem and spinal cord abnormalities on MRI are common in ADEM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68014\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68014 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76694\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76694 \">image 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>].

Enhancement is variable.</p><p>Hemorrhagic demyelinating lesions are seen in the hyperacute ADEM variants that include acute hemorrhage leukoencephalitis, acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis, and acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis of Weston Hurst. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p>Imaging often improves with convalescence, although lesions sometimes persist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76694\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76694 \">image 2</a>). Among 19 patients studied two months to nine years after demyelination, lesions resolved completely in seven, partially in 10, and remained unchanged in two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Viral cultures should be obtained from nasopharynx and stool.</p><p>Serum testing for antibodies directed against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is indicated for children who have clinical features consistent with ADEM and MRI findings not typical of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). The persistence of high titer anti-MOG antibodies may be associated with an increased risk for relapse. For patients with detectable anti-MOG antibody titers, repeat testing should be performed every six months for at least one year. Patients with persistently high titers should be closely observed clinically and have repeat imaging every 6 to 12 months. Anti-MOG antibodies, while not specific for ADEM, may have prognostic value, suggesting an increased risk for recurrent demyelinating disease other than multiple sclerosis.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Sequential imaging by MRI during follow-up is sometimes required to confirm the diagnosis of ADEM, as the development of relapses with new lesions on MRI is not compatible with a diagnosis of monophasic ADEM, and suggests that the correct diagnosis is either multiphasic ADEM or multiple sclerosis (MS), depending on the clinical and imaging features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The major criteria are a first polyfocal clinical attack of central nervous system demyelinating disease, encephalopathy that cannot be explained by fever, systemic illness, or postictal symptoms, the absence of new clinical and MRI findings three months or more after onset, and an abnormal brain MRI during the acute (three-month) phase. Brain MRI typically shows diffuse, poorly demarcated, large (&gt;1 to 2 cm) lesions predominantly involving the white matter. Deep gray matter lesions (eg, thalamus or basal ganglia) can be present on MRI, but hypointense T1-weighted white matter lesions are rare.</p><p>Encephalopathy as a presenting symptom is required for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Encephalopathy is defined to include either behavioral changes, such as confusion or excessive irritability, or more severe alterations in the level of consciousness, such as stupor, lethargy, or coma, that is unexplained by fever, systemic illness, or postictal symptoms. The onset of the encephalopathy must correspond with the occurrence of the disease state. This feature helps to distinguish ADEM from other clinically isolated syndromes, which have a greater risk for recurrence and subsequent diagnosis of MS.

Progression of neurologic signs to maximum deficits usually occurs over four to seven days. The level of consciousness ranges from lethargy to frank coma. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory hemorrhagic demyelination of central nervous system white matter is seen in rare conditions that are considered to be hyperacute variants of ADEM.

Brainstem and spinal cord abnormalities are common. Gray matter lesions may be observed in the thalami and basal ganglia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ADEM is based upon the clinical and radiologic features. Diagnostic criteria for ADEM in children require a first polyfocal clinical attack of central nervous system demyelinating disease, encephalopathy that cannot be explained by fever, and an abnormal brain MRI during the acute (three-month) phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74896 \">table 1</a>). Brain MRI typically shows diffuse, poorly demarcated, large (&gt;1 to 2 cm) lesions predominantly involving the white matter. In a child who presents with signs of encephalitis, bacterial and viral meningitis or encephalitis must be considered and ruled out. A lumbar puncture and MRI of the brain and spinal cord should be performed whenever the diagnosis of ADEM is suspected. Multiphasic ADEM is characterized by an isolated second ADEM episode more than three months after the initial event, regardless of the timing of glucocorticoid use.
