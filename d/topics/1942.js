Beta-lactam antibiotics include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penicillins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cephalosporins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cephamycins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbapenems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monobactams</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-lactamase inhibitors</p><p/><p>Since this category of antibiotics is so broad, it is important to subdivide these drugs into functional drug groups to facilitate understanding and prescribing practices. It is not necessary for clinicians to know every drug within each of these groups. The grouping of these agents can be based upon spectrum of activity, for choice of agents for an antibiotic formulary, for therapeutic use or for routine susceptibility testing. Within each functional group, differences between antibiotics in pharmacokinetics, safety, duration of the clinical experience with their use, and cost allow reasonable choices to be made in selecting an individual drug as representative of that group.</p><p>The mechanisms of action and resistance and major adverse reactions to these antibiotics will be reviewed here. The penicillins, cephalosporins, and novel beta-lactam drugs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-antistaphylococcal-penicillins-and-broad-spectrum-penicillins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and broad-spectrum penicillins&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalosporins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cephalosporins&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=combination-beta-lactamase-inhibitors-carbapenems-and-monobactams\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Combination beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems, and monobactams&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit the growth of sensitive bacteria by inactivating enzymes located in the bacterial cell membrane, which are involved in the third stage of cell wall synthesis. It is during this stage that linear strands of peptidoglycan are cross-linked into a fishnet-like polymer that surrounds the bacterial cell and confers osmotic stability in the hypertonic milieu of the infected patient. Beta-lactams inhibit not just a single enzyme involved in cell wall synthesis, but a family of related enzymes (four to eight in different bacteria), each involved in different aspects of cell wall synthesis. These enzymes can be detected by their covalent binding of radioactively-labeled penicillin (or other beta-lactams) and hence have been called penicillin binding proteins (PBPs).</p><p>Different PBPs appear to serve different functions for the bacterial cell. As an example, PBP2 in <em>Escherichia coli</em> is important in maintaining the rod-like shape of the bacillus, while PBP3 is involved in septation during cell division [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Different beta-lactam antibiotics may preferentially bind to and inhibit certain PBPs more than others. Thus, different agents may produce characteristic effects on bacterial morphology and have different efficacies in inhibiting bacterial growth or killing the organism.</p><p>Beta-lactam antibiotics are generally bactericidal against organisms that they inhibit. The mechanism of bacterial cell killing is an indirect consequence of the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Enzymes that mediate autolysis of peptidoglycan are normally present in the bacterial cell wall but are strictly regulated to allow breakdown of the peptidoglycan only at growing points. Beta-lactam inhibition of cell wall synthesis leads to activation of the autolytic system through a two component system, <span class=\"nowrap\">VncR/S,</span> which initiates a cell death program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Certain bacteria are deficient in these autolytic enzymes or have mutations in the regulatory genes; these strains show the phenomenon of &quot;tolerance&quot; to beta-lactam antibiotics, that is, their growth is inhibited by the antibiotic but the bacteria are not killed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF BACTERIAL RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three general mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, including the beta-lactams, have been well characterized: decreased penetration to or increased efflux from the target site; alteration of the target site; and inactivation of the antibiotic by a bacterial enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased penetration to the target site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacilli provides an efficient barrier to the penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics to their target PBPs in the bacterial plasma membrane. Beta-lactams usually must pass through the hydrophilic porin protein channels in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacilli to reach the periplasmic space and plasma membrane. The permeability barrier of the outer membrane is a major factor in the resistance of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> to many beta-lactam antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Alteration of the target site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The target sites for the beta-lactams are the PBPs in the cytoplasmic membrane. Alterations in PBPs may influence their binding affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics and therefore the sensitivity of the altered bacterial cell to inhibition by these antibiotics. Such a mechanism is responsible for penicillin resistance in pneumococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], methicillin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a>) resistance in staphylococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and for bacteria with increasing intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams, such as gonococci, enterococci, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inactivation by a bacterial enzyme</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Production of beta-lactamase is a major mechanism of resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates. Such bacterial enzymes may cleave predominantly penicillins (penicillinases), cephalosporins (cephalosporinases), or both (beta-lactamases). Their production may be encoded within the bacterial chromosome (and hence be characteristic of an entire species) or the genes may be acquired on a plasmid or transposon (and hence be characteristic of an individual strain rather than the species). Bacteria may synthesize the beta-lactamase constitutively (as for many plasmid-mediated enzymes) or synthesis may be inducible in the presence of antibiotic (as for many chromosomal enzymes). Inducible beta-lactamases may not be reliably detected by initial susceptibility testing, particularly with the newer rapid methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Chromosomal beta-lactamases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although virtually all Gram-negative bacilli possess a chromosomal beta-lactamase gene, certain species express insignificant amounts of this enzyme and their susceptibility to beta-lactams is largely determined by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and antibiotic permeability. These include <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, and <em>H. influenzae</em>. <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> produces a chromosomal beta-lactamase that is primarily a penicillinase; thus, these strains are frequently more susceptible to the cephalosporins. The last group of species within the Enterobacteriaceae, including <em>Enterobacter</em>, indole-positive <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Morganella</em>, <em>Serratia,</em> and <em>Citrobacter</em>, produce an inducible chromosomal beta-lactamase, AmpC, that may be difficult to detect on initial susceptibility testing but that can mediate resistance to all currently available beta-lactams with the exception of the carbapenems and perhaps <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In addition to inducible production of this chromosomal enzyme, these species may give rise to regulatory mutants that are &quot;derepressed&quot; and produce high levels of this broad-spectrum chromosomal enzyme constitutively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Gram-negative bacteria (such as TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1) mediate resistance to the penicillins and first- and some of the second-generation cephalosporins, but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a>, cephamycins, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, or the novel beta-lactam compounds such as the carbapenems or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>.</p><p>More recently, extended-spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (derived from the common TEM and SHV enzymes) have arisen, which are capable of cleaving later-generation cephalosporins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Originally described in strains of <em>Klebsiella</em> from Europe, these beta-lactamases have now been found in a variety of Gram-negative bacilli in many areas of the United States, and spread between patients in intensive care units has been documented. In addition, a study from Chicago documented that nursing home patients may be an important reservoir for strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one nursing home, for example, 18 of 39 patients were colonized with such resistant strains, and of the 55 patients in an acute care hospital colonized with resistant <em>E. coli</em> or <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, 35 had been admitted from nursing homes and 31 of them were colonized on admission. Although the strains of resistant <em>E. coli</em> and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> differed, most harbored a common plasmid encoding an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, suggesting intraspecies and interspecies transfer of the plasmid between strains, rather than transfer of a single strain between patients. All of these strains were resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, and 96 and 41 percent were also resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, respectively.</p><p>These enzymes, of which there are many varieties, mediate high-level resistance to the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>, but not to the cephamycins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a>) or the carbapenems. However, use of the cephamycins against strains containing these new enzymes is limited by the development of permeability mutants in the porin protein, OmpF. The beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanate, sulbactam, tazobactam, and avibactam, have generally retained the ability to inhibit these newer plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase, MIR-1, has been described in <em>Klebsiella</em>, which is homologous to the AmpC chromosomal beta-lactamase of <em>Enterobacter cloacae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase is capable of cleaving all of the currently available beta-lactams (with the exception of the carbapenems) and its activity is <strong>not</strong> inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam. This plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase confers a broad resistance pattern similar to stably derepressed mutants of <em>Enterobacter</em>. </p><p>Over the past several years, carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes have been described in <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. These are encoded on transmissible plasmids, which facilitate their spread. In one report from New York City in 2005, 45 percent of 602 isolates of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> had a plasmid-encoded, extended spectrum beta-lactamase, and of those, 3.3 percent also carried a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase termed KPC-2 (<em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> carbapenemase-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a subsequent report from New York City in 2007, seven strains of <em>Escherichia coli</em> out of 1417 tested had a similar enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Resistance to the carbapenems in these strains was not always detected by currently available automated susceptibility methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-carbapenemase-producing-gram-negative-bacilli#H19876835\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli&quot;, section on 'Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)'</a>.)</p><p>The New Delhi metallo-&beta;-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) is another plasmid-mediated enzyme that mediates broad resistance to all currently available beta-lactams (including the carbapenems) and is linked to other resistance genes on the plasmid that confer resistance to all available antibiotics, with the exceptions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This enzyme was originally found in a number of Enterobacteriaceae in India and Pakistan, as well as in individuals returning to the UK, US, and other countries who have travelled there, particularly for medical care; they have now been described more broadly. These organisms have been referred to in the lay media as &quot;superbugs&quot; because of their extensive resistance.

Erythema multiforme is an acute eruption characterized by distinctive target skin lesions and diagnostic histology; when the mucosal surfaces are involved as well, the reaction is termed the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Exfoliative dermatitis is a severe skin disorder with generalized erythema and scaling. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is an acute severe reaction with widespread erythema and detachment of the epidermis; there may be a positive Nikolsky's sign. Hypersensitivity angiitis is a small vessel vasculitis involving mainly the venules of the skin and characterized by palpable purpura.

Penicillin neurotoxicity is characterized by a change in the level of consciousness (somnolence, stupor, or coma) with generalized hyperreflexia, myoclonus and seizures. This syndrome occurs with high-dose penicillin therapy (&gt;20 million units per day), particularly if excretion is delayed by underlying renal disease, or if preexisting neurologic disease is present. Penicillin neurotoxicity can potentially confuse the management of patients with bacterial meningitis.</p><p>High doses of the beta-lactam antibiotics (particularly penicillins, fourth generation cephalosporins, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>) may cause seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Decreased penetration to the plasma membrane target site and alterations in the penicillin binding proteins are other mechanisms of resistance.
