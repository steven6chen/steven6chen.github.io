Most of the evidence supporting the benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation has been derived from studies of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, results obtained in patients with respiratory diseases different from COPD have provided evidence that the benefits from pulmonary rehabilitation are also observed in symptomatic patients with other respiratory diseases. &#160;</p><p>The indications, goals, and components of pulmonary rehabilitation and the potential benefits for patients with chronic lung disease will be reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other therapeutic modalities, such as smoking cessation, oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, antibiotics, nutritional support, respiratory muscle training and resting, and cardiac rehabilitation, are discussed separately.

It is defined by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as a &quot;comprehensive intervention based on a thorough patient assessment followed by patient-tailored therapies that include, but are not limited to, exercise training, education, and behavior change, designed to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory disease and to promote the long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviors&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1647089517\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for pulmonary rehabilitation have not been precisely defined. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Disease suggests that pulmonary rehabilitation be included in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) categories B, C, and D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54300 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For respiratory diseases different from COPD, there have been no formal statements regarding patient selection, but it is common to consider pulmonary rehabilitation in symptomatic patients whose quality of life is impaired by their disease. </p><p>Frailty affects approximately one-fourth of patients with COPD and is a predictor of noncompletion of pulmonary rehabilitation. However, a study of 816 patients with stable COPD of whom 212 (26 percent) met criteria for frailty found that those who completed pulmonary rehabilitation experienced reduced dyspnea, improved exercise performance and physical activity level, and 61 percent no longer met criteria for frailty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, frailty is not necessarily a contraindication. Similarly, chronic hypercapnia due to advanced COPD is not a contraindication, as benefit has been demonstrated in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Contraindications to pulmonary rehabilitation are infrequent, but include conditions that would place the patient at increased risk during exercise (eg, uncontrolled cardiac disease) or present obstacles to participation (eg, severe arthritis, neurologic impairment, cognitive or psychosocial disorders) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Some patients with comorbid COPD and cardiac disease may be better suited to a cardiac rehabilitation program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation: Indications, efficacy, and safety in patients with coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3589101090\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPROGRAM EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program, each patient is assessed individually for severity of respiratory impairment, exercise tolerance, presence of comorbidities (especially cardiac, musculoskeletal, and neurologic disease), and cognitive-language-psychosocial problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. </p><p>Most pulmonary rehabilitation programs obtain preparticipation spirometry before and after bronchodilator, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and exercise capacity testing. These tests are used to enable an appropriate exercise prescription for the program and to provide a baseline for post program comparisons. For physical training to be successful, it must exceed the physical loads that the patient already encounters in daily life and, therefore, exercise programs need to be tailored to the individual. </p><p>One of several clinical tests of exercise capacity may be used, such as the six-minute walk test, the shuttle walk test, or cardiopulmonary exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a six-minute walk test, the patient walks as far as possible during a period of six minutes; the total distance walked (in meters), oxygen saturation during the walk, and dyspnea are monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a systematic analysis of four trials that measured six-minute walk distance before and after pulmonary rehabilitation, the mean improvement in the six-minute walk test was 107 meters (95% CI 84-129) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An increase of 35 meters or more is considered significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In an analysis of two trials that measured shuttle walk distance before and after pulmonary rehabilitation, the mean improvement in the shuttle walk test was 81 meters (95% CI 48-115) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In the rehabilitation setting, it is typically reserved for patients in whom the cause of dyspnea is unclear and for research studies. The peak oxygen uptake <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/min)</span> or the peak work power (Watts) achieved during a CPET can serve as a guide to determine the intensity of the training workload to target in individual exercise training. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536861051\"><span class=\"h1\">PRACTICAL ASPECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793185341\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary rehabilitation programs may be conducted in a hospital, outpatient, or home setting. Most of the research has involved outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programs with one to three visits per week. The optimal setting has not been determined and may vary with the patient and community. Increased exercise endurance following lower extremity exercise has been demonstrated in both hospital and home settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/15-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-27</a>]. </p><p>For some patients, pulmonary rehabilitation is initiated during a hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While ventilatory limitations may limit aerobic exercise, resistive muscle training has been well-tolerated in this setting and is associated with improved muscle strength and six-minute walk distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>]. Although there has been interest in starting rehabilitation early in patients admitted with respiratory failure to intensive care units, a randomized trial showed similar outcomes in the group of patients receiving early pulmonary rehabilitation compared with those receiving usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, it may be best to wait until the patient is stable to maximize the benefits of exercise training. Transportation issues and frailty may limit participation after discharge.</p><p>The number of sessions per week offered by the different types of programs varies; outpatient programs commonly meet two or three <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week,</span> while inpatient programs are usually planned for five <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that an eight week, home-based rehabilitation with telephone calls from a physiotherapist may achieve short-term improvements comparable to outpatient programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447203682\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During exercise training, dyspnea, breath sounds, diaphoresis, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation are monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Continuous telemetry is generally not used. If necessary, supplemental oxygen is added and titrated to an oxygen saturation &gt;88 percent. Blood glucose monitoring before and after exercise is prudent for patients with diabetes.</p><p>Exercise is interrupted if the patient develops severe dyspnea (eg, Borg score &ge;7), chest pain, lightheadedness, palpitations, tachycardia, hypotension, or refractory hypoxemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3641444690\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of a pulmonary rehabilitation program is uncertain. In one randomized trial, there was little difference between a four and seven week program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It is generally believed, however, that longer programs (eg, 8 to 12 weeks) confer more durable benefits with a minimum of eight weeks advised to achieve a substantial effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32,33</a>].</p><p>Improvement in functional exercise capacity seems to plateau within 12 weeks of the start of the pulmonary rehabilitation program, despite continued training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540299698\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational trials and common sense suggest that a program of exercise maintenance should provide additional benefits compared with a return to a pre-rehabilitation life-style. A multicenter trial randomly assigned 143 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> COPD to a weekly maintenance program or clinical follow-up for over three years, after an eight week conventional pulmonary rehabilitation program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. All patients improved significantly their exercise capacity, dyspnea, and health status after the basic eight week program. Marginal but significant differences were noted between the maintenance and control groups in BODE index and six-minute walk distance up to two years, but the benefit vanished after that time. Interestingly, no difference was found in mortality between the groups over the three years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2910339454\"><span class=\"h2\">Attendance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular attendance during a rehabilitation program is desirable, but not always possible. Factors found to decrease attendance include: current smoking, greater breathlessness, higher frequency of hospital admissions, shorter walked distance in the six-minute walk distance, longer duration of the program (eg, 18 versus 6 weeks), and longer journey time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary rehabilitation consists of exercise training, promotion of healthy behaviors (eg, smoking cessation, regular exercise, healthy nutrition, proper medication use, adherence to prescribed medications, and disease self-management), and psychological support (eg, improving self-efficacy and providing coping strategies for chronic illness).</p><p>Exercise limitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory diseases is multifactorial and includes ventilatory limitation, gas transfer abnormalities, pulmonary vascular and cardiac dysfunction, limb muscle dysfunction, and comorbid impairments such as those due to peripheral arterial disease and arthritis. Overall, pulmonary rehabilitation aims to improve cardiorespiratory and skeletal muscle function (eg, ambulation) and thereby reduce dyspnea and fatigue and improve quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3596965104\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal type of training for patients with lung disease has not been determined and may vary among individuals, but the majority of studies and programs have utilized endurance training. Interval training, and <span class=\"nowrap\">resistance/strength</span> training have also shown benefits and could be used in combination with or instead of endurance training. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3416641559\"><span class=\"h3\">Endurance training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endurance training (also known as conditioning) is the most common exercise training method employed in pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Endurance exercise can be performed using lower or upper extremity exercise, although lower extremity training (eg, stationary cycling, treadmill, or free walking) has been better studied and is at the center of most pulmonary rehabilitation programs. In general, the training load must be greater than the loads the patient experiences in daily life and should progress as the patient's endurance improves. Improving skeletal muscle function reduces the ventilatory demands of exercise and improve exercise capacity. </p><p>Endurance exercise training with an arm or leg ergometer is typically prescribed three to five times a week with continuous exercise for 20 to 30 minutes at 60 percent of the individual's maximal work rate or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, a patient who can achieve a maximal workload of 100 watts may target exercise at a workload of 60 to 70 watts continuously for the entire session. This intensity of exercise is usually associated with a dyspnea Borg score of 4 to 6, correlating with moderate to severe dyspnea or fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Lower extremity exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased exercise endurance has been demonstrated following lower extremity exercise programs in multiple controlled and uncontrolled studies performed in both hospital and home settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/15-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-25</a>]. </p><p>While the weight of evidence supports a role for lower extremity exercise in improving the functional status of patients with COPD, the optimal duration of the activity, frequency of the exercise sessions, and intensity of the task remain poorly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In general, studies demonstrating physiologic improvement tend to have the most intense exercise prescriptions. However, even patients with the most severe COPD and poor exercise performance can undergo exercise training. One study evaluated 50 patients with COPD who had a range of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) from 0.38 to 3.24 L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. An inverse relationship was observed between the baseline 12-minute walk distance and the improvement following exercise training.</p><p>The mechanism by which exercise improves endurance remains unclear. The benefits generally occur without change in pulmonary function tests or static respiratory muscle mechanics. Because of these observations, it was thought for many years that desensitization to dyspnea was the most important mechanism responsible for the observed benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, rigorous studies have proven that exercise training leads to biological and physiological changes in the skeletal muscles and the pattern of breathing of these patients that are responsible for the observed improvement.</p><p>One study with 11 participants demonstrated a true training effect based on the finding that an endurance training program led to skeletal muscle adaptation, characterized by an increased concentration of skeletal muscle oxidative enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another report showed reductions in exercise-induced lactic acidosis and ventilation after training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The improvement was proportional to the intensity of the training, with a 12 percent lower rise in lactic acidosis in patients trained at a low work rate versus a 32 percent lower rise in patients trained at a high work rate.</p><p>That the benefits of endurance training extend to the dynamics of breathing was borne out in a detailed physiological study of the respiratory pattern of breathing during exercise in patients with COPD. In that study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], at the same level of physical work (watts) before and after rehabilitation, patients who underwent exercise training had a lower respiratory rate, lower ventilatory requirement, and less dynamic lung hyperinflation. This allowed them to perceive less dyspnea and to increase their exercise endurance.</p><p>The absence of significant lactic acidosis during exercise does not preclude achieving a training effect. In a study of 25 patients with COPD who underwent a six week cycle ergometry exercise program, rehabilitation resulted in a mean increase of 36 percent in peak work rate and 77 percent in endurance on a constant work rate test despite the absence of significant metabolic acidosis during baseline testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A physiologic training effect was demonstrated by a lower heart rate response during constant work rate testing and evidence of faster kinetics of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, ie, the steady-state values were achieved sooner during exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Upper extremity exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of our knowledge about exercise conditioning is derived from programs emphasizing leg training. This is unfortunate, because the performance of many everyday tasks requires the use of hands plus the concerted action of other muscle groups that are used in upper torso and arm positioning. Some of these muscle groups serve a dual function (respiratory and postural), and use of the muscles for arm exercise decreases their capacity to participate in ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Arm training results in improved performance, which is mostly task specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Although some studies suggest a possible effect of arm training on respiratory muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], others found no change in ventilatory muscle performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/42,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48,49</a>].</p><p>In a study comparing different types of upper extremity exercise, unsupported arm training (against gravity) decreased oxygen uptake more than arm cranking training at the same workload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thus, unsupported arm exercise may be a more effective way of training patients in activities that resemble those of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a meta-analysis, unsupported upper extremity exercise decreased dyspnea and arm fatigue during activities of daily living, but did not result in a clinically important difference in the Borg scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Like lower extremity exercise, the optimal duration of the activity, frequency of the exercise sessions, and intensity of the task remain poorly defined for upper extremity exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3375640181\"><span class=\"h3\">Interval exercise training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During interval training, intervals of high intensity exercise are alternated with periods of rest or lower intensity exercise. An advantage of interval training is that individuals who are not able to reach the prescribed intensity or duration of endurance training due to severe dyspnea or oxygen desaturation may derive benefit from interval exercise training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. Regimens of interval training in pulmonary rehabilitation typically achieve a similar total work amount compared to continuous training and produce similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This was best illustrated by a trial that randomly assigned 98 patients with severe COPD to receive interval or continuous exercise training for three weeks, followed by exercise at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. At the end of the three weeks, the groups had similar improvement in quality of life and six-minute walking distance. However, adherence to the assigned protocol was higher in the interval training group (48 versus 24 percent).</p><p>In addition, a randomized trial of 42 patients with moderately severe COPD found that interval load exercise had a similar effect on BODE improvement compared with constant load exercise (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bode-index-for-copd-survival-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The optimal durations of high intensity and <span class=\"nowrap\">rest/low</span> intensity intervals are not known; intervals of high intensity exertion may need to be shorter than one minute to achieve a decreased dyspnea relative to endurance exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2654636536\"><span class=\"h3\">Resistance/strength training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Resistance/strength</span> training has a greater potential to improve muscle mass and strength than endurance training. During <span class=\"nowrap\">resistance/strength</span> training, individual muscle groups are trained by repetitive lifting of weights, selected based on the individual's capacity. The optimal approach to resistance training in pulmonary rehabilitation has not been determined, but preliminary evidence suggests that it provides additive benefit to endurance training. One potential benefit is that resistance exercise results in lower oxygen consumption and minute ventilation and evokes less dyspnea, which may be advantageous for patients who are less tolerant of endurance training.</p><p>Light weight training may provide additional benefit to endurance training. One report, for example, evaluated 14 patients with COPD enrolled in a home program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to daily walking while carrying a light backpack (controls) or the same regimen with additional weight lifting (wrist and arms curls, partial leg squats, calf raises, and supine dumbbell press) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. After training, weight lifters had reduced their minute ventilation and increased their ergometry endurance by 16 percent, when compared with controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3409946490\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative exercise training modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less conventional forms of exercise or muscle training may offer new avenues of therapy, such as breathing retraining, ventilatory muscle training, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, Tai Chi, and flexibility training.

Increased exercise tolerance, decreased dyspnea, and improved quality of life have been demonstrated in trials of pulmonary rehabilitation, although the magnitude and duration of benefits is less than in COPD. It has been suggested that ILD-focused educational content regarding the disease process, symptom management, oxygen use, medications, and end-of-life counselling would be helpful to participants with ILD, as pulmonary rehabilitation programs have traditionally focused on COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

A few small trials found that pulmonary rehabilitation led to improvements in outcomes such as inspiratory muscle strength, incremental shuttle walking distance, and endurance exercise capacity, compared with control.

The role of exercise training in PAH is less well-established than in other lung diseases due to concerns about syncope and sudden death. For patients with a good response to targeted therapy for PAH, low level (submaximal) exercise appears safe in a monitored setting and can lead to improvement in exertional dyspnea and in the six minute walk test distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-rehabilitation/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H995459723\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary rehabilitation, when coupled with smoking cessation, optimization of blood gases, and medication, is part of the optimal treatment program for patients with symptomatic airflow obstruction, particularly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) categories B, C, and D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54300 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1647089517\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program, each patient is assessed individually for severity of respiratory impairment, exercise tolerance, presence of comorbidities (especially cardiac, musculoskeletal, and neurologic disease), and cognitive-language-psychosocial problems. (See <a href=\"#H3589101090\" class=\"local\">'Preprogram evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower extremity endurance training (eg, cycling, walking) is of benefit in several areas of importance to patients with COPD, including exercise endurance, perception of dyspnea, and quality of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67751\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67751 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60099 \">figure 2</a>). Therefore, lower extremity endurance training should be part of all programs of pulmonary rehabilitation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lower extremity exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence from several small studies suggests that arm training is beneficial to patients who complain of symptoms when performing upper extremity exercise.

(See <a href=\"#H2654636536\" class=\"local\">'Resistance/strength training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less conventional forms of exercise or muscle training, such as breathing retraining, ventilatory muscle training, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, Tai Chi, and flexibility training, may offer new avenues of therapy. Further study is needed to define the role of these therapies in pulmonary rehabilitation.
