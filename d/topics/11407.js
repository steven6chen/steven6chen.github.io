He or she will measure your child's height and weight and use those measurements to calculate a number called the &quot;body mass index&quot; or &quot;BMI.&quot;</p><p>The doctor or nurse will use your child's BMI to tell if your child's weight is healthy for his or her height. To do this, the doctor or nurse will compare your child's BMI to the BMIs of other children of the same age and sex. If your child's BMI is high compared to other children, he or she is overweight. When a child's BMI is much too high, doctors sometimes use the terms &quot;obese&quot; or &quot;obesity.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426525\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is it important for my child to have a healthy weight?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to have a healthy weight, because children who are very overweight can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma &ndash; This is a lung condition that can make it hard to breathe.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee or back pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea &ndash; This is a condition that makes people stop breathing for short periods during sleep.</p><p/><p>It's also important that your child have a healthy weight so that he or she will have a healthy weight later in life. Being overweight as a teen or adult can lead to medical problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes (high blood sugar), heart attacks, and some types of cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426540\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes children to be overweight?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children can be overweight for different reasons. Some children simply gain weight more easily than other children. These children can become overweight by eating too much, eating unhealthy foods, or not getting enough exercise. When children gain weight very easily, they have to work extra hard to get to and stay at a healthy weight.</p><p>Although uncommon, some medicines and medical conditions can also make children gain weight more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426555\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests if he or she is overweight?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse will talk with you and your child, and do an exam. He or she might do blood tests to check for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition that could be causing your child to gain weight easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health problems that can happen when children are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426570\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I help my child get to a healthy weight?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help your child get to a healthy weight, you need to help him or her eat healthy foods and be more active. Making these lifestyle changes can be hard, especially at first. These are some goals you can work toward to help your child be healthier:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child eat 5 servings of fruits or vegetables each day. Frozen fruits and vegetables count towards the goal, but fruit juice does not. A serving is usually 1 whole fruit (such as an apple or banana) or a half cup of vegetables. If your child does not like vegetables or fruit, start slowly. Eat these foods yourself to set a good example, and have your child keep trying them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit your child's &quot;screen time.&quot; Screen time includes watching TV, playing video games, or using a computer or other electronic device for things other than homework. Experts recommend that young children (ages 2 to 5) have no more than 1 hour a day of screen time. Older children should also limit screen time. Spending too much time watching TV or using electronics raises a person's risk of being overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child do physical activity for 1 hour or more each day. This can include doing a sport, dancing, or playing outside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not give your child <strong>any</strong> sugary drinks. Sugary drinks include soda, sports drinks, and all juices.</p><p/><p>You and your child might not be able to meet all of these goals at first, but that's OK. Choose 1 or 2 goals to try first. Later on, you can try to meet all of these goals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426585\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything else I can do to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid bringing unhealthy food into your home. If you have unhealthy food in the home, your child is likely to eat it even if you tell him or her not to. Unhealthy foods include chips, cookies, pastries, and many other snack foods. It's OK for your child to eat these foods once in a while, but not too often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your child gets enough sleep. Some studies suggest that children who do not sleep enough are more likely to gain too much weight. In general, children 3 to 5 years old should get 10 to 13 hours of sleep (including naps). Older children should get 9 to 12 hours of sleep each night, and teens should get 8 to 10 hours. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To encourage sleep, it helps to have a set bedtime and wake-up time every day &ndash; even non-school days. It's also a good idea to have a quiet before-bed routine. Try not to let your child watch TV or play video games right before bedtime.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involve the whole family. Have everyone in the family eat healthier and be more active, even those who have a normal weight. Try to do physical activities as a family. This can be as simple as going to a playground or taking a walk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell your child that the goal is for him or her to be healthy and strong. Let him or her know that the way to be healthy and strong is to eat healthy food and be active.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get help if being overweight is causing your child to be sad, worried, or have a hard time in school. Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to get help for your child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work with your child's doctor or nurse. See him or her for regular check-ups, so that he or she can follow your child's BMI over time. Let the doctor or nurse know if you are having trouble meeting the above goals. He or she can help you get started or give you some tips. He or she might also recommend that you talk with a dietitian (food expert). A dietitian can help you choose healthy foods and plan meals.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12426600\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-apnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sleep apnea (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-surgery-and-procedures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss surgery and procedures (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
