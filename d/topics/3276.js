However, the true incidence of chancroid remains uncertain because a definitive diagnosis requires detection of the causative organism, <em>Haemophilus ducreyi</em>, and few laboratories have the capability of proper microbiologic diagnosis (eg, culture or nucleic acid amplification testing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, many sexually transmitted disease clinics do not attempt to diagnose genital ulcer disease caused by pathogens other than <em>Treponema pallidum</em> or herpes simplex virus.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of chancroid. Topic reviews that discuss the approach to patients with genital ulcer disease, syphilis, and genital herpes are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with genital ulcers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. ducreyi</em> is a small, fastidious, gram-negative rod that requires an enriched growth medium containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> and usually serum for successful cultivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cultures must be delivered expeditiously to the laboratory and incubated at 33&ordm; to 35&ordm;C in high humidity with CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. Small, heterogeneous colonies appear on culture medium after 48 to 72 hours. The gray to tan translucent colonies slide intact across the agar plate when pushed.</p><p>When examined by Gram stain, organisms from culture often clump in long parallel strands, producing a so-called &quot;school of fish&quot; or &quot;railroad track&quot; appearance. This morphology can occasionally be seen in Gram-stained smears from clinical specimens, but it is not a consistent or reliable clinical finding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2408948042\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of chancroid is incompletely understood. In the vast majority of cases, organisms are thought to gain access to tissues via microabrasions in the skin that occur during sexual intercourse, since <em>H. ducreyi</em> does not typically infect intact skin. However, the organism has also been identified as a cause of cutaneous ulcers in children and young adults on islands in the South Pacific Islands and in parts of equatorial Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p><em>H. ducreyi</em> is a highly infectious bacterium. The likelihood that inoculation will lead to papule formation appears to be mainly influenced by inoculum dose and host factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Data from a human model of experimental infection demonstrates that inoculation of a single colony forming unit (cfu) results in papule formation in 50 percent of cases; inoculation of 100 cfu leads to papule formation in 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The initiation of infection requires attachment of bacteria to susceptible cells, a process that appears to involve the interaction of a protein mediator (probably pili) and lipooligosaccharide with fibronectin contained in the extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Bacterial adherence to cells then occurs via the elaboration of a heat shock protein (GroEL), which may also contribute to the bacterial chaining described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p>A cytotoxin secreted by <em>H. ducreyi</em> may then play an important role in epithelial cell injury and subsequent development of an ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This cytotoxin, present in the majority of strains, has been found to be similar to cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) from other bacterial species, including <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, and <em>Actinobacillus</em> <em>actinomycetemcomitans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similar to other CDTs, this toxin causes distension of cultured epithelial cells and fibroblasts, leading to irreversible cell-cycle arrest in the G2 phase of cell growth.</p><p>The histologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of chancroid lesions were described in a 1996 report of 11 men, 5 of whom were coinfected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A superficial purulent exudate was typically present in the epidermis, and a perivascular and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate was seen in the dermis. Neutrophils were prominent in most patients who were not HIV-infected, but were less common in those who were HIV-positive. The mononuclear cell infiltrate contains many CD4+ lymphocytes, which may explain the increased risk of HIV transmission among persons with chancroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chancroid is a rare infection in the United States and most other developed countries, although it can occur in localized outbreaks while remaining endemically absent in most areas. In such settings, there can also be occasional imported cases, which were acquired in endemic areas. However, the true incidence of chancroid remains unclear because of the difficulty isolating <em>H. ducreyi</em> in the laboratory. In addition, most facilities do not test for this organism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">United States and developed countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted, chancroid is infrequently identified as a cause of genital ulcer disease in developed countries, and, when it has appeared in recent decades, it has generally been in the setting of a localized epidemic, with modest to large numbers of cases. Thus, clinicians and public health agencies must still remain on alert for its reintroduction.</p><p>In the United States, chancroid has been diagnosed primarily in minority populations (African Americans or Hispanics), in heterosexuals, and among female sex workers and their clients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/1,3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,18</a>]. Cases are more commonly reported in men, at least in part because chancroid is more easily diagnosed in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and uncircumcised men have the highest incidence of infection. Crack cocaine and the exchange of sex for drugs have been implicated in several outbreaks. </p><p>There were only seven cases of chancroid reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Cases were reported from six states: Massachusetts (1), California (2), Colorado (1), Alabama (1), North Carolina (1), and South Carolina (1). In a report from a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Paris, France, only 8 of 278 cases of genital ulcer disease evaluated between 1995 and 2005 were diagnosed as being caused by <em>H. ducreyi</em>, and no cases of chancroid were diagnosed after 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, during recognized outbreaks, chancroid has accounted for up to 20 percent of patients presenting to public STD clinics with genital ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/18,19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,23,24</a>].</p><p>While the absence of reported cases of chancroid most likely represents the rarity of this infection, it is important to note that lack of testing may contribute to the apparent disappearance of chancroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/19,23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23-27</a>]. Limited data suggest that very few patients evaluated in STD facilities are tested for chancroid. As an example, in 1996, a survey of 405 STD treatment facilities in the United States found that only 32 (8 percent) tested patients for chancroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is unlikely that this proportion has increased in recent years.</p><p>The potential significance of this lack of testing was demonstrated in a study conducted from 1988 to 1990 in New York, where <em>H. ducreyi</em> caused 27 of 65 cases (42 percent) of genital ulcer disease when a microbiologic diagnosis was established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a report of 299 men with nonsyphilitic genital ulcer disease from New Orleans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; cultures revealed <em>H. ducreyi</em> in 39 percent and herpes simplex virus in 19 percent; culture were negative in 41 percent. These data exemplify the episodic nature of chancroid outbreaks.</p><p>Use of nucleic acid amplification testing also suggests that chancroid may be more common than previously believed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23,24</a>]. In 1996, data obtained using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction test demonstrated that <em>H. ducreyi</em> tended to occur in epidemiologic clusters and accounted for a substantial proportion of genital ulcer cases when present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As an example, cases of chancroid were identified in Memphis and Chicago and accounted for 20 and 12 percent of all cases of genital ulcers in these cities, respectively. However, in Memphis, the diagnosis of chancroid was not made in any of the patients when clinical criteria were used, and only two of these patients were prescribed an antibiotic regimen that would treat chancroid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Developing countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although definitive epidemiologic data are not generally available, chancroid has been considered a major cause of genital ulcer disease in sub-Saharan Africa and in many parts of Southeast Asia and Latin America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/1,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28-30</a>]. However, the prevalence of chancroid has dramatically declined in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/31-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-38</a>], including Thailand, Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, and Tanzania. One potential explanation for this observation is the widespread use of the World Health Organization's guidelines for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, where treatment algorithms are based upon the identification of consistent groups of symptoms and easily recognized signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>Non-sexually transmitted cutaneous ulcer disease caused by <em>H. ducreyi</em> has been identified in children and young adults (and in some visitors) from islands in the South Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Vanuatu, where the cutaneous ulcer disease yaws is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/6,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,40-42</a>]. Identification of the pathogen occurred as part of mass drug administration programs for yaws and trachoma, where <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> was given and nucleic acid amplification diagnostic tools were used to assess the etiology of cutaneous ulcers in the treated population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3653316944\"><span class=\"h2\">Genital ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period of chancroid is typically 4 to 10 days (range 1 to 35 days). Infection with <em>H. ducreyi</em> leads to an erythematous papule that rapidly evolves into a pustule, which erodes into an ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/1,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,43</a>]. Infected persons commonly have more than one ulcer, and the lesions are almost always confined to the genital area and its draining lymph nodes.</p><p>At presentation, a typical chancroid ulcer is about 1 to 2 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76843 \">picture 1</a>), but the size is variable and there may be more than one ulcer present, especially in HIV-infected patients. The ulcer is painful and has an erythematous base; the borders are clearly demarcated and sometimes undermined. The base of the ulcer is usually covered with a gray or yellow purulent exudate and bleeds when scraped.</p><p>As predicted by the pathogenesis of <em>H. ducreyi</em> infections, the most common sites for chancroid are those that are typically subject to friction during sex. In men, most lesions involve the prepuce, corona, or glans penis. In women, the labia, vaginal introitus, and perianal areas are most commonly affected. Some cases of chancroid may go undiagnosed, especially in asymptomatic women with vaginal or cervical lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H970260704\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inguinal lymphadenitis is present in about one-half of infected men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76843 \">picture 1</a>), but is somewhat less common in women. The involved nodes may undergo liquefaction and present as fluctuant buboes. Most buboes arise one to two weeks after the appearance of the primary ulcer and are often quite painful. Untreated buboes may spontaneously rupture and discharge frank pus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3092641697\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-sexually transmitted cutaneous ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-sexually transmitted cutaneous ulcer disease caused by <em>H. ducreyi</em> has been identified in Yaws-endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], although there is no apparent pathogenetic connection to yaws. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Developing countries'</a> above.)</p><p>Compared with the lesions of yaws, cutaneous ulcers caused by <em>H. ducreyi</em> are less circular in shape, and are less likely to have central granulating tissue indurated edges. In addition, most lesions are on the limbs rather than the torso. The cutaneous manifestations of yaws are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yaws-bejel-and-pinta#H12097892\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Yaws, bejel, and pinta&quot;, section on 'Yaws'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058971904\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most providers rely on clinical criteria to make a diagnosis of chancroid in patients with clinical manifestations consistent with infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The diagnosis of chancroid is challenging since most sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment centers do not have the capability of testing for <em>H. ducreyi</em>. (See <a href=\"#H979037146\" class=\"local\">'Tests to identify the organism'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the sensitivity and specificity of using clinical criteria to make a probable diagnosis of chancroid is variable, and the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis ranges from 33 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/18,28,29,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28,29,44</a>]. Thus, if a diagnosis of chancroid is being considered, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of genital ulcer disease, such as <em>T. pallidum</em> and herpes simplex virus (HSV), which are more likely to occur. In addition, coinfection with <em>H. ducreyi</em> and other sexually transmitted infections have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chancroid/abstract/14,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,26</a>].
