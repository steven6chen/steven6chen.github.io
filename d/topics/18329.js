The caruncle is a small, fleshy mass that is soft, smooth or friable, and bright red to dark pink. These are generally single and sessile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80179\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80179 \">picture 1</a>), but they can also be pedunculated and grow to 1 to 2 cm. Caruncles typically occur in postmenopausal women and hypoestrogenism is the proposed mechanism. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and histology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urethral prolapse</strong> &ndash; Urethral prolapse refers to urethral mucosa that is circumferentially everted around the meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The condition typically occurs in premenarcheal girls and in postmenopausal women as well. The tissue can also be friable, ulcerated, and edematous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Urethral prolapse'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urethral polyp</strong> &ndash; Urethral polyps are more common in boys, but cases have been reported in prepubertal girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. While urethral polyps can arise from any part of the urethra in girls, in boys the lesions mainly arise from the prostatic urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In girls, urethral polyps are benign fibroepithelial polyps that are thought to be congenital and often present as interlabial masses.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of urethral caruncles is not well understood. A distal segment of the urethral mucosa, most commonly the posterior lip of the urethral meatus, prolapses to form the caruncle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Estrogen deficiency after menopause results in atrophy of the uroepithelium, which appears to be a predisposing factor, possibly by causing retraction of the postmenopausal vagina. Chronic inflammation of the exposed, prolapsed urethral mucosa may lead to enlargement, bleeding, and necrosis. Secondary infection can also occur.</p><p>Histologically, urethral caruncles contain a core of blood vessels and loose connective tissue covered by hyperplastic urothelial and squamous epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Chronic irritation of the prolapsed segment of mucosa results in a dense inflammatory infiltrate. The stromal component may be associated with variable degrees of edema, vascularity, red blood cell extravasation, and fibrosis; dilated blood vessels may contain organizing thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Urethral caruncles are subclassified as granulomatous, papillomatous, or angiomatous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17643364\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incidental finding</strong> &mdash; Many women with urethral caruncles are asymptomatic, and the caruncle is identified as an incidental finding during genital examination. Most patients are postmenopausal women, with occasional occurrences in premenopausal women and prepubertal girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-12</a>]. Affected males have been described in single case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. In one study, an asymptomatic urethral caruncle was noted in 50 of 850 women (6 percent) who presented with urinary incontinence; all of the caruncles were &lt;1 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic women</strong> &mdash; Symptomatic women may present when they discover a lump at the urethral meatus or because of symptoms such as light bleeding, dysuria, pain, or obstruction to urine flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>]. Microscopic hematuria and postmenopausal bleeding are other presentations. Bleeding may be associated with urination or it may be noted on toilet paper, feminine hygiene pads, or underclothes. In a review of 394 women presenting with caruncles and malignant urethral lesions, bleeding was the most common complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Urinary obstruction was more common in women with a malignant urethral neoplasm than in those with a caruncle.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17643228\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lesion examination</strong> &ndash; The caruncle generally appears as a soft pink or red, sessile or pedunculated, polyploid nodule protruding from a segment of the urethral meatus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80179\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80179 \">picture 1</a>). The exophytic mass is covered by epithelium and is usually &lt;1 to 2 cm in greatest dimension. It may be friable, ulcerated, velvety, or hemorrhagic. Thrombosed lesions are deep blue, purple, or black.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urethral evaluation</strong> &ndash; The urethra should be palpated to assess for induration (suggestive of malignancy) or the presence of additional lesions not visible externally. Cystourethroscopy is indicated for further evaluation of the urethra if palpation reveals abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic cystourethroscopy for gynecologic conditions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urinalysis</strong> &ndash; Urinalysis should be obtained to look for hematuria and a urine culture is indicated in patients with hematuria or dysuria. Although a caruncle may cause microscopic or gross hematuria, women with hematuria are also evaluated for possible malignancy of the kidneys and urinary tract. This evaluation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biopsy</strong> &ndash; Biopsy of the urethral mass is not required for diagnosis, but excisional biopsy is indicated if the mass is irregular, firm, or has other characteristics suspicious for malignancy (eg, induration, local extension, inguinal adenopathy, increasing size, failure to respond to topical estrogen cream).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Additional evaluation</strong> &ndash; As bleeding is a common symptom of urethral caruncles, it is important to consider the possibility of concurrent, potentially malignant causes of postmenopausal bleeding. The extent of evaluation depends on patient-specific factors (eg, associated symptoms, amount of bleeding, findings on pelvic exam, risk factors) and response to treatment of the caruncle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postmenopausal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postmenopausal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of urethral caruncle can be based on characteristic findings on physical examination: a soft pink or red, sessile or pedunculated, exophytic mass protruding from the urethral meatus, usually &lt;1 to 2 cm in size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80179\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80179 \">picture 1</a>). For women in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, biopsy is performed under local anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17643228\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caruncles can often be differentiated from other urethral lesions by their physical characteristics. If the diagnosis is uncertain or the lesion is not characteristic of urethral caruncle, biopsy is performed. In one of the largest series of urethral neoplasms, 9 of 394 excised urethral lesions (2.4 percent) thought to be benign caruncles were found to be malignant after histopathological examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Varices may cause hematuria and may prolapse or thrombose (&quot;urethral hemorrhoid&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Compressing and releasing the varices should transiently disrupt blood flow, which helps to confirm the diagnosis of a vascular lesion.

We suggest routine specialty evaluation of women in whom the diagnosis is not clear, who do not respond to topical estrogen treatment or have persistent bleeding, or who have features suggestive of malignancy (eg, induration, increasing size, abnormal urethral exam). These women can require excision or biopsy for definitive diagnosis and directed treatment. In my practice, the most common reason for referral is persistent bleeding.</p><p>Most women with urethral caruncle are asymptomatic and don&rsquo;t require intervention. For women who are symptomatic, initial care can often be managed by nonspecialists. (See <a href=\"#H17642946\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic lesions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17642882\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic women with caruncles that appear typical and benign do not require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17642946\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with benign and typical-appearing caruncles who have symptoms (eg, bleeding, irritation, and dysuria) warrant treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17642875\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For first-line treatment of symptomatic patients, we suggest use of a topical estrogen cream for two to three months. The patient should apply a fingertip amount (ie, about 0.3 mg) of estrogen cream to the caruncle once daily for two weeks and then twice per week for two to three months. Low-dose vaginal estrogen has few risks, and women using it do not require progestin treatment for endometrial protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Alternate treatment modalities include cryosurgery, laser therapy, or fulguration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The optimal treatment is not known as comparative studies are lacking. In a retrospective review of 24 women who underwent surgical excision of urethral prolapse (not caruncle), three patients (12.5 percent) had visible recurrence, one of whom underwent repeat excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Complications included postoperative bleeding (six women, 25 percent), placement of a bladder catheter to tamponade urethral bleeding (one woman, 4 percent), and placement of a bladder catheter for relief of temporary urinary retention (one woman, 4 percent). It is not known if postoperative topical estrogen treatment reduces the risk of recurrence.</p><p>Excision is performed by sharply excising the mass at the base. If the resulting mucosal defect is small, the edges can be reapproximated with a small (eg, 3-0 or 4-0) synthetic absorbable monofilament suture. If the defect is large, the edge of the urethral mucosa is everted onto the adjacent vaginal epithelium to minimize the risk of meatal stenosis, which is a potential complication of this procedure. A bladder catheter is usually left in place for several days in women who require mobilization of the urethral mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17642904\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrrent lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic recurrence can be treated by excision or repeat use of topical estrogen.

A review of 41 female patients with an average age of 68 years (range 28 to 81) reported a 7 percent recurrence rate after surgical excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of note, 20 subjects tried topical medications as first-line treatment without response, and all went on to excision. In this review, there were no malignancies or cytologic atypia found histologically in the surgical specimen.</p><p>A review of 46 girls aged 1.5 to 10 years treated for urethral prolapse (not caruncle) reported that medical treatment was successful in 11 of 15 girls (73 percent) treated with a topical antibiotic and steroid cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-caruncle/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Repeated medical treatment was successful in two of four recurrences, while the other two patients went on to surgical excision.
