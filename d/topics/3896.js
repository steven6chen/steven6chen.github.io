Patients included in this category, who have these findings in common, include those with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis, SpA related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the subset of patients with such manifestations who do not meet established definitions for these forms of SpA. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA are not included within the peripheral SpA category, even if peripheral manifestations of musculoskeletal involvement are also present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>A clear distinction between the clinically defined subsets of patients with peripheral SpA is often lacking, other than for those with PsA. As examples, in a considerable number of patients skin manifestations of psoriasis do not occur until after the manifestation of rheumatic symptoms; preceding infections may be clinically asymptomatic, as an example, with Chlamydia; and IBD can also be asymptomatic when patients present with musculoskeletal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of peripheral SpA in adults will be presented here. The treatment of peripheral SpA; the classification of SpA; and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial SpA, PsA, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with IBD, and SpA in children are discussed in more detail separately.

Study results vary widely between different populations and ethnic groups, which can at least partly be explained by differences in the prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)B27. Other important contributors to these differences are heterogeneity in the populations analyzed, variation in the criteria used for case definition, and the number of participants approached and included in each study.</p><p>The prevalence of SpA was estimated to be 0.43 percent in a large population-based cohort representative of the French population, consisting of 20,625 employees of the French national electricity and gas company [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; the proportion with peripheral SpA was 25 percent, consistent with a prevalence estimate within the French population of 0.11 percent.</p><p>Incidence and prevalence figures for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and reactive arthritis have been reported, although overlap with axial disease might be present. The incidence of PsA varies from 0.1 per 100,000 person-years in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] to 23.1 per 100,000 person-years in Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Those of greatest importance, as reflected by the classification criteria for peripheral SpA, include the three peripheral musculoskeletal manifestations, which are arthritis (predominantly of the lower extremities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asymmetric), enthesitis, and dactylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of similar importance are other features, including uveitis and the presence of psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/ulcerative</span> colitis) or a history of an infection that may trigger reactive arthritis. Other features that may be present, but which are of lesser importance in the classification scheme, are a history of inflammatory back pain (IBP) in the past and a family history of SpA, which is defined as the presence in a first- or second-degree relative of SpA, uveitis, reactive arthritis, psoriasis, or IBD. (See <a href=\"#H61262077\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H61262641\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory eye disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H61262647\" class=\"local\">'Inflammation of the bowel mucosa'</a> below and <a href=\"#H102212580\" class=\"local\">'Psoriasis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the clinical picture is often very similar, patients with psoriasis, IBD, and reactive arthritis each do have some features specific for their diseases which are described in detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

The other musculoskeletal manifestation that may be present is back pain, including IBP, current or in the past. The back pain, however, is not a dominant feature compared with the peripheral symptoms and findings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral arthritis</strong> &ndash; Peripheral arthritis is present in most patients with peripheral SpA. The peripheral arthritis in SpA is usually chronic, and predominantly involves the lower extremities, especially the knees and ankles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19,20</a>]. However, any joint can be involved. Arthritis is asymmetric in about 70 percent of patients and often affects only one to three joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A small percentage of patients have involvement of four or more joints. When compared with other rheumatic diseases, the sensitivity and specificity of asymmetric oligoarthritis for SpA were found to be 41 and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enthesitis (enthesopathy)</strong> &ndash; Enthesitis is a hallmark clinical feature of SpA (and also of psoriatic arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Enthesitis (or enthesopathy) refers to inflammation around the enthesis, which is the site of insertion of ligaments, tendons, joint capsule, or fascia to the surface of the bone, and is relatively specific to SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although enthesitis is less common than peripheral arthritis, it is still present in about 50 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most noticeable clinical manifestation of enthesitis is swelling at the heels, either at the insertion of the Achilles tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81198\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81198 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F96430\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96430 \">picture 1</a>) or at the insertion of the plantar fascia ligament into the calcaneus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is usually associated with severe pain and tenderness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During physical examination, the patient often has difficulty walking on the heels when barefoot. Swelling at the side of the Achilles tendon may be appreciated when the patient is observed in the standing position from behind. On palpation, there is tenderness at the sites of insertion of the Achilles tendon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> of the plantar fascia on the calcaneus. Other sites of enthesitis that don't become swollen, but which can be tender, include those at the iliac crests, greater trochanters, epicondyles at the elbows, tibial plateaus, costochondral junctions at the sternum, humeral tuberosities, manubrial-sternal joints, occiput, and spinous processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dactylitis (sausage digits)</strong> &ndash; Dactylitis, also known sausage toe or sausage finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61696\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61696 \">picture 2</a>), is an uncommon but characteristic feature of peripheral SpA. It is most often found in association with psoriasis. Unlike synovitis, in which swelling is confined to the joints, with dactylitis the entire digit is swollen. Joints do not show the discrete palpable fusiform swelling of synovitis, and there may be surprisingly little pain or tenderness. The diffuse swelling arises from flexor tendon, sheath, and marked adjacent soft tissue involvement. Dactylitis is not specific for SpA and may also be seen in other conditions, including tuberculosis, syphilis, sarcoidosis, sickle cell disease, and tophaceous gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory back pain</strong> &ndash; A pattern of back discomfort referred to as IBP is characteristic of axial SpA, but by definition is not the predominant feature of peripheral SpA, although at least 14 percent of patients with predominantly peripheral symptoms have a history of back pain in the past that is consistent with IBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. IBP is considered present in patients with at least four of the following five features: an insidious onset, onset before the age of 40 years, improvement with exercise, a lack of improvement with rest, and pain at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Conjunctivitis is typically transient with symptoms subsiding within a few weeks. A more serious problem is anterior uveitis (iritis), which is mostly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The initial attack of uveitis is usually acute and unilateral and may be the presenting problem. Patients typically note redness, pain, and photophobia. Although ocular inflammation often responds to topical therapy, permanent impairment of vision is possible if treatment is unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An accurate diagnosis and optimal management of uveitis requires slit lamp examination by an ophthalmologist or other expert in uveitis.

In patients with IBD, the peripheral arthritis can be associated with skin, oral mucosal, and ocular manifestations of IBD.

In addition, patients with peripheral SpA may also have one or more of the following: psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), anterior uveitis, an association with prior or ongoing infection, sacroiliitis by imaging, a past history of axial pain, a family history of SpA, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. (See <a href=\"#H61262047\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H61262955\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H61263419\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of peripheral SpA is made in a patient with one of the characteristic musculoskeletal findings (arthritis, enthesitis, or dactylitis), usually with one or more other characteristically associated findings, and, very importantly, after exclusion of conditions that may strongly resemble peripheral SpA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should be monitored during follow-up for additional elements suggesting SpA or features of a condition in the differential diagnosis. The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) classification criteria for SpA provide helpful guidance but have insufficient sensitivity and specificity for use as the sole diagnostic tool. Diagnosis cannot be made by a checklist of items. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of peripheral SpA includes rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), gout, Achilles tendinopathy, non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, ankle sprain and its sequelae, dactylitis of sarcoidosis and sickle cell disease, and Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rudwaleit M, van der Heijde D, Landew&eacute; R, et al.
