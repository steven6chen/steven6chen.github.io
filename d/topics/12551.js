It is estimated that as of January 2016, there were 15.5 million people with a history of cancer in the United States, and the number is expected to increase to 20 million by 2026 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>For female cancer survivors, gynecologic issues are a major concern and many of these issues impact sexual function. Sexual health conditions that affect women during or after cancer treatment may be considered according to the same categories as female sexual dysfunction in the general population. The American Psychiatric Association defines the following female sexual disorders: sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal,</span> orgasmic, and genitopelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/penetration</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Each of these categories of function can be impacted by cancer and its treatments.</p><p>The general approach to sexual health issues associated with cancer treatment involves patient education, screening, diagnosis, and management. </p><p>This topic will review sexual health issues in women diagnosed with and treated for cancer. Female sexual dysfunction in general, fertility preservation in cancer patients, and infertility and pregnancy outcomes in cancer survivors are discussed separately.

In the general population, 40 percent of women have sexual complaints, although a clinical diagnosis of sexual dysfunction requires that the sexual issue is associated with personal distress, and this is not assessed in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

The principal mechanisms include: inducing hypoestrogenism, altering anatomy, mucosal alterations from chemotherapy or radiation, or causing vaginal obstruction. The emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis and treatment also has a profound effect on sexual health for many women. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802895\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical treatment can result in distortions of female anatomy, particularly for patients with breast or gynecologic cancers. </p><p>Many women with gynecologic cancer undergo hysterectomy. Hysterectomy for ovarian or endometrial cancer is typically an extrafascial hysterectomy, with no significant shortening of the vagina. Extrafascial hysterectomy for benign indications is not associated with adverse effects on sexual function. Radical hysterectomy may impair sexual function through neurological damage, resulting in loss of sensation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some surgical procedures for gynecologic cancer (vulvectomy, vaginectomy) may make vaginal intercourse impossible or result in loss of sensation or pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-wide-local-excision-simple-vulvectomy-and-skinning-vulvectomy#H1061998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar wide local excision, simple vulvectomy, and skinning vulvectomy&quot;, section on 'Effects on sexual function and body image'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Bilateral oophorectomy in premenopausal women leads to premature menopause with resultant hormonal and physical changes that can alter several domains of sexual function. The effect of oophorectomy on sexual function in women who are already menopausal is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Age and menopause'</a>.)</p><p>Breast lumpectomy, mastectomy, and reconstruction may result in body image changes or loss of sensation. Some women undergo nipple-sparing surgery to preserve breast appearance or sensation. However, data are inconsistent regarding the effect of breast-conserving treatment versus mastectomy in terms of sexual effects. As an example, a prospective study of 149 women with breast cancer reported that following treatment, compared with pretreatment reports, decreased sexual arousal was found in women treated with breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy, and issues with sexual desire and orgasm were found in those who underwent mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In comparison with healthy controls, no significant differences in sexual functioning were found after breast-conserving therapy, while significantly more women who underwent mastectomy reported problems with sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer#H463691037\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Menopausal symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802902\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy can result in systemic effects that decrease both sexual desire and arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one study of 864 breast cancer survivors, sexual dysfunction occurred more frequently in women of all ages who had received chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Chemotherapy may induce ovarian failure with a sudden temporary or permanent loss of estrogen. Near total alopecia due to some agents, such as the anthracyclines and taxanes, can affect a patient's perception of sexual attractiveness, while others may cause vaginal or rectal mucosal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Less is known about the effects of chemotherapy on the vulva or vagina. Some women may experience a persistent vaginal discharge following chemotherapy, likely representing vaginal mucositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This may result in avoidance of sexual activity due to the presence of discharge or it may be associated with dyspareunia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802909\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) can also impact sexual function in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. For example, RT for breast cancer induces local skin thickening, contractures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes in texture and color, and may result in chronic breast pain, any of which can affect a woman's body image or ability to enjoy sexual activity. </p><p>Vaginal fibrosis may result from RT to the pelvis with resultant vaginal fibrosis or stenosis that limits a woman's capacity for vaginal intercourse and affects her genital pelvic and clitoral sensitivity during sexual activity. These changes last long after RT has completed. For example, sexual dysfunction has been reported out to five years of follow-up in women treated with RT for cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1803082\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocrine therapy that induces menopause (eg, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists) or alters estrogen action (selective estrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors) may result in vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. These may also be associated with decreased libido. In one study, dyspareunia was reported by 56.5 percent of women on aromatase inhibitors and 31.3 percent of those on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The impact of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy varies depending upon menopausal status. This may result in a variable impact depending upon whether the patient is premenopausal, has residual ovarian function after natural menopause, or has little or no ovarian endocrine function following oophorectomy, pelvic radiation, or chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy#H752607322\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding and uterine pathology in women on tamoxifen therapy&quot;, section on 'Endometrial and menstrual effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802923\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oncologic treatment results in secondary effects that may impact sexual function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515622776\"><span class=\"h3\">Menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer treatment in premenopausal women often results in menopause. In 2016, 12 percent of female cancer survivors were diagnosed with cancer at &lt;50 years old (51 years is the average age of menopause) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Menopause is associated with hypoestrogenism and resultant vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Menopausal women are also more likely to have low libido [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The physiology of decreased sexual desire after menopause is not fully understood. After natural menopause, estrogen levels drop precipitously, but there is no significant decrease in testosterone levels (testosterone levels decrease slowly, starting from age 20 to 30 years). However, women treated with oophorectomy, pelvic radiation, or some types of chemotherapy lose all ovarian function. The adrenal gland is not typically radiosensitive or adversely impacted by chemotherapy, thus adrenal androgen production continues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Endocrinology'</a>.) </p><p>Based upon the loss of ovarian function, it is possible that cancer survivors may have a more severe effect. Studies of the differential effect on libido of natural menopause versus surgical menopause have yielded inconsistent results. One study that compared menopausal women with or without a history of cancer (82 percent were breast cancer survivors) found that cancer survivors had more severe vasomotor symptoms, but no significant difference in loss of sexual interest (44 percent in survivors versus 49 percent in controls) or pain with sexual activity (27 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515628063\"><span class=\"h3\">Graft-versus-host disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may develop vulvovaginal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This may result in dyspareunia, vulvar lesions, or vaginal adhesions and obstruction. Adhesion formation may be asymptomatic until the patient notes the presence of vaginal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In mild cases with no vulvar lesions or vaginal adhesions, it is difficult to differentiate vulvovaginal GVHD from vulvovaginal atrophy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515622783\"><span class=\"h3\">Vulvodynia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvodynia may have a variety of eliciting factors, including menopause. Localized, provoked, or generalized vulvodynia may develop following chemotherapy or menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. There is some evidence that chemotherapy contributes to vulvodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In our practice, we have seen a higher prevalence of vulvodynia, particularly vestibulodynia, in women who have been treated with chemotherapy than in a general gynecologic clinic population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-localized-vulvar-pain-syndrome-formerly-vulvodynia-vestibulodynia-vulvar-vestibulitis-or-focal-vulvitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of localized vulvar pain syndrome (formerly vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, vulvar vestibulitis, or focal vulvitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515622796\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginismus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who develop dyspareunia after cancer may develop secondary vaginismus as a result of painful sexual experiences.

In addition, anatomic or functional changes due to treatment or the impact of a cancer diagnosis itself results in body image alterations for many patients. This often impacts the patient's concept of attractiveness or identity as a sexual person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As an example, in a study of breast cancer survivors, validated questionnaire results found body satisfaction to be lower than normative values, and increased body change distress was associated with mastectomy and posttreatment weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Another key factor in sexual function is relationship issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For women with a partner at the time of cancer diagnosis, the treatment process may result in stress or shift in the relationship. In our experience, partners often shift into a caregiver role that lacks the previous sexual dynamic or may fear that sexual activity will hurt the patient. Many women voice concern that alterations in their sexual function (anatomic, decreased libido) may lead to the dissatisfaction in their partner and may result in the loss of the relationship.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515623309\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary or bowel dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer treatment, particularly if pelvic surgery or radiation is involved, may impair urinary or bowel function. Urinary or anal incontinence or the presence of a urostomy or colostomy may lead to embarrassment or avoidance of sexual activity. Screening for these issues should be part of posttreatment care, and further evaluation and management should be provided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer#H25842894\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the long-term survivor of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515623860\"><span class=\"h3\">Other etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Etiologies of sexual dysfunction that are not related to oncologic care may be present in cancer survivors. This is particularly true in women with a history of sexual issues prior to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of sexual pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dyspareunia may result from complications or effects of pelvic surgery, including a pelvic hematoma or abscess or adhesions. In our experience, we have not seen a cancer recurrence present as a sexual issue. However, women with a new onset of pelvic pain or genital tract bleeding should be evaluated for recurrent disease, as appropriate for primary tumor site. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5486466\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING AND COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual health issues should be addressed throughout cancer care. This requires screening, counseling, and evaluation and treatment. </p><p>The Unites States National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Survivorship Guidelines advise clinicians to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask about vaginal dryness and sexual function at regular intervals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the Brief Sexual Symptom Checklist as a primary screening tool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98403 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review present and past sexual activity and sexual concerns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss how treatment has affected sexual functioning and intimacy</p><p/><p>Patients may present with sexual complaints, but often they do not bring these to medical attention. Many women feel embarrassed to ask about these issues, or they may feel that they are alone is experiencing such problems or are not aware that treatment is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, patients may be concerned that their oncologist will perceive that these issues are trivial or that the patient is ungrateful for their care. As an example, in one study, almost 50 percent of participants had experienced at least one sexual problem, but only 19 percent attempted to seek medical help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Barriers to screening for sexual issues include limited time with the oncologist, having many other high-priority issues to discuss, and a lack of comfort and training with these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As an example, Wiggins et al conducted a survey of gynecologic oncologists and found that less than half made it a practice to take a sexual history in new patients, and 80 percent did not feel there was sufficient time to devote to exploring sexual issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Only 20 percent felt they had sufficient time to speak to their patients about these issues, which was the sentiment of both male (85 percent) and female (73 percent) respondents. </p><p>Queries about sexual health can be made in a way that is comfortable for patients, and questions can be incorporated into routine visits. A useful approach is to screen patients with a few simple questions, either verbally or using a questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98403 \">table 1</a>), and then to refer to a clinician who can focus on sexual health issues. </p><p>When addressing sexual function, it is essential to not make assumptions regarding sexual orientation or sexual practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The patient should be asked open-ended questions that allow her to feel comfortable sharing information that is pertinent to her evaluation and management. For example, vaginal intercourse may not be the most important component of sexual activity for many women, including women who have sex with men or with women. In addition, women who do not currently have a partner should be asked about sexual concerns. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5486472\"><span class=\"h2\">Before treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticipatory guidance regarding sexual health issues is a key element of patient education prior to treatment for cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Many women with sexual adverse effects complain that they wish they would have been informed about the potential effects of oncologic treatment on sexuality. In many cases, these could not be avoided, but they often express a desire to have known what to expect. However, the typical sequence of events that accompanies cancer diagnosis and treatment requires the complete attention of the patient and her medical team, and this often does not allow for addressing posttreatment quality of life issues proactively. Therefore, the appropriate timing of this discussion cannot be easily standardized and will likely vary according to the tumor site, prognosis, and type of treatment. </p><p>One approach that has worked for some oncology teams is to review the typical course of patient care and counseling for a particular tumor site.

Questions can often be incorporated into a routine posttreatment review of systems. In one study of patient follow-up after pelvic radiation, sexual issues were addressed in only 25 percent of visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5486484\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515622846\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sexual history should be taken and the patient should be asked about any history of sexual issues and the diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. A detailed history of the sexual complaint should be taken, including onset in relation to treatment, severity, and whether the issue causes the patient to avoid sexual activity. It is important to assess the aspects of sexual dysfunction that are bothersome to the patient and whether she experiences distress, including symptoms of anxiety or depression associated with these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. </p><p>The interaction between the patient and sexual partners should be discussed, both sexually and in the relationship in general. It may be helpful to discuss whether modifications of sexual practice may help to achieve comfort and pleasure. In addition, the patient should be asked about the sexual function of her partner(s). </p><p>A pertinent medical history, including an oncologic, surgical, obstetric, gynecologic, and sexual history should be taken. The menstrual history should be reviewed to assess menopausal status.</p><p>A medication history should also be reviewed because of its impact on sexual function, including the use of antidepressants and oncologic endocrine therapy or other hormonal medications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515622853\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete pelvic examination should be performed. The evaluation should include a pelvic examination. The vulva and vagina are examined for the presence and severity of atrophy, changes in vaginal length or caliber due to surgery or pelvic radiation, or adhesions. Care should be taken to communicate with the patient regarding her ability to tolerate the exam. For women with genital pain, a narrow Pederson or pediatric speculum may be better tolerated. </p><p>A breast examination should be performed if the sexual complaint involves the breasts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515622860\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing is generally not required, but may be performed if indicated, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic ultrasound may be performed if a mass is palpated on examination or to assess vaginal obstruction (eg, assess whether the vagina is patent above the level of the obstruction). In terms of etiologies of sexual pain, imaging is not helpful in detecting pelvic adhesions. It has a very limited role in detecting endometriosis, which is an etiology of dyspareunia. Endometriosis is stimulated by estrogen, and is unlikely to be symptomatic in menopausal women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum follicle-stimulating hormone or estradiol to assess menopausal status. Menopause is typically diagnosed by the absence of menses for one year, but surgery or endocrine therapy may make menopausal status uncertain. Even with hormonal testing, it may not be possible to determine whether the patient is menopausal, since hormone levels fluctuate. It is also important to determine whether the patient needs contraception. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause#H171787807\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, for example, we check hormone levels if menopausal status is uncertain to assess whether vaginal estrogen is the appropriate therapy for dyspareunia in that patient. Some premenopausal women have transient amenorrhea following treatment and then ovarian function returns.

The overall aim of management is to enable a woman to be comfortable with her sex life. </p><p>The patient should be asked about her goals. The precise objectives may differ to include improving desire, decreased pain with penetration, or achievement of orgasm. Such goals may differ between the patient and her partner, which may require referral for couples therapy or sex therapy. Some patients decline treatment and prefer to stop sexual activity. In addition, not all women have a current sexual partner, and these patients may request treatment to ensure sexual health for the future.</p><p>An important aspect of counseling about treatment is to set appropriate expectations. The clinician should discuss with patients that sexual function and sexual relationships change based on many factors (age, relationship issues, medical factors) and that the outcome may not be exactly the same as before treatment or at a previous time in the patient's sex life. The clinician should also give the patient some sense of the duration of treatment, since some treatments take up to 6 to 12 months (eg, vaginal dilator therapy). </p><p>Cancer survivors should be counseled about contraception and safe sex, as appropriate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5486496\"><span class=\"h2\">Dyspareunia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyspareunia is the most common sexual complaint among female cancer survivors. Dyspareunia is also an important quality of life issue. This was demonstrated most notably among breast cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Dyspareunia may be severe enough to preclude vaginal intercourse. In our experience, if this is the case, the first step toward improvement with treatment is the ability to tolerate insertion of a finger or small dilator. The next step is the ability to tolerate intercourse, but often for a short period of time. Patients should be counseled to communicate with their partner and stop sexual activity if there is severe pain. If treatment is successful, the discomfort gradually decreases and the ability to experience sexual pleasure generally returns.</p><p>The patient should also be counseled about attempting sexual intercourse only when appropriate arousal and lubrication are present. In addition, use of different sexual positions may help to avoid dyspareunia. </p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> is used by many clinicians to treat dyspareunia. We use this only for focal pain of the introitus or a particular point in the vagina that is not responsive to other therapies. It is important to identify the etiology of the pain and treat appropriately. Lidocaine is a primary therapy for some etiologies, including vestibulodynia. A randomized trial of topical lidocaine in breast cancer survivors found that it was effective in women with vestibular pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Vulvovaginal atrophy resulting from hypoestrogenism is the most common etiology of dyspareunia in cancer survivors. Vulvovaginal atrophy is characterized by dryness, thinning of the epithelial lining, and inflammation. This results in a loss of lubrication and elasticity, which along with the thinning of the epithelium, leads to an increase in discomfort or pain either on a daily basis or during vulvovaginal contact. Women with atrophy often develop small lacerations with sexual contact, particularly at the vaginal fourchette where the labia majora converge. This often results in postcoital bleeding, which is self-limited. Both pain and bleeding may result in anxiety about sexual activity. </p><p>The first-line treatment for vaginal atrophy is use of vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. In fact, since dyspareunia is so common, including use of lubricants and moisturizers as part of anticipatory guidance before the symptom develops may help many patients. Moisturizers should be used regularly several times per week, with the goal of ameliorating daily vaginal dryness. Lubricants are intended for use during sexual activity. These products are available over the counter and there are many different brands. Women usually try several products and find the one they prefer. In general, water- or silicone-based products are preferred since they are easier to wash off and do not damage condoms compared with petroleum-based lubricants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Some studies have found that the effect of a vaginal moisturizer is comparable with vaginal estrogen therapy, but many women find vaginal moisturizers and lubricants insufficient, and greater improvement can typically be achieved with vaginal estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of vaginal estrogen therapy in women with estrogen-sensitive cancers is a subject of debate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer#H463691037\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Menopausal symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors#H7205998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of approach to endometrial cancer survivors&quot;, section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-survivors-of-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-or-peritoneal-carcinoma#H891966334\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to survivors of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.) </p><p>Pelvic radiation therapy (RT) also induces ovarian failure in women. Vaginal estrogen therapy may help ameliorate dyspareunia in these patients and improve vaginal elasticity. Some questions have been raised regarding whether vaginal estrogen receptors maintain their function following RT, but studies have shown that local estrogen therapy increases the vaginal maturation index in women who have been treated with pelvic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>For women who decline or are not candidates for vaginal estrogen therapy and for whom vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are insufficient, some additional relief may be obtained with the use of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> oil. These women will likely require vaginal dilator therapy in combination with moisturizers and lubricants. Use of dilators helps to improve vaginal elasticity, and with consistent use, often ameliorates dyspareunia. Patients may be instructed on self-guided use of dilators or may be referred to a pelvic physical therapist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy#H7630851\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;, section on 'Vaginal dilators'</a>.)</p><p>Women with severe dyspareunia, particularly localized to the vaginal vestibule, or pain that is not consistent with atrophy should be evaluated for vulvodynia. Vulvodynia is treated with topical treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-localized-vulvar-pain-syndrome-formerly-vulvodynia-vestibulodynia-vulvar-vestibulitis-or-focal-vulvitis#H3700027140\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of localized vulvar pain syndrome (formerly vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, vulvar vestibulitis, or focal vulvitis)&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, some women develop secondary vaginismus after experiencing painful sexual encounters. Vaginismus is treated with pelvic physical therapy, typically using vaginal dilators and biofeedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of sexual pain in women&quot;, section on 'Vaginismus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5486502\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal stenosis is a severe complication that affects many women who are treated with pelvic RT or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Vaginal obstruction may result in a shortened vagina and may limit or preclude vaginal intercourse, a potentially devastating outcome. </p><p>Pelvic RT is used to treat gynecologic malignancies (endometrial, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer) and anal and colorectal cancers. RT may result in radiation vaginitis or vaginal fibrosis, with possible vaginal shortening or stenosis. The development of radiation fibrosis is the result of damage to the vaginal mucosa and associated blood vessels and connective tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The vaginal tissue eventually reepithelializes, with excess collagen content and smooth muscle fibrosis. The degree of toxicity depends upon the dose, type of radiation, and schedule, as well as factors such as previous surgery, concurrent chemotherapy, and the prior condition of the vagina. The reported incidence of vaginal obstruction following pelvic RT ranges widely from 1.2 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>The natural history of vaginal stenosis associated with RT is not well documented. The process itself does not produce symptoms, and the condition is brought to medical attention when the woman or her sexual partner notes the obstruction or it is found incidentally on examination. The vaginal tissue typically develops a whitened appearance and the vagina loses its elasticity. </p><p>Most radiation oncology teams counsel patients regarding the risks of vaginal fibrosis following pelvic RT and provide instruction on the use of a vaginal dilator. Fibrosis is a late effect of RT, and there is often poor compliance with dilator therapy. The efficacy of vaginal dilator therapy has not been proven, and some authors have raised concerns about whether dilator use increases the risk of lower genital tract fistula. However, there is no alternative to dilator therapy and fistula is a rare complication that is associated with pelvic RT alone, even in the absence of dilator use.</p><p>The management of women with vaginal stenosis resulting from pelvic RT depends upon the degree of obstruction. Some increase in vaginal length or caliber may be gained from vaginal dilator therapy, although in our experience, this is in the range of 1 to 2 cm. Patients often benefit from being referred to a pelvic physical therapist. Women with severe obstruction, who have less than 5 to 6 cm of residual vaginal length, may require counseling regarding modifying their sexual activity to include incomplete vaginal penetration or other sexual activities (eg, using a hand or thighs to augment vaginal length). </p><p>Women who undergo allogeneic HCT may develop vaginal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The reported incidence of vulvovaginal GVHD is 3 percent of bone marrow recipients and 15 percent of peripheral blood recipients, but this condition likely is often undetected since some cases are asymptomatic and patient and clinical awareness is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Partial or complete vaginal obstruction occurs in a minority of patients, but the incidence is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Vulvovaginal GVHD should be suspected in any allogeneic HCT survivor who presents with dyspareunia or a sensation of vaginal obstruction by the patient or her sexual partner. Mild vulvovaginal GVHD is difficult to differentiate from hypoestrogenic atrophy. It is often reasonable to treat initially with a course of vaginal estrogen. Women who do not respond to this therapy likely have GVHD, particularly if the symptoms correspond with the onset or exacerbation of GVHD at other sites (eg, cutaneous, oral). The diagnosis is often made clinically, but a biopsy may be performed. On examination, erythematous areas, ulcerations, or lacerations may be present, particularly in the area of the vaginal fourchette or the labia minora. Vaginal adhesions may be seen, typically in the upper vagina. Obstruction may take the form of an annular ring, sometimes with an aperture through which a swab can be passed. The obstruction and the occluded proximal area of the vagina can be visualized on pelvic ultrasound. </p><p>There is no standard approach to treating vulvovaginal GVHD. Most clinicians treat initially with a topical steroid. If this is not effective, use of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]; vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> has been tolerated in women treated for lichen planus but has not been studied in GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Women with vaginal adhesions may benefit from vaginal dilator therapy or surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515621773\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased libido or arousal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women complain of decreased sexual interest or arousal after cancer treatment. This is likely multifactorial, and the patient should be evaluated and treated based upon the likely etiologies.</p><p>Menopause is associated with decreased libido, but estrogen therapy has not been found to be effective. Testosterone therapy is another option, but testosterone is metabolized to estrogen and is generally given with estrogen, so this is not an option for women in whom systemic estrogen is contraindicated. Testosterone is sometimes administered as a topical therapy to the genital area or other sites; this is absorbed, and should be considered systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-management#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Management&quot;, section on 'Hormone therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Many female cancer survivors are on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, which may decrease libido or interfere with orgasm. The patient should consult with the prescribing clinician to assess whether the medication can be changed or discontinued due to sexual side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a> is an antidepressant that has been found to increase libido in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

Ideally, these professionals can work together to assess the patient's needs, communicate with the oncologist and primary care clinician, and refer the patient to other clinicians as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2515625543\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES</span></p><p>Resources for patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourdiagnosis/afterdiagnosis/after-diagnosis-how-will-cancer-affect-my-sex-life&amp;token=xa+45Ql47NazlrmMKhnI333BNHXYoCgSMmmPsf5/bMPqtkOWpzre6PhMt+IwjZ0MrkxI30aiXXlhYkBO60PyOH9Ah1cdIVLL9zjbu8bwn7y7/F+llvMmcyYVKS8Tv8vc&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Cancer Society</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/facing-forward&amp;token=1ha58UwJ2HnnjxeuEUQdS2uY39qPWveW7qxjiZio87e4Bg+dy188srIbTj0bMtpdST38KjC2Mb1el/HWjT2v/kTb2rxarucPUzrkqsVWCuo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Cancer Institute</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.foundationforwomenscancer.org/&amp;token=rm1mRMOWBJ00XVHU1JhfO54W1YAw+nyyOA4BuuJwcOBErNF48+iN4UKudmJUpwZEY4OTR4nMfT1f+xEhsB19NQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Foundation for Women&rsquo;s Cancer</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.ncsi.org.uk/&amp;token=N12vgbU5X6P4b2S/YzgoE58PMWN7RYL9rx2Xv0Dd6Xg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United Kingdom Cancer Survivorship Initiative</a> </p><p/><p>Examples of sexual health programs for cancer survivors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.dana-farber.org/Adult-Care/Treatment-and-Support/Patient-and-Family-Support/Sexual-Health-Program.aspx&amp;token=JsqyZi8t8diiPQVTXCIs44I4gibBLWGet3uSx4IZLJpngq5wHoJW/qUfdprPU1V8zQUEQtFRbNhPWJRb8PV+mxIEUqpNYm6qjMWFCNxMdnttuPEUSKp93qihe575PnsoKc4x5mFyEQMown/fKxyP3A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Dana Farber Cancer Institute</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.massgeneral.org/cancer/services/treatmentprograms.aspx?id=1744&amp;token=5AFF17yu6jaPOmapNZObdpRzs9xgLSD969NQryNRA4UrkLc5iRXb1/OasB/Ct3eBsxeZilj/PtbEdR6Q68SpCdf39msQQFdsMIF0QJyybaw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/counseling-support/female-sexual-medicine-women-health&amp;token=DS4iKZ0qQcg/Z58OBlm5C99MnJjqYEFIFCpndJFMb7Ddx770nvMm4IYX3Ii3JIiCA4Fz3Bloxcu48zRn0HcVQ7uUXtTETCoB4IERGdrA0WM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.uchospitals.edu/specialties/obgyn/prism.html&amp;token=yMTZONohAwY9Yu1t/M5js1BtknzyTyFKjg++HBttkKXyAqtDLBBX8cHHzzvP4ZA/GgJcyM5YG5qdmTfWdE9T4A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">University of Chicago</a> </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10014157\"><span class=\"h2\">Where to get more information</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=17009\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).

Sexual issues are reported by up to 77 percent of female cancer survivors. (See <a href=\"#H5486454\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2515622803\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Psychiatric Association defines the following female categories for sexual disorders: sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal,</span> orgasmic, and genitopelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/penetration</span>. Each of these categories of function can be impacted by cancer and its treatments. (See <a href=\"#H5486454\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment of cancer may distort anatomy or result in loss of function or sensation related to sexual activity. This is particularly a concern in women with gynecologic or breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1802895\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy can result in systemic effects that decrease both sexual desire and arousal. In addition, chemotherapy may induce ovarian failure with a sudden temporary or permanent loss of estrogen or result in vaginal toxicity. Alopecia may affect a patient's perception of sexual attractiveness. (See <a href=\"#H1802902\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) can also impact sexual function in women. Pelvic RT may result in vaginal fibrosis. RT for breast cancer can result in breast pain, loss of sensation, or changes in appearance. (See <a href=\"#H1802909\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine therapy that induces menopause (eg, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists) or alters estrogen action (selective estrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors) may result in vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. (See <a href=\"#H1803082\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary effects of treatment may also result in sexual dysfunction, including: menopause, graft-versus-host disease, or psychological issues. (See <a href=\"#H1802923\" class=\"local\">'Secondary etiologies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual health issues should be addressed throughout cancer care. This requires screening, counseling, and evaluation and treatment. Initial screening questions should be integrated into treatment and follow-up visits. Patients can then be referred to clinicians who can focus on sexual health issues. (See <a href=\"#H5486466\" class=\"local\">'Screening and counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history should focus on the sexual complaint, sexual history, and oncologic history. A complete pelvic examination should be performed, and a breast examination if the patient has breast complaints associated with sexual function. (See <a href=\"#H5486484\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of treatment is determined by the patient's goals. The overall aim of management is to enable a woman to be comfortable with her sex life. The objectives may differ to include decreasing sexual pain, improving desire, achievement of orgasm, treatment of vaginal obstruction, or addressing psychological issues. (See <a href=\"#H5486490\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sexual-dysfunction-in-female-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Miller KD, Siegel RL, Lin CC, et al.
