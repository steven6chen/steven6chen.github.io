The causes of graft dysfunction in the transplanted heart can be different, more ominous, and in some cases more responsive to treatment than those seen in the native heart. As a result, familiarity with the potential etiologies, coupled with an aggressive and systematic approach, is essential to identify the etiology and begin prompt treatment.</p><p>Graft dysfunction can occur as early as the intraoperative period or can develop many years after transplantation. The timing of graft dysfunction (days, weeks to months, or years post-transplantation) is one of the most important clues to establish a diagnosis. Graft dysfunction may present as either heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction, asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction, or by elevated intracardiac filling pressures or depressed cardiac output on right heart catheterization. It can affect the right, left, or both ventricles. </p><p>The most common causes of graft dysfunction after transplantation include primary graft dysfunction, which typically manifests within 24 hours after surgery; cardiac allograft rejection, which is more common during the first 6 to 12 months post-transplantation; and cardiac allograft vasculopathy, which can occur at any time. Diagnostic procedures such as endomyocardial biopsy, echocardiography, and coronary angiography are important tools in elucidating the etiology, but all these studies have their limitations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endomyocardial-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endomyocardial biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY GRAFT DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early allograft dysfunction can be apparent in the intraoperative period or can develop within 24 hours after transplant surgery. It can manifest as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, isolated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, or biventricular dysfunction, and it is associated with significantly increased 30-day and one-year mortality. Early graft dysfunction is classified as primary or secondary graft dysfunction according to the suspected etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20689079\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary graft dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is currently defined as LV, RV, or biventricular dysfunction that occurs within 24 hours after surgery and is not associated with a discernible cause such as hyperacute rejection, pulmonary hypertension, or uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding resulting in massive blood product transfusions and prolonged graft ischemic time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prior to the development of a standardized definition for PGD, a survey of 47 international heart transplant centers reported an incidence of PGD of 7.4 percent among 9901 patients who underwent heart transplantation between January and March 2013. The majority of centers required an LV ejection fraction of &le;40 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of mechanical support as criteria for PGD. Mortality among patients reported in this survey was 30 percent at 30 days and 35 percent at one year, and the most common causes of 30-day mortality were multiorgan failure in 70 percent of patients, graft failure in 20 percent, and sepsis in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although the etiology of PGD is poorly understood, it is felt that preexisting donor heart disease; injury to the donor heart during brain death; ischemia during the process of organ recovery, preservation, and re-implantation; and reperfusion injury immediately after re-implantation of the allograft and release of the aortic cross-clamp may contribute to the development of PGD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Ischemic and reperfusion injury during surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allograft injury can result from prolonged allograft ischemic time as well as from reperfusion injury immediately following reperfusion of the allograft with the recipient&rsquo;s circulation. Ischemic time refers to the time from cross clamping the donor, with subsequent excision and immersion of the heart in iced saline, to removal of the cross clamp after implantation in the recipient. Advances in organ preservation have permitted longer tolerable ischemic times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, total ischemic time greater than four hours has been associated with an increased risk of PGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and hearts from older donors are more susceptible to ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The injury to the allograft may be transient (myocardial stunning), lasting for 12 to 24 hours after transplantation in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but contraction band necrosis and other evidence of ischemic injury can be seen in biopsy specimens from persistently dysfunctional hearts as well as those with functional recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reperfusion injury of the heart&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Suboptimal donor heart</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pool of potential heart recipients has increased, the donor pool has remained relatively stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As a result, some transplant programs have begun to consider and accept hearts from &quot;suboptimal&quot; donors (eg, patients over age 55 and those with mild LV hypertrophy or non-obstructive coronary artery disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Additionally, some donor hearts have been subjected to higher doses of intravenous inotropes or pressor amines or have evidence of LV dysfunction attributed to the effects of brain death. Hearts from patients with significant LV hypertrophy, valvular heart disease, or obstructive coronary artery disease are still usually avoided, as are hearts damaged from trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100130288\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options for PGD include the use of high-dose inotropic agents to support LV and RV function and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> for RV dysfunction. If medical management does not improve the patient&rsquo;s hemodynamics, then early initiation of mechanical circulatory support with an intraaortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator, or temporary ventricular assist device is recommended before the development of severe end-organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Graft function will recover in many patients after a few weeks, but retransplantation is an option for selected patients with persistent graft dysfunction and reasonable end-organ function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical management of long-term mechanical circulatory support devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20689341\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary graft dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allograft dysfunction can also occur as a result of recipient and procedural factors. Causes include hyperacute rejection and excessive volume or pressure load on the right ventricle. Unrecognized pulmonary hypertension in the recipient can result in RV failure immediately after allograft implantation. Extensive intraoperative bleeding can result in massive blood product transfusion requirements and can subject the vulnerable right ventricle to volume overload and RV dysfunction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20689183\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperacute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperacute rejection, the most ominous cause of perioperative LV dysfunction, is extremely rare and is caused by the presence of pre-formed recipient antibodies that cross-react with endothelial epitopes on the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is most often due to inadvertent implantation of an ABO-mismatched allograft. It may also be seen in highly sensitized patients, such as multiparous women or those with multiple prior transfusions, who have developed pre-formed cytotoxic antibodies that are directed against major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens on the donor heart. This form of rejection occurs within the first 24 hours after transplant and may be evident after reperfusion of the allograft in the operating room. Widespread endothelial damage leads to global ischemia and catastrophic allograft failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100130302\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strategies to avoid secondary graft dysfunction include double-checking ABO blood type matching of donor and recipients, preoperative screening of transplant candidates for the presence of circulating pre-formed antibodies to MHC antigens, the use of virtual or prospective crossmatching of sensitized transplant candidates with potential donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], evaluation of recipients for pulmonary hypertension, and careful post-transplant hemodynamic and volume management. Patients with hyperacute rejection are treated with plasmapheresis in combination with corticosteroids, antilymphocyte antibodies, and intravenous immunoglobulin (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Treatment&quot;</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Eculizumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the compliment protein C5 and inhibits assembly of the membrane attack complex, can be used as salvage treatment in combination with the above therapies, but experience with this drug in heart transplantation is very limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Management of secondary graft dysfunction is otherwise similar to that for PGD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE GRAFT DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular dysfunction that develops weeks to years after transplantation is most often due to allograft rejection or to ischemia caused by allograft coronary artery disease, but may also be due to infectious myocarditis or occasionally may occur without any documentable cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of left, right, or biventricular dysfunction in the weeks to months following cardiac transplantation is most often due to acute allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most cases of acute rejection are diagnosed by routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsy at a time when the patient is asymptomatic and ventricular function is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The symptoms that occur typically represent signs of volume overload or low cardiac output. These include dyspnea on exertion or at rest, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, abdominal bloating, fatigue, and syncope or near-syncope. Other clinical findings that suggest the presence of rejection include new right- or left-sided ventricular gallop sounds on auscultation, elevated jugular venous pressure, or new atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Acute cellular rejection occurs with decreasing frequency and severity over time. Episodes may be associated with weaning of steroid therapy, medication noncompliance, or unrecognized drug interactions that lead to decreased serum concentrations of immunosuppressive drugs. Antibody-mediated rejection is increasingly recognized as a cause of late graft dysfunction and may occur years after transplantation. Risk factors for antibody-mediated rejection include a history of pre-formed antibodies to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) prior to transplant, a positive pretransplant crossmatch, female gender, multiparity, and a history of prior transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of rejection is typically made by endomyocardial biopsy. Asymptomatic rejection is usually detected by routine &quot;protocol&quot; endomyocardial biopsy. The biopsy can also confirm the presence of rejection and identify the type and severity of rejection in patients who develop signs or symptoms of ventricular dysfunction. Noninvasive imaging techniques (eg, echocardiography) may also reveal ventricular dysfunction or evidence of severe diastolic dysfunction but cannot discriminate between graft dysfunction caused by rejection versus other causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Surveillance biopsy schedule'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Histologic findings of acute rejection'</a>.)</p><p>Sampling error associated with endomyocardial biopsy may result in underestimation of the severity of rejection. As a result, the absence of pathologic evidence for severe rejection in the presence of unexplained ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or shock should not deter treatment for rejection.</p><p>The treatment of acute allograft rejection is discussed separately. In severe cases, inotropic agents and temporary mechanical circulatory support may be needed to support the patient while antirejection and heart failure therapies are initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Graft ventricular function often returns to normal with successful treatment of rejection, even if severe. The long-term prognosis can be favorable; however, repeated episodes of severe acute cellular rejection are associated with a greater likelihood of persistent graft dysfunction due to myocardial fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis after cardiac transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19973953\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac allograft vasculopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy or transplant coronary artery disease refers to the development of a diffuse vasculopathy that is limited to the allograft, is related to both immunologic and nonimmunologic factors, and can lead to graft dysfunction months to years after transplantation. Allograft vasculopathy should always be considered as a possible cause for graft dysfunction occurring after the first year post-transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-and-risk-factors-for-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of and risk factors for cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most centers report an angiographic incidence of allograft vasculopathy of 2 to 28 percent at one year after heart transplantation; by five years, the prevalence rises to 40 to 70 percent. The diagnosis is usually made by coronary angiography, but it is generally acknowledged that angiography underestimates this diffuse, concentric process. As a result, many patients who develop clinical events that are presumably due to transplant vasculopathy may not have angiographically significant disease.</p><p>Because of these limitations, adjuncts to angiography have been sought that might improve the detection of transplant vasculopathy. Intravascular ultrasound provides a more quantitative assessment, but it is still mainly used as a research tool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy#H12357202\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features and outcomes of allograft vasculopathy are discussed in detail separately.

Classic anginal chest pain is infrequent due to the presence of both afferent and efferent allograft denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Palliative percutaneous coronary interventions are often performed in patients with discrete lesions amenable to these approaches. Percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with an excellent procedural success rate, but a high incidence of restenosis or new lesion progression is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allograft vasculopathy remains the most common barrier to long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>]. In one report of 54 patients with at least 40 percent stenosis in one or more coronary arteries, overall survival was 67, 44, and 17 percent at one, two, and five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/graft-dysfunction-after-orthotopic-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Hyperacute rejection also can occur during this time period but is now rare. Early allograft dysfunction is treated with high-dose inotropic agents and may require early initiation of mechanical circulatory support (such as the use of an intraaortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator, or a temporary ventricular assist device).
