Classic scabies is typically characterized by an intensely pruritic eruption with small, often excoriated, erythematous papules in sites such as the fingers, wrists, axillae, areolae, waist, genitalia, and buttocks. Crusted scabies, a less common clinical variant, typically presents with scaly, crusted, fissured plaques and primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scabies: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The successful management of scabies involves the eradication of mites from the affected person, management of associated symptoms and complications, assessment for additional individuals who may require treatment, and implementation of measures to minimize transmission and recurrence of infestation. Factors such as the clinical variant, patient characteristics, and the setting of infestation influence the selection of interventions.</p><p>The management of scabies will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of scabies are discussed separately.

Treatment of both the patient and close personal contacts is suggested to prevent recurrent infestation. (See <a href=\"#H139851212\" class=\"local\">'Contacts and environment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1355774792\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic scabies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of antiscabietic agents for classic scabies varies worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a> and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> are the most common first-line treatments in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> is an alternative first-line treatment that may be less effective than permethrin but has the advantage of ease of administration.

Thirty grams is usually sufficient for a single application for an average adult. In young children, scalp involvement is common. Therefore, permethrin should also be applied to the scalp and face (sparing the eyes and mouth) in this population. Permethrin should be removed by washing (shower or bath) after 8 to 14 hours. Treatment is often performed overnight. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A second application one to two weeks later may be necessary to eliminate mites and is typically performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

This mode of treatment may be particularly useful for large scabies outbreaks in nursing homes and other facilities where topical therapy can be impractical. Oral ivermectin is not a recommended first-line treatment for pregnant or lactating women and children who weigh less than 15 kg.

One randomized trial (n = 55) found a higher cure rate at seven days with single-dose ivermectin (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> than placebo (79 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, randomized trials have suggested that a single dose of ivermectin 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> is as or more effective than a single application of 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lindane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lindane</a> but less effective than a single application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> is a newer, albeit high-cost, agent that appears to have efficacy for scabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In an open-label, randomized trial that compared permethrin, topical ivermectin, and oral ivermectin, cure rates for permethrin and topical ivermectin were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Benzyl benzoate (10 or 25%) is commonly used in resource-limited countries because of the drug's low cost. Treatment regimens vary; the drug may be applied once daily at night on two consecutive days, with a repeat treatment cycle after seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Benzyl benzoate is not available in the United States.</p><p>Topical sulfur (6 to 33%) is primarily used for the treatment of neonates and pregnant women.

Lindane should be used only as an alternative therapy in patients who cannot tolerate other therapies or when other therapies have failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A thin layer of lindane 1% (1 oz of lotion or 30 g of cream) is applied to all areas of the body from the neck down and thoroughly washed off after eight hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Participants with scabies received a second dose of the assigned medication after 7 to 14 days. The primary outcome was the change in the prevalence of scabies and impetigo from baseline to 12 months. At 12 months, the prevalence of scabies had declined by 94 percent (95% CI 83-100 percent) in the ivermectin group, 62 percent in the permethrin group (95% CI 49-75 percent), and 49 percent (95% CI 37-60 percent) in the standard-care group. The prevalence of impetigo was reduced by 67, 54, and 32 percent in the three groups, respectively.

Intralesional corticosteroid injections may also be useful for nodules that fail to respond adequately to topical corticosteroid therapy. The injection volume should just make the lesion blanch; typically, 0.1 mL per nodule is adequate. Cutaneous atrophy is a potential side effect of topical intralesional corticosteroid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;, section on 'Side effects, complications, and pitfalls'</a>.)</p><p>Limited data suggest that topical calcineurin inhibitors may be beneficial. Improvement of nodules after treatment with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.03% ointment has been documented in a small case series, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a> appeared effective in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Resolution of nodules following cryotherapy also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Additional studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of these treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H139851212\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTACTS AND ENVIRONMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms of scabies is often delayed for several weeks; therefore, close personal contacts may have active scabies even in the absence of symptoms. As a result, simultaneous treatment of cohabitants and individuals with prolonged physical contact is generally practiced to avoid an endless cycle of transmission and reinfestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, high-quality randomized trials to confirm the efficacy of this practice and to determine the best treatment regimen are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Close personal contacts are typically treated with the same regimens used for classic scabies. (See <a href=\"#H1355774792\" class=\"local\">'Classic scabies'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, environmental measures are suggested with the goal of minimizing risk for transmission or reinfestation. Scabies mites generally do not survive for more than two to three days away from human skin; therefore, such measures are focused on items and areas in contact with the patient over the preceding several days. General environmental measures include laundering or sequestering items that came in close, prolonged contact with the infested individual and adequate cleaning of rooms inhabited by patients with crusted scabies. A more aggressive approach is indicated in institutional settings to minimize risk for transmission to other patients and staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scabies-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Fomite transmission is most likely to occur in the setting of crusted scabies given the associated high mite burden (up to millions of mites). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scabies: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a>.)</p><p>Application of pesticides is <strong>not</strong> indicated in either the home or institutional setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1096368278\"><span class=\"h2\">Community setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat the patient and cohabitants or other individuals who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact in the preceding six weeks simultaneously because symptoms of scabies may be delayed for up to six weeks in newly infested individuals.

We suggest topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a> or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> for first-line treatment of adults (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest treating crusted scabies with a combination of permethrin and ivermectin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1355774792\" class=\"local\">'Classic scabies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3340555677\" class=\"local\">'Crusted scabies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of successful treatment include resolution of active skin lesions and nocturnal pruritus one week after treatment. However, some pruritus often persists for up to four weeks after successful treatment. Examples of causes of pruritus beyond this period include treatment failure, treatment-related skin irritation or contact dermatitis, persistent infestation, or reinfestation. (See <a href=\"#H3485493417\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for cure and treatment failure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1585646803\" class=\"local\">'Pruritus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodules that persist after eradication of mites can be treated with potent topical corticosteroids or intralesional corticosteroid injections.

Thus, individuals who have been in close personal contact with a patient with classic scabies may have active scabies even in the absence of symptoms. We suggest treating patients and individuals who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact with patients with classic scabies simultaneously (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
