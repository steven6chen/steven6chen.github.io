The United States National Institute of Aging described FTT as a &quot;syndrome of weight loss, decreased appetite and poor nutrition, and inactivity, often accompanied by dehydration, depressive symptoms, impaired immune function, and low cholesterol&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. FTT describes the late stages of decline and may represent a final common pathway toward death unless interventions can reverse the course.</p><p>For some patients, FTT is caused by a single disease (eg, cancer) and the treatment of that disease drives the management plan. However, Occam's Razor (the concept that the simplest hypothesis is correct) may not be applicable to FTT. In many cases, multiple factors are present and contribute to impairment: medical comorbidities, medications, and psychological factors may interact. Identifying and treating multiple contributing factors can improve quality of life and function in this group of elders; such treatment should be instituted as appropriate and in keeping with the patient's goals of care. A diagnosis of FTT should be considered as a critical point for the clinician to initiate discussions with patients and caregivers about goals of care; considering aggressive interventions cautiously in the face of declining functional status and worsening prognosis.</p><p>An overview of the management of FTT will be presented here. Evaluation of older patients for suspected FTT and an overview of management of the elder resident in a long-term care facility are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive in elderly adults: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal management of FTT requires a multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach to treat those identifiable causes that are amenable to treatment. Significant improvements in quality of life can be achieved, even in the setting of a major disease state that cannot be cured, by treating contributing factors. As an example, progressive Alzheimer disease cannot be cured. However, simultaneous pharmacologic interventions for depression and memory, elimination of potentially harmful medications, aggressive social work interventions to increase safety and social interaction, and physical therapy to improve gait instability, may halt the downward spiral of FTT for months to years.</p><p>While enlisting the expertise of a multidisciplinary support team (social worker; dietitian; physical, occupational, and speech therapist), the clinician should address the role of medical illness and medications as factors. Oral hygiene should be addressed and referral to dentistry should not be overlooked. Reasonable efforts should be made to uncover new treatable medical problems (ie, reactivation tuberculosis, endocarditis, polymyalgia rheumatica, thyroid disease, or malignancy).</p><p>Management of chronic medical illness should also be optimized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications should be carefully reviewed, and all those not absolutely essential should be discontinued with close observation. Decreasing the dose may be beneficial for necessary medications that have known adverse side effects. Attention to dose adjustments is necessary for patients who develop progressive renal failure or hypoalbuminemia.</p><p>Many medications are considered inappropriate for use in older adults. Medications with anticholinergic properties are best avoided when possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100289 \">table 1</a>). They have been associated with voiding difficulties, cognitive decline, and worse performance on tests of instrumental activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Several criteria sets, including <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.13702/epdf&amp;token=xvm30O72g3bVn6vV/GnkF9JPXsTaNt/t7iU9dZPqFKQCGVReKhUmQClXOBRLV1igyWCvodud997a0InSGLCGJA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3015\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Beers Criteria</a> and ACOVE indicators, have identified potentially inappropriate medications for older individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73834 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WEIGHT LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A key component of failure to thrive (FTT) is weight loss and malnutrition. Special attention should be focused on medication side effects, depression, difficulties with chewing and swallowing, dependency on others for eating, and use of unnecessary dietary restrictions (low <span class=\"nowrap\">salt/low</span> fat) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54156\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54156 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additionally, providing favorite foods, varying texture and flavors, and use of finger foods may improve oral intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional supplements and vitamins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In treatment of weight loss, oral nutritional supplements between meals (low-volume, high caloric drinks or puddings) may be helpful in adding protein and calories. A systematic review found that weight gain was greater for patients treated with nutritional supplements plus dietary advice, compared to dietary advice alone (mean difference weight 1.68 kg, 95% CI 0.14-3.32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A meta-analysis of studies of nutritional supplements showed that providing nutritional supplements to older undernourished adults yielded small gains in weight of 2.2 percent (pooled weighted mean weight gain from 42 trials) and a small mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, this review found no evidence of improvement in function or decrease in hospital length of stay with supplements. An important practical tip is that dietary restrictions should be removed or modified to increase palatability of foods.</p><p>Provision of high protein solid supplements (cookies) was studied in 175 malnourished institutionalized older adults over a six-week period in France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The texture was modified to be suitable for edentulous adults. The intervention group had significant increased weight gain of 1.6 percent of body weight. The subgroup analysis reported increases in appetite and reduction in pressure ulcers as well.</p><p>The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein in the United States is 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> body <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/day</span> for adults regardless of age. This represents the minimum amount of protein required to avoid loss of lean body mass in most people. However, some nutrition experts disagree with the use of this RDA in older adults. The European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS), in cooperation with other scientific organizations, appointed an international study group to review dietary protein needs with aging (PROT-AGE Study Group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The PROT-AGE study group recommends an average daily intake in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 g <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/kg</span> body <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/day</span> and higher intake (1.2 to 1.5 g <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/kg</span> body <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/day)</span> for older adults who have acute or chronic diseases. Older people with severe kidney disease (estimated GFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) should consult with their nephrologist about protein intake levels.</p><p>The PROT-AGE Study Group notes that protein quality, timing of ingestion, and intake of other nutritional supplements may be relevant, but evidence is not yet sufficient to support specific recommendations. In a 10-year longitudinal study of nutritional status and morbidity, women with protein intakes of 1.20 to 1.76 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> tended to have fewer health problems than those with protein intake of less than 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Vitamin supplements are suggested for elders with poor caloric intake; macronutrient deficiencies are common in older patients with weight loss. However, studies in nursing home patients do not show clear evidence of benefit from vitamin supplements if the patient has adequate caloric intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Enteral feeding via feeding tube did not affect survival at 24 months, compared to those hand fed, in nursing home residents over age 65 with severe cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Feeding assistance in nursing home patients may prevent unintentional weight loss. A crossover controlled trial involving 76 nursing home residents at risk for unintentional weight loss found that twice daily feeding assistance (either at meals or snacks) increased caloric intake and maintained or increased weight, while usual care resulted in weight loss over a 24-week period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Assisted feeding at mealtime required 84 minutes of staff time per patient per day, compared with 26 minutes for snack assistance, suggesting the latter approach may be more feasible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Appetite stimulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of appetite stimulants may be considered, although there are few studies of use of these medications in the population with FTT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Megestrol acetate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Megestrol acetate</a>, a progestational agent, has been shown to yield weight gain in patients with anorexia and cachexia.

The consensus panel agreed that four interventions have evidence for the treatment of physical frailty: exercise (resistance and aerobic), caloric and protein support, vitamin D supplementation, and reduction of polypharmacy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A key element of the treatment of physical frailty involves strength and aerobic training. Exercise, known to be important for preventive health benefits, also has been shown to benefit elders who are already frail with multiple comorbidities. Randomized trials in the frailest nursing home patients have shown benefit from resistance exercise, with almost two-fold increase in muscle mass resulting in improved gait speed and exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Participation in moderate to intensive exercise training programs improves functional outcomes and prevents disability in frail older adults in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, exercise attenuated the impact of age on mortality for all levels of frailty or health deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Those exercisers with the highest degree of frailty had the most improvement or stability in health status, compared with those who did little to no exercise.</p><p>Referral to physical therapy for evaluation and treatment is a key step in management. Families should be counseled about the importance of ongoing strength and aerobic training after physical therapy treatment has finished. Caregivers should be encouraged to find ways to continue the recommendations of physical therapy indefinitely.</p><p>In regard to oral nutritional supplements to improve muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">mass/sarcopenia</span> in older adults, there are no clear interventions for patients with sarcopenia in the setting of failure to thrive. However, fish oil supplements were reported as preventive for sarcopenia in a small group of healthy older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A vitamin D and leucine-enriched whey protein nutritional supplement provided twice daily for 13 weeks was studied in 380 independently-living sarcopenic older adults in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There was no difference in the primary outcomes (handgrip strength and Short Performance Physical Battery score) although secondary outcomes (chair stand test and appendicular muscle mass) improved in the intervention group. The authors felt that these results were proof of concept that targeted supplements may benefit sarcopenic elders who are unable to exercise.</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation has been established as an important factor in the care of older adults and is effective for fall prevention and improving balance.

A patient&rsquo;s nutritional status, functional decline, and cognitive impairment may not be amenable to interventions and may not improve depending on the underlying disease state and comorbidities. As FTT in the older adult progresses, it is important to consider a focus on palliative care. FTT and debility were diagnoses previously used for enrollment in hospice; however, in April 2013 CMS indicated that FTT or debility should no longer be used as a primary diagnosis for hospice admission. Debility and FTT are important supporting diagnoses but CMS is encouraging hospices to bill for the primary disease state as the principal diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In addition, each terminal diagnosis typically carries its own list of features or symptoms that are associated with a six-month prognosis or less. Thus, the patient should have a primary diagnosis of a potentially terminal disease state, but the prognosis for any disease state will be worse if the patient meets criteria for clinical decline. Frequently used criteria for determining non-disease specific decline in clinical status that correlate with a six-month prognosis may include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss not due to reversible causes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent or intractable infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent aspiration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate oral intake due to intractable dysphagia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive decline in Karnofsky Performance status </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressing dementia by objective measures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive pressure ulcers (stage 3 or 4) despite optimal care</p><p/><p>Since hospice can provide support and benefits for patients approaching end of life, consultation with a local hospice organization or palliative care specialist may be helpful in determining eligibility and discussing enrollment issues with patients and caregivers.</p><p>Issues related to end-of-life care are discussed separately in multiple topics in UpToDate.

Antidepressants differ in their impact on appetite and weight and, when a trial of antidepressants is initiated, the choice of antidepressant should include consideration of their side effect profile. In addition, we suggest a trial of a low-dose psychostimulant (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> 2.5 mg) for moderately depressed elders with FTT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
