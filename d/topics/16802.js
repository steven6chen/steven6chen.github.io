Blood leaks into the tissues under the skin. Bruises start off red in color, and then turn blue or purple. As they heal, bruises can turn green and yellow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54079 \">figure 1</a>). Most bruises heal in 1 to 2 weeks, but some take longer.</p><p>Bruises can happen when people get hurt, fall, or bump themselves. People usually have pain and swelling in the area of the bruise. Sometimes, the swelling happens right away. Other times, the swelling starts 1 or 2 days later.</p><p>Some people bruise more easily and get worse bruises. These include people who have conditions that keep the blood from clotting normally and people who take medicines to prevent blood clots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9403428\"><span class=\"h1\">How are bruises treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bruise will get better on its own.

Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the area, if possible &ndash; Raising the area above the level of your heart helps to reduce swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to reduce the pain and swelling &ndash; To treat pain, you can take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol).
