Normal motor function requires the coordination of neurologic, physiologic, and biologic processes including proprioception, vestibular integration, strength, balance, coordination, dexterity, visual-motor ability, and visual ability. Individual and environmental factors, such as motivation, perseverance, opportunity for practice, and encouragement, also play a role. Problems in any of these areas can result in lack of motor skills, or clumsiness.</p><p>Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is characterized by problems with motor coordination that interfere with academic performance and social integration in otherwise healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These motor problems typically present in the early school years with difficulty performing simple motor tasks (eg, running, buttoning, or using scissors) and usually persist into adolescence and adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>The management and outcome of DCD will be discussed in this topic review. The clinical features and diagnosis of DCD are discussed separately.

All children with DCD should receive supportive care and treatment (or referral for treatment) for associated conditions if they are present.

Qualitative research suggests that parents are more troubled by the social difficulties that result from their child's motor incoordination than the motor incoordination itself and that cognitive and behavioral strategies are beneficial in helping children with DCD adapt to their motor difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7496985\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7498518\"><span class=\"h3\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care includes education of the child, parents, and teachers.

The clinician's acknowledgment of recognition that the child has been teased or ostracized for his or her incoordination can be of therapeutic benefit to the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], particularly if he or she has been described as &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;sloppy&quot; by teachers or parents.</p><p>The child's self-esteem can be increased by encouraging the child to participate in activities in which he or she can achieve success (eg, swimming or horseback riding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Modifications of expectations (eg, less emphasis on competitive sports) or the environment (eg, self-gripping fasteners rather than buttons or ties) can also be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Parents can help educate teachers, coaches, and the parents of their child's friends to consider ways to minimize the impact of the child's DCD on his or her ability to participate in age-appropriate activities so as to diminish the effect of DCD on normal socialization.

However, the sport, level of competition, and child and coach characteristics must be factored into the decision. Participation in team sports may be a practical means of decreasing isolation when the child-team-parent fit is right. It is important for the coach to have an understanding of children with diverse skills. Sports in which the child participates as an individual on a team (eg, swimming, track and field, tennis, martial arts, bowling) may be better than those that require coordination of the child&rsquo;s actions with those of teammates (eg, soccer). Noncompetitive or intramural teams may be better than more competitive travel teams. Limited research suggests Taekwondo training as a means of improving strength and balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1319227257\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor and social skills training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with DCD may benefit from organized programs to improve motor and social skills.</p><p>As an example, the &quot;Animal Fun&quot; program, which is delivered by teachers, is designed to promote motor and social skills through the imitation of animal movements and behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Although it may not produce sustained improvement in general motor skills, it can help to improve particular motor skills, educate parents, and address issues of self-esteem in the child. There is little information to guide recommendations for frequency or duration of services. These decisions are best made on a case-by-case basis, tailored to individual goals and response to treatment (based on levels of activities and participation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>We suggest task-oriented or traditional occupational <span class=\"nowrap\">therapy/physical</span> therapy approaches rather than process-oriented approaches, dietary supplements, or pharmacologic therapies.

Meta-analysis of two randomized and four quasi-randomized trials suggested improvement in motor performance, but when only the randomized trials were included, task-oriented intervention had no effect. The systematic review found no evidence related to the relative effects of task-oriented compared with other types of interventions. Earlier systematic reviews found that task-oriented and traditional motor-training therapies had greater effects on motor performance than process-oriented approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/8,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30</a>].

Although inability to ride a bike does not impact school performance specifically, it may significantly limit socialization in some communities. Parents can be encouraged to seek specific therapy to acquire bike skills in middle childhood to avoid social isolation. Such therapy may be provided through school-based or community-based occupational therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7497009\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatty acid supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not suggest dietary supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for DCD. Evidence is insufficient that it improves motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The effects of dietary supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on the motor skills, reading and spelling achievement, and ADHD-related symptoms were evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 117 children (aged 5 to 12 years) with DCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The groups were treated in parallel for three months, after which all subjects received active treatment for an additional three months. No effects on motor skills were apparent. However, reading, spelling, and behavior were improved among the children who received supplementation compared with controls. After the crossover, improvements in these areas were also noted among the controls, and progress in the treatment group was maintained or improved. The mechanism for these effects is unclear. The findings suggest that fatty acid supplementation may be a safe and effective treatment for improving the behavior and academic skills of children with DCD but do not affect motor skills. Further research is necessary to determine whether the nonmotor effects of dietary supplementation are maintained for longer periods of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7497015\"><span class=\"h2\">ADHD pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic therapy (stimulant or nonstimulant) for ADHD is not indicated for children with DCD who do not have coexisting ADHD.
