Measurements of ionized calcium and total calcium are closely related, but the relationship may vary in settings of abnormal albumin concentrations, pH extremes, and during blood transfusions. As an example, each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> reduction in the serum albumin concentration will lower the total calcium concentration by approximately 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> without affecting the ionized calcium concentration.

PTH is released from the parathyroid chief cells. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) resides on the plasma membrane of the chief cells and serves as a &quot;calcistat,&quot; which continuously senses ambient ionized calcium concentration. Acute changes in ionized calcium levels are immediately detected by the CaSR, which effects a rapid increase or decrease in PTH secretion based on the direction of change in ionized calcium. This classic negative endocrine feedback loop allows for an increase in PTH as ionized calcium concentration decreases, engaging mechanisms to increase the ionized calcium level. As ionized calcium levels rise, there is suppression of PTH secretion to maintain the steady state narrow range of ionized calcium levels. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PTH acts to increase serum calcium by:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mobilizing calcium from the bone &ndash; via stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption and release of calcium from a rapidly exchangeable calcium pool. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stimulating 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidney &ndash; thereby converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the active form of vitamin D), which directly increases intestinal calcium absorption. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Directly increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal renal tubule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin D</strong> &mdash; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, promotes calcium and phosphorus absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Lesser effects on calcium reabsorption from the renal tubules may also occur. Exposure to pharmacologic amounts of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may also affect bone resorption, with net movement of calcium into the blood.</p><p/><p>The hormone calcitonin<strong> </strong>plays a less critical role in calcium homeostasis. Calcitonin is synthesized in and released from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland when the circulating concentration of ionized calcium is increased. Calcitonin acts by decreasing bone resorption by osteoclasts.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of calcium homeostasis is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-calcium-and-phosphate-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of calcium and phosphate balance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid hormone secretion and action&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary determinant of symptoms and signs in patients with hypocalcemia is the circulating ionized calcium concentration. A low ionized calcium concentration results from either decreased entry of calcium into the circulation (gastrointestinal malabsorption, decreased bone reabsorption, eg, due to hypoparathyroidism or hypovitaminosis D) or increased loss of ionized calcium from the circulation (deposition in tissue, loss in urine, or increased binding of calcium in serum) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53781 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute hypocalcemia is generally caused by rapid movement of calcium from the circulation to other tissue compartments or by formation of complexes of the calcium ion with phosphate, other counterions, or protein binding. For example, phosphate administration may lower serum ionized calcium concentrations by promoting formation of calcium-phosphate complexes, and precipitation of mineral in soft tissue or bone matrix. Alkalosis decreases the concentration of serum ionized calcium by increasing the binding of ionized calcium to albumin. Ingestion of ammonium bifluoride (an ingredient of glass-etching creams) can form calcium complexes and thereby acutely lower circulating ionized calcium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] </p><p>Chronic or subacute hypocalcemia mainly results from long-term dysfunction of the primary organs mediating calcium movement (intestine, bone, and kidney) or defects in the calcium homeostatic system. In some cases, the hypocalcemia is caused by primary disturbances of these organs such as short gut (resulting in inadequate calcium absorption) or osteopetrosis (resulting in failure to mobilize calcium from bone). In the absence of such a defect, disturbances in the hormonal control of calcium homeostasis, such as hypoparathyroidism or vitamin D deficiency, may cause chronic hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Normal calcium homeostasis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL HYPOCALCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypocalcemia is common in the newborn period and often transient, particularly in infants who are sick or have low birth weights. Persistent hypocalcemia may also present during the neonatal period, and will be defined with time of follow-up such that therapy directed to the specific etiology can be provided. This disorder is discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266913718\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient neonatal hypocalcemia can be divided into early and late forms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early transient</strong> &mdash; Early transient neonatal hypocalcemia is defined as occurring within 72 hours of life. Contributing factors for transient early hypocalcemia often represent the effects of a variety of insults interrupting parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or action. Such factors include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maternal factors &ndash; These include maternal vitamin D deficiency, use of anticonvulsants, diabetes (either permanent or gestational), hyperparathyroidism, and toxemia of pregnancy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neonatal factors &ndash; These include prematurity, low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, and birth asphyxia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Concurrent illness &ndash; Other illnesses commonly seen in the neonate such as sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hyperbilirubinemia including phototherapy, and renal failure can contribute to hypocalcemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exogenous or iatrogenic factors &ndash; The administration of excess phosphate, lipid infusions, citrated blood, and bicarbonate can cause a decrease in circulating ionized calcium concentrations. Inadequate calcium in parenteral nutrition solutions may also contribute to this problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late transient</strong> &mdash; Late transient neonatal hypocalcemia develops after 72 hours of life and has been attributed to the relatively large phosphate load occurring with cow's milk and cow's milk formulas. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Encouraging breastfeeding or the use of a low phosphate formula such as Similac PM <span class=\"nowrap\">60/40</span> is useful.

The hypoparathyroidism may present with hypocalcemia during the neonatal period, or it may occur later in life, in the setting of increased demands for PTH with diminished parathyroid reserve. DiGeorge syndrome is a result of abnormal development of the third and fourth branchial pouches. Other features include thymic aplasia or hypoplasia, cardiac defect affecting the outflow tract, developmental delay, and a characteristic facial appearance (prominent nose, squared nasal root).

The activating mutation causes hypocalcemia by shifting the set point of CaSR, such that PTH is not released at serum calcium concentrations that normally trigger PTH release. Renal calcium reabsorption in these patients is also lower than anticipated because of the absence of PTH secretion. ADH 2 (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/615361&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWCWwkWWopUbIUvQO12t6U91USTLuzG5OCniFYJZ36Upk&amp;TOPIC_ID=5846\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #615361</a>) is caused by activating mutations in <em>GNA11</em> (guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha 11 gene), a GTPase which mediates downstream CaSR signaling.

However, during periods of stress such as a febrile illness, patients can become symptomatic with seizures, and neuromuscular irritability (tetany). It is the authors' experience that some of these patients escape detection by being mislabeled as children with febrile seizures, hence the importance of screening serum calcium in any child presenting with seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ADH is uncommon in the general population, but it is often confused with the diagnosis of isolated primary hypoparathyroidism.
