For the majority of patients with HCM, LVH is not progressive, and HCM is compatible with normal longevity in the vast majority with a low annual mortality rate among non-referral based cohorts. A small subset of patients, however, remains at risk for a number of adverse disease-related complications, including sudden death, usually in the absence of symptoms; progressive HF symptoms occasionally associated with systolic dysfunction; and atrial fibrillation (AF) with risk of thromboembolic stroke.</p><p>Patients with HCM are prone to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Many of these arrhythmias are asymptomatic, but some can precipitate hemodynamic collapse, embolic stroke, and sudden cardiac death. Thus, the evaluation of arrhythmias and their clinical consequences is one of the primary aims of management in patients with HCM.</p><p>The evaluation and management of supraventricular tachycardias, primarily AF, in patients with HCM will be reviewed here.

Eighteen of the 21 patients developed asymptomatic AF episodes (ie, clinically silent), most of which lasted less than one hour; however, 13 of the 18 patients with clinically silent AF had more than one episode, and 8 of the 18 ultimately developed symptoms attributed to AF. Given the relatively small number of patients in this study, the thromboembolic risk due to silent AF in HCM is not well defined, but expert opinion supports a low threshold for thromboembolic prophylaxis in this situation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266008473\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AF and other atrial arrhythmias can be problematic in patients with HCM for multiple reasons. HCM is associated with a thick and non-compliant left ventricle (LV) resulting in some degree of diastolic dysfunction in nearly all patients. For this reason, patients with HCM are particularly dependent on normal atrial kick to provide optimal LV filling and cardiac output. AF, with loss of atrial kick and associated rapid ventricular rates, results in reduces diastolic filling time and a reduction in LV filling, all of which contributes to increased heart failure symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, the presence and degree of diastolic dysfunction have a significant impact on a patient's ability to tolerate AF and other atrial tachyarrhythmias.

However, patients with HCM, especially those with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction or those with severe diastolic dysfunction, are at risk for hypotension, lightheadedness, presyncope, and syncope. This risk is related to decreased LV diastolic filling time during the tachycardia, which may also provoke or worsen an LVOT gradient. As an example, in a series of 52 patients with HCM who developed AF, the acute onset of AF was associated with worsening of symptoms in 89 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-pathophysiology-and-management-of-concurrent-atrial-arrhythmias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In this clinical scenario, expert opinion has generally supported rate control for AF in patients with HCM who are asymptomatic.

While data are limited, for maintenance of sinus rhythm in most patients with HCM and AF, our experts generally use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> as first-line antiarrhythmic therapy. Sotalol should be started on an inpatient basis, regardless of whether the patient has an ICD or not, monitoring over several doses for clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval or proarrhythmia. As an alternative initial therapeutic option, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a> may be used but is considered less effective in suppressing AF than sotalol, and due to the possibility that disopyramide may accelerate atrioventricular (AV) conduction, it must be given in combination with an AV nodal blocking agent, such as a beta blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-pathophysiology-and-management-of-concurrent-atrial-arrhythmias/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. In addition, the use of disopyramide should be confined to patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (where it has been demonstrated to be safe), as its use in nonobstructive patients can increase filling pressures and may cause heart failure symptoms.

For patients in whom a rate control strategy is selected, we recommend the use of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or the two drugs in combination, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>. </p><p>For the majority of patients with HCM, onset of AF results in an acute development of limiting symptoms (or worsening of existing symptoms), which often substantially impacts the patient's quality of life. For this reason, the goal is often maintenance of sinus rhythm, as restoration of atrial contribution to stroke volume is so important. However, in the minority of patients with HCM and AF who are asymptomatic, a rate control strategy can be considered initially or in those patients who have failed efforts at rhythm control and who are not candidates for an ablation procedure. </p><p>Ventricular rate control can be achieved with pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic means. Beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>), or the two drugs in combination are usually adequate to control the ventricular rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-pathophysiology-and-management-of-concurrent-atrial-arrhythmias/abstract/13,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16-18</a>].

However, since AF in patients with HCM carries a significant risk of thromboembolism and often recurs, patients with even isolated short episodes of AF should be treated with chronic oral anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> to a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-pathophysiology-and-management-of-concurrent-atrial-arrhythmias/abstract/2,13,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,16,18</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H266008303\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several factors predispose to the development of AF in patients with HCM, including left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, left atrial diameter and volume, increasing age, and heart failure symptoms. In contrast to these risk factors, the presence or severity of an LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient does not appear to be associated with an increased incidence of AF. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While most patients with HCM who develop AF have fairly prominent symptoms, not all patients will be symptomatic. The acute symptoms associated with AF in patients with HCM, which may include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest pain, are similar to the symptoms of AF in patients without HCM. However, patients with HCM, especially those with an LVOT gradient, are also at risk for hypotension, lightheadedness, presyncope, and syncope. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term consequences of both paroxysmal and <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/permanent</span> AF in patients with HCM include an increase in limiting symptoms and risk of thromboembolic stroke, as well as decreased overall functional status.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AF is usually suspected in a patient with palpitations, dyspnea, or chest pain with an irregularly irregular pulse present on physical examination and confirmed by obtaining an electrocardiogram (ECG).
