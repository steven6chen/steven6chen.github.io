It is also possible to get infected if blood or fluids with HIV get into your eyes or mouth, but this is less risky. It is very unlikely that you would get HIV just by getting blood or other body fluids on your skin.</p><p>Body fluids that are most dangerous include blood and the fluids that come from the penis, vagina, and anus during sex. Other body fluids are less dangerous, as long as they aren't mixed with blood. This includes urine, saliva, sweat, and tears.</p><p>Human bites are unusual, but HIV can be passed from one person to another if one of them is infected, and the bite breaks the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97468122\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I lower my chances of getting HIV even after being exposed to the virus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, yes. There are treatments that can reduce your risk of getting HIV. Doctors call this &quot;post-exposure prophylaxis,&quot; or &quot;PEP.&quot; But for it to reduce your risk, you must start the treatment within 3 days of being exposed to the virus.</p><p>If you think you have been exposed to HIV, see your doctor or nurse right away. If an unusual event happened, like a condom broke, or you had unprotected sex, or you were raped, taking medicines after the event might help you.</p><p>You should keep in mind that the risk of getting HIV after one exposure is usually pretty low. Still, it is always best to discuss your risk of HIV with your doctor or nurse. He or she can give you the best advice after an exposure. Don't try to figure out your risk of HIV on your own.</p><p>You should also keep in mind that medicines to prevent HIV after exposure are not for people who risk getting exposed over and over again. In other words, if you commonly have unprotected sex or share needles when you use drugs, these treatments are not for you. Instead, you might be able to take HIV medicines every day to reduce the risk of getting HIV. Doctors call this &quot;pre-exposure prophylaxis,&quot; or &quot;PrEP.&quot; If you do this, it is very important to always remember to take the medicines and visit your doctor regularly. Ask your doctor if this type of treatment is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97468129\"><span class=\"h1\">How likely is it that I will get HIV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on a lot of things, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How you were exposed &ndash; Some ways of getting exposed are riskier than others. For example, although it is possible to get HIV through oral sex, it is unusual. On the other hand, sharing needles if you use drugs is extremely risky. Also, anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have any sores or cuts on the part of your body that was exposed &ndash; People who have open wounds or sores are more likely to get infected. For example, if you have herpes sores on your genitals, your risk of getting HIV goes up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the body fluids you were exposed to came from a person who is taking HIV medicines &ndash; If the person has HIV but is being treated, and their medicines are working, your risk will be very low. If the person has HIV and has a lot of virus in his or her blood, your risk of getting HIV goes up.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97468136\"><span class=\"h1\">What will the doctor or nurse do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, your doctor or nurse will probably test you for HIV. This will tell him or her whether you were already infected with the virus in the past. (It takes a couple of weeks for the virus to show up in your blood and the test to turn positive.) If you already have HIV, it is important for you to see a doctor so you can get started on the right medicines. </p><p>If the test is negative, you and your doctor or nurse will have to decide if HIV medicines are right for you based on how likely it is that you could become infected, and on how you feel about the risks and benefits of taking medicines.</p><p>If the two of you decide that you should take medicines to prevent HIV infection, your doctor or nurse will usually prescribe 3 different medicines. You will need to start these as soon as possible and take them for a month.</p><p>If the person who exposed you is willing to be tested, your doctor or nurse might test him or her also. If they can test the person right away, and the test is negative, then you won't have to take HIV medicines. However, sometimes this is not possible. If you already started the medicines, you can stop them if you find out later that the person who exposed you does not have HIV.</p><p>Your doctor might also test or treat you for other types of infections you can get through sex or by sharing needles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97468143\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the risks or side effects of medicines to prevent HIV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The side effects differ depending on which specific medicines you take. In general, most patients don't have problems while taking these medicines. If you do have side effects, they might include nausea or vomiting or a rash. You should call your doctor or nurse if this happens.</p><p>If you are pregnant or could be pregnant, tell your doctor or nurse. Some medicines are not safe to use in pregnant women, so your doctor or nurse needs to know if you are or could be pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97468150\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after I am done taking the medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will test you again to see if you got infected with HIV. These tests will be done 2 or 3 times after your exposure, depending on which test they use.</p><p>It is very important that you take all the medicine your doctor prescribes. Still, even if you take all your medicine correctly, there is no guarantee that you will not get infected. The medicines improve your chances, but they do not always prevent HIV. That is why it is best not to share needles or have unprotected sex in the first place.</p><p>In the weeks after your exposure, look for symptoms of HIV infection, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen glands </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sores in your mouth, penis, anus, or vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle and joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>These symptoms usually happen 2 to 4 weeks after you might have been exposed. If you notice any symptoms that worry you, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97468157\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Until you know for sure whether you have HIV, make sure to use condoms during sex. Or avoid sex. Do not donate blood, sperm, or any tissues. Otherwise, if it turns out you did get HIV, you could infect someone else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97468270\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-treatment-for-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Starting treatment for HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-monitor-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tests to monitor HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-or-body-fluid-exposure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood or body fluid exposure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-rape-or-sexual-assault-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Care after rape or sexual assault (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-of-hiv-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Symptoms of HIV infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Initial treatment of HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
