In most patients, we start with atorvastatin for reasons of cost. For patients with prior intolerance to atorvastatin, baseline elevation in liver transaminase levels, those who are taking medications that might interact with atorvastatin but not rosuvastatin, or those for whom a greater lowering of LDL-C is needed, rosuvastatin is used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We start therapy as soon as possible after the diagnosis. If the LDL-C remains above 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> on a low fat diet (and a hypocaloric diet for overweight patients) and high-intensity statin, we add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> 10 mg daily. For occasional patients who still have a persistently elevated LDL-C despite high-dose statin and ezetimibe, one should consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor.

Thus, statins are the preferred LDL-C lowering agents as they are more potent than other approved medical therapies. In addition, there is evidence that some of the clinical benefit from statin therapy may involve mechanisms (referred to as pleiotropic effects), other than LDL-C lowering, that can be important early after an ACS, including plaque stabilization, reversal of endothelial dysfunction, decreased thrombogenicity, and reduced inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-lowering-after-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

From 2011 to 2014, there was a progressive increase in high-intensity statin therapy after a myocardial infarction in Medicare beneficiaries and patients with commercial insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-lowering-after-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

We typically use atorvastatin 80 mg daily, as it is the best studied statin in this setting. However, it is uncertain whether the benefits seen in early therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg in patients with ACS represent a class effect of high-intensity statin therapy or are specific to atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin 40 or 20 mg lowers LDL-C to a comparable or greater degree than atorvastatin 80 mg and we consider it a reasonable alternative, particularly in those with prior intolerance to atorvastatin, those who are taking medications that might interact with atorvastatin but not rosuvastatin, or those for whom greater lowering of LDL-C is needed. </p><p>The randomized trials presented below suggest that the intensity of statin therapy (the degree of LDL-C lowering), rather than the agent used, is the principal determinant of clinical outcomes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial</strong> &minus; The efficacy of this approach was best evaluated in the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial, which randomly assigned 4162 patients with an ACS (35 percent ST elevation MI [myocardial infarction], 36 percent non-ST elevation MI, and 29 percent unstable angina) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-lowering-after-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In addition, the patient populations were different, as 79 percent of patients were from the United States in PROVE IT-TIMI 22 compared to 21 percent in Phase Z. This may be an important feature since both trials found substantial (18 to 33 percent) and equivalent risk reductions in the United States patients and small (6 to 8 percent), nonsignificant risk reductions in patients outside the United States. This difference may in part reflect the much higher rate of PCI in the United States in the two trials (79 versus 34 to 44 percent in other countries).

For those individuals who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy and who have not lowered their LDL-C below 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we add ezetimibe 10 mg daily in most cases, as was done in IMPROVE-IT (see <a href=\"#H270297754\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above). Some experts do not add ezetimibe to statin but rather add PCSK9 inhibitor to statin.

The two broad approaches include lowering the LDL-C to a prespecified level (&quot;LDL goal&quot;) or treating with the drugs (and doses) found to be effective in clinical trials (&ldquo;medication choice&rdquo;). Evidence from randomized trials is used to support both approaches. If the first approach is chosen, an LDL-C goal is set and lipid-lowering therapy is intensified until either the goal is reached or side effects prevent further intensification. With the latter approach, the drug intervention is chosen and the LDL-C goal is less important. In many cases, these two strategies will lead to the same clinical recommendation. These two approaches are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Most relevant randomized trials using statin therapy did not compare one LDL-C goal to another, but rather a more intensive therapy to a less intense one. For example, IMPROVE-IT compared the statin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> to statin alone. One trial actually did compare titration to different goals: the ALLIANCE &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; trial compared a strategy of titrating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> dose to aim for LDL &lt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> with a standard-of-care approach. The trial did demonstrate a benefit of titrating to goal strategy (HR = 0.83, p = 0.02) showing benefit of the titration approach. However, in all studies, lower LDL-C levels at the end of the studies, including those as low as 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> were associated with better outcomes than higher LDL-C levels. As discussed above, the PROVE IT-TIMI 22, MIRACL, and A to Z trials showed that high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> 40 followed by 80 mg) leads to better outcomes than lower-dose statin or placebo. &#160;</p><p>Our recommendation to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> to intensive statin therapy for any patient with an LDL-C &ge;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is based on the IMPROVE-IT trial (see <a href=\"#H270297754\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above), in which combination therapy lowered the average LDL-C to 53 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> from 69 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (in the statin only group). This lowering was associated with improved clinical outcomes. Similarly, our practice to attempt to lower the LDL-C to approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is based on this result in IMPROVE-IT.

A 2015 meta-analysis of 24 randomized trials that enrolled predominantly stable patients (N = 10,159) found that PCSK9-ab reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.86), cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.23-1.10), and MI (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-lowering-after-an-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, while the individual trials established the efficacy at LDL-C lowering and short- and mid-term safety of these agents, they were not powered to detect significant differences in clinically important cardiovascular outcomes such as mortality.
