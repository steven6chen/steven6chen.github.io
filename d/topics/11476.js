Although abnormalities of nails can be disfiguring, it is usually pain that brings the patient to the clinician. Most asymptomatic nail disorders affect the toenails, but the fingernails can be affected as well. A variety of relatively simple approaches to nail problems can prevent or alleviate symptoms, and others may correct or cure the underlying problem.</p><p>Nail anatomy and common office procedures performed on the nails are described here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-and-overview-of-nail-surgery#H120459084\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles and overview of nail surgery&quot;, section on 'Surgical anatomy of the nail unit'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PARING, TRIMMING, AND GRINDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toenail paring, trimming, and grinding are commonly performed by clinicians and podiatrists on patients with diabetes or those who have physical limitations that affect their ability to perform routine nail care. Paring and trimming can be performed with regular nail clippers, but heavy-duty English anvil nail nippers are recommended because the slow-growing nails of older patients result in a very thick, tough nail plate, which requires the spring-handled device for satisfactory trimming (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86021\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86021 \">picture 2A</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the years, a variety of techniques, including cutting the distal nail square, angling the edges, or creating a &quot;V&quot; in the center, have been advocated. After trying many techniques, the author prefers to customize the shape of the nail trim to its problems, most often shaping the distal edge to the toe shape. The nails are trimmed to leave 2 to 3 mm of free nail plate, then an emery board is used to file down sharp edges that may accidentally catch on stockings and lift the nail plate from the bed.</p><p>An ingrown portion of a nail plate deeply embedded into the lateral soft tissue can be removed by placing the tip of the nipper under the &quot;ingrown&quot; edge and cutting it free. This simple procedure can temporarily provide pain relief for several weeks.</p><p>Sometimes nails are too thick and too dystrophic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76809\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76809 \">picture 3</a>) for nippers alone; in this case, nail grinders are essential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86022 \">picture 2B</a>). Grinders are drills with specially designed bits that grind and sand down the hyperkeratotic material. Grinding and sanding can eliminate a considerable amount of thick keratin, which often substantially reduces pain by removing the hard, inflexible keratin driving into the underlying soft tissue.</p><p>Eye protection and a surgical mask or plastic face shield covering the entire face are advised when paring and grinding nails; bits of nail may fly off when cut, and the powdery nail, often infected with fungal elements, is aerosolized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific care advised after simple trimming, paring, or grinding, although applying a cream or lotion containing 20 to 25% topical urea daily to the nail plate helps prevent excessive thickening. If, while removing an imbedded portion of nail, the skin is broken by the nail, a topical antibiotic covered with an adhesive bandage and washing of the site daily are appropriate until there is complete healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NAIL AVULSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nail avulsion is a procedure whereby all or a portion of the nail plate is removed from the nail bed. Avulsions are done for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Avulsing the nail plate allows for examination and visualization of lesions in the underlying nail bed and matrix. Most frequently, nail avulsion is done for ingrown and incurved nails. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ingrown-toenails\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ingrown toenails&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nail avulsions are sometimes performed when treating onychomycosis because some clinicians believe that topical application of antifungal agents along with systemic therapy enhances therapeutic response, although good supportive data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-management#H782570468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Management&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Sometimes nails are avulsed traumatically. When there is partial traumatic avulsion, the nail can be trimmed short and covered with an adhesive bandage to prevent &quot;catching&quot; and further traumatic avulsion. An effort should be made to maintain as much of the remaining adherent nail plate as possible so as to prevent further damage to, and keratinization of, the nail bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nail avulsion is extremely painful and requires adequate anesthesia for optimal results. The patient should be in a recumbent position. Anesthesia is provided by a digital block or wing block, supplemented with local injections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While waiting for the anesthesia to take effect, the digit can be soaked in an antiseptic bath (povidone-iodine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>). Before starting the procedure, the adequacy of anesthesia should be tested by inserting a needle into the digital tip and under the nail.</p><p>To begin, the operator holds the digit to keep it stable during the procedure. A blunt instrument, such as a narrow dental spatula, a thin, small elevator (Freer septum elevator) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86023 \">picture 4</a>), or a straight mosquito hemostat, is then placed under the distal edge of the plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86024\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86024 \">picture 5</a>). Advance the instrument longitudinally toward the matrix in the natural cleavage plane, stopping in the area of the proximal nail groove (the tissue forming the proximal wall of the nail matrix). Some force is initially required to advance the instrument, but then it becomes relatively easy to advance until the proximal nail groove is reached. When performing a complete avulsion, the maneuver is repeated under a new section of nail plate, and the instrument is also moved in a side-to-side fashion, until the entire plate is freed from underlying nail bed and adjacent nail folds. The same instrument is then placed on top of the nail plate under the lateral and proximal nail folds to break these attachments. The free distal edge of the nail is then grasped with a hemostat and pulled out with a side-to-side or twisting motion. Any strands of epithelium can be snipped with small scissors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>With partial avulsions, the instrument is advanced as before under the nail plate longitudinally until the nail groove is reached; however, the separation of the nail plate from the nail bed is confined to the width of the plate that needs to be removed. After this is accomplished, the surface nail attachments at the lateral fold are lysed as before. A nail splitter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86025 \">picture 6</a>) is placed under the plate, advanced the entire length of the plate, then closed to cut the nail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77818 \">picture 7</a>). The free edge of the avulsed portion of nail is then grasped with a hemostat and pulled out.</p><p>Having removed the nail, a thin film of petrolatum or antimicrobial ointment is placed on the exposed nail bed and then is covered with a small nonadherent dressing. The entire digit is then wrapped securely, but not too tightly, with 1- or 2-inch rolled gauze. Bleeding is usually minimal if only avulsion is performed.</p><p>When operating on the toenail, advise the patient to bring an open-toed shoe or slipper to wear home after the procedure.</p><p>Elevation of the extremity for two to three postoperative hours minimizes discomfort as the anesthetic wears off. The pain following simple avulsion is variable; swelling, pre-existing inflammation, and tight dressings are contributing factors. Intermittent elevation of the extremity over the next 48 to 72 hours can help reduce swelling and pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After simple avulsion, the digit should be soaked in warm water 24 to 48 hours after the procedure. Before removal of the dressing, patients are instructed to soak their digit in the shower or in a bowl to avoid bleeding and pain when the dressing is removed. A gelatinous film of epithelium may be present over the exposed nail bed and can be gently removed with dilute hydrogen peroxide on a cotton-tipped applicator. The cotton tip should be rolled over the site gently, avoiding rubbing or vigorous attempts at tissue removal. A small amount of petrolatum or antibiotic ointment is placed on the tissue, then it is covered with an adhesive bandage for a simple avulsion or roller gauze if a matricectomy was performed. This dressing change should be repeated daily.</p><p>The nail bed typically epithelializes within 7 to 10 days. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMICAL MATRICECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical matricectomy is the chemical ablation of all or part of the nail matrix. The rationale for chemical matricectomy is to destroy the matrix to prevent the nail from growing. Typical indications are recurrent or chronically ingrown or incurved nails with frequent pain or infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ingrown-toenails\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ingrown toenails&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chemical ablation has several advantages over surgical matricectomy: It is relatively easy to perform, causes minimal bleeding, allows the patient to return to normal activities after a few days, and is not significantly disfiguring.</p><p>Data on recurrence rates after chemical matricectomy derived from observational studies vary from less than 5 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. A 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis including 24 randomized trials (2826 patients) evaluating interventions for ingrown toenails concluded that nail avulsion combined with phenol destruction of the nail matrix leads to a 75 to 91 percent reduction in the recurrence of ingrowing toenails compared with excisional techniques alone, although there is a higher rate of postoperative secondary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The procedure below describes the use of phenol in performing the chemical matricectomy. Studies have described more rapid healing and low recurrence rates with the use of sodium hydroxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], or bichloracetic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but until additional studies are performed demonstrating efficacy, safety, and ease of use, we continue to use phenol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplies needed for chemical matricectomy include a preoperative antiseptic solution, anesthesia supplies, sterile drapes, sterile gloves, elevating instrument (dental spatula, Freer elevator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86023 \">picture 4</a>), straight mosquito forceps), nail splitter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86025 \">picture 6</a>) (for partial matricectomy), scissors, forceps, small curette (an ear curette or other 1- to 2-mm curette), tourniquet, cotton-tipped applicators, petroleum jelly, fully saturated (88 percent) liquefied phenol, isopropyl alcohol in 20-mL syringes, petrolatum or antibiotic ointment, nonadherent gauze, and roller gauze. An electrocautery device is optional, as are a long-acting anesthesia (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>) and a corticosteroid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) for injection.</p><p>To perform the procedure, the digit must be well anesthetized with a digital block and soaked in the antiseptic solution (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;</a>). Place the patient in a recumbent position on the operating table, and apply sterile drapes to expose the operative site. The nail plate is partially avulsed if just a portion of the matrix is to be ablated or completely avulsed if the entire matrix is to be ablated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nail avulsion'</a> above.)</p><p>Any exuberant tissue (ie, granulation tissue) should be curetted or excised with scissors and forceps. Granulation tissue is a highly vascular tissue reaction to the ingrowing nail acting as a foreign body. Once this tissue is removed, bleeding usually subsides. The area of matrix to be treated is then curetted sharply. Electrocautery may be performed on this area of the matrix to control bleeding using a thin, fine tip to avoid damage to the overlying proximal nail fold tissue. A tourniquet is then placed at the base of the digit to prevent blood from diluting the phenol. The overlying proximal nail fold, adjacent nail bed, and lateral nail folds are then coated with petroleum jelly to prevent phenol from damaging these tissues.</p><p>Cotton-tipped applicators are stripped of all but a small wisp of cotton, or, alternatively, the bare end of the stick is covered with a small wisp of cotton, which is then saturated with phenol solution. The cotton wisp should be held against the inside mouth of the phenol bottle to drain the excess phenol to prevent dripping. The phenol-soaked wisp is then applied to the matrix and vigorously rubbed into the treatment area for 30 seconds. One to two subsequent phenol applications are made in a similar fashion. The tissue will denature quickly and turn white or gray. The denaturation by phenol is self-limiting, and no irrigation is necessary; however, some surgeons irrigate the treated area with 30 to 50 mL of isopropyl alcohol or water. The tourniquet is then removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The tourniquet should never be left in place for longer than 10 to 15 minutes.</p><p>After completing a chemical ablation, many clinicians inject either a long-acting anesthetic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>) or a combination of 0.6 mL of long-acting anesthetic and 0.4 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> into the proximal nail fold (total volume of injection is approximately 0.5 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The anesthetic provides an extended period of comfort, allowing the patient to get any needed prescription medication, get home, and elevate the treated foot or hand. The author has found that patients require less pain medication, few, if any, opioids, and are able to walk comfortably more quickly when using this technique. Some surgeons find the addition of steroids to be helpful in preventing postoperative chemical lymphangitis, which can sometimes occur.</p><p>Petrolatum or an antibiotic ointment is placed on the nail bed, the site is covered with a nonadherent dressing, and then the entire digit is wrapped with 1- or 2-inch roller gauze. The wrapping should be secure but not so tight as to be uncomfortable. Dressings wrapped too tightly may increase postoperative pain.</p><p>The patient is then advised to go home and elevate the affected foot or hand for 24 to 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wound care for chemical matricectomy is the same as that for simple avulsion (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Wound care'</a> above). Patients should be advised that a serous discharge from the wound may occur in the first few days and up to two weeks postoperatively.</p><p>After a partial matricectomy, the affected nail bed begins to keratinize or harden, producing a &quot;pseudonail,&quot; and the lateral nail fold epithelium grows toward the remaining nail plate, eventually producing a normal-appearing nail, albeit slightly narrower. With complete matricectomy, the nail bed keratinizes and forms a pseudonail that appears similar to a nail plate. Gauze coverings should be used postmatricectomy for one week, then adhesive bandages should be used for an additional two to three weeks.</p><p>Occasionally, chemical matricectomy does not completely prevent nail plate regrowth. If a portion of the nail or the entire nail regrows, the procedure can be repeated. Occasionally, a narrow spicule of nail regrows and can be removed using a hemostat. If recurrent and symptomatic, treating the matrix in the area of spicule growth using electrocautery or chemical cauterization can be done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614002454\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is the most common complication following nail surgery. Most pain occurs in the first 24 to 48 hours, and the majority of patients can return to normal activities while wearing an open-toed shoe after 48 hours. Pain control measures include elevation of the affected limb, use of ice packs, and oral analgesics. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate elevation requires that the limb be held above the level of the heart. Elevation should be continued for 24 to 48 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice packs applied to the dorsal foot in the case of toenails or dorsal hand or wrist for fingernails may diminish pain and slow the clearing of anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral analgesics, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and oral opioids, can be used in combination with elevation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Oral analgesics'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Persistent or worsening pain 48 hours after the procedure indicates an infection or chemical cellulitis. Patients should be instructed to contact the clinician in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain worsens rather than improves over 24 hours.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is increasing redness of the area.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A red streak develops.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pus is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is fever.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1197048350\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before surgery. Local inflammation, tissue swelling and bleeding, and drainage around the nail are due to the nail embedded in the adjacent soft tissue. Like other foreign body reactions, removing the embedded nail resolves the problem.</p><p>Secondary infection is more likely to occur when infection is present before the procedure. Thus, permanent procedures should be avoided in the presence of infection, and infection should be treated prior to operating whenever possible.</p><p>If secondary infection is suspected, a culture from the wound should be obtained. Since in the first few postoperative days bacterial infections are in most cases caused by <em>Staphylococcus</em> <em>aureus</em>, empiric therapy for methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em> should be initiated pending the culture and sensitivity results. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cephalexin</a> is a common option for oral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H569543049\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemical cellulitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chemical cellulitis can occur secondary to the denaturing of tissue by phenol. Although some degree of chemical cellulitis occurs in many cases, it usually is not enough to warrant a visit to the clinician. Severe chemical cellulitis is recognized when the swelling not only involves the digit, but the entire foot or hand, or extends proximal to the foot or hand. Associated erythema and pain are variable. Most cases can be managed with continued elevation of the foot or hand to above the level of the heart, alternating cold and warm compresses, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diminished vascular supply to the digit is a relative but not absolute contraindication to nail surgery. It is common for patients with significant peripheral vascular disease, including diabetes, to have painful disorders of the nail, and surgical intervention may be indicated. Avoiding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in the anesthetic, using digital rather than local blocks, minimizing or eliminating a tourniquet, and using palliative rather than permanent procedures help reduce risk in these patients.</p><p>Overt bacterial infection of the operative site is a relative contraindication to chemical matricectomy, and temporizing procedures often need to be performed. Patients with acute infection at the operative site should be treated with a systemic antibiotic for two to three weeks prior to surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57923056\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail disorders, particularly ingrown, incurved, pincer, hypertrophic, infected, and painful nails, are common conditions in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60056%7EDERM%2F59295%7EDERM%2F67968\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60056 graphicRef59295 graphicRef67968 \">picture 1A-C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H3614002454\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1197048350\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail surgery may be contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease and reduced vascular supply to the digits. When surgery is necessary, avoiding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in the anesthetic, using digital rather than local blocks, minimizing or eliminating a tourniquet, and using palliative rather than permanent procedures help reduce risk in these patients.
