People who have the disease get sick if they eat bread, pasta, pizza, and cereal. These foods and others contain a protein called &quot;gluten.&quot; Gluten damages the intestines of people with celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, their bodies can't absorb nutrients from food. The disease affects children and adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458422892\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of celiac disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with celiac disease have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel movements that are oily and float</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling bloated, or too full all the time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad gas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itchy skin rashes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invisible symptoms, such as weak bones or low iron levels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow growth in children</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458422899\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think you have celiac disease, see a doctor <strong>before</strong> cutting out gluten from your diet. It's the only way to make sure you get the right kind of help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458422906\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take my child to the doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child should see the doctor if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has diarrhea that lasts for weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has constipation that won't go away</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has brown or yellow teeth with pits or grooves in them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is too small or light for his or her age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is close to becoming a teenager but does not seem to be going through the changes that teenagers go through (doctors call this &quot;delayed puberty&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has other family members with the disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458422913\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for celiac disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors use more than one test to diagnose celiac disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood test</strong> &ndash; A blood test looks for proteins that some people make after eating gluten. People who have celiac disease have lots of these proteins, called antibodies. You should ideally be on a gluten-containing diet for several weeks before getting the blood test. If you are on a gluten-free diet, your doctor might do other blood tests to see if you are genetically likely to have celiac disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biopsy</strong> &ndash; To do a biopsy, the doctor will put a thin tube with a tiny camera down your throat. When the tube is in your small intestine, he or she will take a small sample of tissue. That way he or she can look at the tissue under a microscope and see if eating gluten has damaged the intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458422920\"><span class=\"h1\">How is celiac disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best treatment is to stop eating gluten completely. This might be hard to do at first. You will need to avoid rye, wheat, barley, and maybe oats. These ingredients appear in many common foods, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bread, pasta, pastries, and cereal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many sauces, spreads, and condiments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beers, ales, lagers, and malt vinegars</p><p/><p>You should also avoid milk, cheese, and other dairy foods at first. These foods can be hard to break down. You will want to wait to eat these foods until after your intestines have a chance to heal.</p><p>Foods that do not contain gluten (and are fine to eat) include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rice, corn, potatoes, buckwheat, and soybeans</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruits and vegetables</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flours, pasta, and other products made from these ingredients that have a label on them that says &quot;gluten free&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wine and distilled alcoholic drinks, such as rum, tequila, vodka, and whiskey</p><p/><p>Your doctor might also prescribe vitamins to make up for nutrients that you have not been getting from food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458422927\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People usually feel a lot better within 2 weeks of starting a gluten-free diet. Still, most people need to make huge changes in their lives to avoid gluten.</p><p>See a health expert to learn how to change your eating habits and still be healthy. Learn how to read and understand labels on foods. You will probably need to avoid gluten for the rest of your life.</p><p>The hardest part about the disease is learning to eat in a whole new way. The good news: There are plenty of foods made just for people with celiac disease. The new diet just takes a little getting used to.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458422934\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gluten-free-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gluten-free diet (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Celiac disease in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celiac-disease-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Celiac disease in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
