ICAM-1 may exist in either a membrane bound form (mICAM-1) or a soluble form (sICAM-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>ICAM-1 is usually expressed on non-ciliated epithelial cells of the adenoid and nasopharyngeal mucosa (18); in addition, ICAM-1 is present on endothelial cells, in the germinal center, and on the basal surface of the ciliated epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. ICAM-1 is not normally present on the luminal surface of nasal epithelium, as demonstrated in studies utilizing immunohistochemical techniques in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>].</p><p>In vitro study of bronchial epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus has shown that ICAM-1 expression is upregulated following rhinovirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].

IL-8 is locally produced and rapidly increases in nasal secretions following rhinovirus challenge. Nasal challenge with IL-8 results in a significant influx of PMNs within hours and in increased nasal resistance within 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], suggesting that IL-8 must also act directly at the cellular level.</p><p>It is postulated that oxidative stress resulting from rhinoviral infection activates cellular mechanisms that lead to the production and release of IL-8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. IL-8 has been shown to cause up-regulation of adhesion molecule receptors on neutrophils and can cause neutrophil degranulation in addition to chemotaxis of eosinophils, T lymphocytes, and basophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, cytokine elaboration, especially IL-8, plays an important role in the influx of PMN's into nasal secretions and development of symptoms in rhinoviral infection.</p><p>Local production is further supported by the in vivo observation that IL-8 mRNA was significantly increased in nasal epithelium of symptomatic children during viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Studies of volunteers inoculated with rhinovirus also demonstrated that symptoms during infection correlated with an increase in the concentration of IL-8 in nasal secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of kinins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kinins are produced on-site in nasal mucosa and submucosa of rhinovirus-infected volunteers.

In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of rhinovirus in bronchial biopsy specimens from 5 of 10 volunteers who were inoculated with rhinovirus type 16 by intranasal aerosol insufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Hybridization signal was localized to the epithelium, with occasional detection in the basal and subepithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, rhinovirus may infect the lower respiratory tract during the course of a typical rhinoviral cold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRAL REPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhinovirus remains detectable by culture in the nasopharynx for two weeks following inoculation during experimental rhinovirus infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Viral detection is terminated between two and three weeks, coincident with appearance of serum neutralizing antibody. In contrast, symptoms usually diminish by five to seven days, before virus has cleared.</p><p>A plausible explanation for the discrepancy between early symptom abatement and later viral clearance is that the inflammatory response induced by infection of nasal epithelial cells is successful in reducing the elaboration of pro-inflammatory signals by infected epithelial cells in the nose. Infected cells undergo apoptosis and are extruded from the nasal mucosa, limiting spread of virus to neighboring cells. The extruded cells are swept posteriorly by the combination of plasma exudation and increased glandular secretion. Symptoms diminish as the number of infected epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa declines. Apoptotic infected cells may then be swallowed after transport to the nasopharynx.</p><p>It is important to further evaluate this hypothesis since it may have a direct bearing on effective therapies for rhinovirus infections. If this hypothesis is correct, effective dampening of the inflammatory response in the nose may result in increased viral replication in the nasal mucosa and, perhaps, prolongation of symptomatic illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ILLNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhinovirus infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic with the usual signs and symptoms of the common cold. Asymptomatic infections occur most commonly in older children and adults. As an example, in a study evaluating rhinovirus transmission within families, most infections (21 of 23) in young children were symptomatic, whereas approximately half of infections (19 of 38) in older children and adults were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This difference may be due to acquired immunity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differences in virus types and host factors. It is also possible that young children have an increased number of ICAM-1 receptors, resulting in more symptomatic infection, as has been shown in adults with asthma. </p><p>When symptomatic infection does occur, the clinical manifestations can vary depending upon the age of the patient. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults typically present with nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a sore or scratchy throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Fever is not usually associated with adult illness. Symptoms typically resolve in five to seven days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children have cough and nasal discharge and obstruction more frequently than adults. In addition, they may initially have fever. The duration of signs and symptoms are also longer for children, with 70 percent of children still reporting clinical manifestations by day 10 as compared with only about 20 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>Rhinoviruses may also contribute to community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Surveillance studies that evaluated 2259 adults and 2222 children with CAP found that rhinovirus was one of the most common pathogens detected in respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Early apoptosis is regulated by Type 1 interferon; elaboration of interferon-beta is markedly deficient in primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects when the cells are infected with rhinovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Treatment of cells from asthmatics with interferon-beta restored apoptosis to rhinovirus infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. These studies suggest that abnormalities in the cellular response to viral infection that result in impaired apoptosis and increased viral replication may be responsible for the severe and prolonged symptoms typical of asthmatic individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
