Several nonoral routes of insulin administration other than subcutaneous and intravenous routes have been studied, including transdermal, buccal, nasal, and pulmonary delivery. Among these, the lung provides an attractive option for insulin therapy, given its accessibility and large alveolar-capillary network for drug absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The experience with Exubera represented a major setback for the field, with most pharmaceutical companies reevaluating and canceling their <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inhaled insulin</a> research and development programs.</p><p>In June 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inhaled insulin</a> (Afrezza [human insulin] inhalation powder) to cover prandial insulin requirements in nonsmoking adults with diabetes who are free of pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The new drug-device combination product, which became available for clinical use in the United States in February 2015, consists of a dry powder formulation of recombinant regular human insulin (Technosphere insulin [TI]), packaged in prefilled cartridges and delivered through a hand-held, pocket-sized, breath-powered inhalation device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622708796\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For insulin to be delivered through the lungs, inhalation devices that provide dose accuracy and consistency are critical. The first <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inhaled insulin</a> delivery system (Exubera) involved use of a bulky device to dispense insulin with a complicated dosing scheme.

After inhalation and upon contact with the lung surface, Technosphere particles carrying <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> molecules dissolve rapidly at physiologic pH, and both excipient and insulin are rapidly absorbed in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. TI is nearly completely cleared from the lungs compared with the Exubera formulation (0.3 versus 9 percent remaining in the lungs 12 hours after TI versus Exubera administration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Due to decreased bioavailability (approximately 25 percent that of subcutaneous insulin), more insulin must be administered through inhalation than by subcutaneous injection to achieve an equivalent therapeutic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622708802\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following inhalation of TI in healthy, nonsmoking adults, blood insulin concentration peaks faster than with subcutaneous insulin, at approximately 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,18</a>].

In addition, the degree of glycemic improvement with TI (absolute mean A1C decrease of approximately 0.55 percent from baseline) and proportion achieving desired goals (approximately 19 percent) were much lower compared with historical trials with subcutaneous insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>The modest absolute glycemic efficacy of TI may be due to suboptimal treatment employed in the premarketing clinical trials and raises the question of whether therapy with subcutaneous insulin was applied appropriately in the comparator arm and truly represented &quot;standard of therapy,&quot; or whether the comparison was between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inhaled insulin</a> and substandard subcutaneous insulin therapy. Indeed, with a few exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>], structured insulin titration regimens to reach prespecified glycemic goals were either lacking or were not enforced in the trials with TI, which may have resulted in inadequate optimization of both TI and reference treatment, including background therapy (eg, basal insulin). Had the insulin regimens been adequately titrated, it is possible that there may have been larger differences favoring subcutaneous insulin.</p><p>Another explanation for the modest efficacy of TI might be a &quot;ceiling&quot; effect. In contrast with subcutaneous insulin, TI exhibits a dose-response relationship where increasing doses do not result in proportional glucose-lowering effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28</a>], suggesting a plateau effect for TI. Finally, because of dosing inflexibility relative to subcutaneous insulin, it may be difficult to achieve narrow glucose goals with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-insulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inhaled insulin</a> preparations (see <a href=\"#H622708959\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> below). Therefore, having patients replace their current, effective subcutaneous therapy with inhaled insulin may not result in the same degree of glycemic control.
