The anatomy of the glands and ducts affects where stones are likely to lodge and also affects the choice of therapies. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parotid glands and Stensen's</strong> <strong>duct</strong> &ndash; The parotid glands are located on the sides of the face anterior to the external auditory canal, superior to the angle of the mandible, and inferior to the zygomatic arch. Most of the parotid gland is superficial to the masseter muscle. Stensen's duct arises from the anterior border of the parotid gland and is 4 to 7 cm long and 2 to 3 mm in diameter, narrowing to 1.2 mm at an isthmus. The os of Stensen&rsquo;s gland is 0.5 mm in diameter and is opposite the upper second molar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Submandibular glands and Wharton's duct</strong> &ndash; The submandibular glands lie beneath the floor of the mouth. Wharton's duct arises from the medial surface and is approximately 5 cm long and 1.5 mm in diameter. The os of Wharton&rsquo;s duct is 0.5 mm diameter and located on the floor of the mouth near the frenulum of the tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sublingual glands</strong> &ndash; The sublingual glands are located below the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. They are drained by multiple small ducts that empty either into Wharton's duct or directly into the floor of the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minor salivary glands</strong> &ndash; The minor salivary glands are exocrine tissue located in the buccal, labial, lingual, and palatal mucosa that drain directly into the mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1298809452\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of stone formation is not known, but relative stagnation of salivary flow and salivary calcium concentration are thought to be important. Salivary stones are composed largely of calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite with smaller amounts of magnesium, potassium, and ammonium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Inflammation of the salivary gland or duct and localized injury often contribute. The submandibular gland may be more prone to stone formation because the duct is long, the flow of saliva is slow and against gravity, and the saliva is more alkaline with a high mucin and calcium content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a 1 percent incidence is noted in autopsy studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], clinically symptomatic stones are much less frequently noted. A population-based study in England found a lifetime prevalence of symptomatic sialolithiasis of 0.45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Men develop more stones than women, and the majority of cases occur in individuals between the ages of 30 and 60 years. Stones rarely occur in children.</p><p>Seventy-five percent of salivary stones are single and approximately 3 percent are bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Submandibular stones tend to be larger than stones in other glands and are most often located in the duct. Parotid stones tend to be smaller than submandibular stones, are more often multiple, and 50 percent of the time are located within the gland itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2604907112\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sialolithiasis typically presents with pain and swelling in the involved gland; these symptoms are usually aggravated by eating or by anticipation of eating. Stones can also present as painless swelling or may be noted incidentally on physical examination or on radiographs (such as dental radiographs). Approximately 33 percent of patients with submandibular sialolithiasis present with painless swelling and 10 percent with pain but not swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Patients may have episodic swelling and discomfort or may have more persistent symptoms. A stone that causes intermittent obstruction may cause symptomatic episodes separated by days to weeks.</p><p>Worsening pain, erythema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever may indicate secondary infection.

Palpate the course of Wharton's duct along the floor of the mouth in a posterior to anterior direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>). A stone may be felt within Wharton's duct or seen at its orifice near the frenulum of the tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71787 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Parotid gland</strong> &ndash; Palpate the buccal mucosa around the opening of Stensen's duct, which is adjacent to the second upper molar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>). Also palpate the face along the duct's route by starting at the attachment of the earlobe and palpating forward in the direction of the jaw-line with one hand on the outside and one hand inside the mouth.

They are palpable in the parenchyma of the gland.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2147004922\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary infection</strong> &ndash; Sialolithiasis can lead to secondary infection as a result of ductal obstruction and salivary stasis; this is a particular problem in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While these infections are often minor and respond rapidly to antibiotics, a small number progress to extensive cellulitis and abscess formation with the potential to compromise the airway. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Primary care management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic sialadenitis</strong> &ndash; Recurrent episodes of sialolithiasis may result in chronic sialadenitis and dysfunction. Chronic submandibular sialadenitis can result in a significant drop salivary flow, since the submandibular glands contribute 70 percent of the oral salivary flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The drop in salivary flow rarely has any clinical consequences. Most salivary gland function recovers if the obstruction is relieved and the gland and duct remain intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, once a gland has atrophied from chronic obstruction, function is not regained.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2035159033\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3795837993\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sialolithiasis is a clinical diagnosis based on a characteristic history and physical examination. There is typically sudden onset of swelling and pain in the affected gland associated with eating or anticipation of eating. A stone may be seen at the opening of the affected salivary gland duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71787 \">picture 1</a>) or palpated along the course of the duct. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3827756637\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging can provide details about the location of a stone and can be helpful if the diagnosis is unclear or if there is concern about a salivary gland tumor. Imaging can also be helpful when a complication, such as an abscess, is suspected. Solid lesions are concerning for salivary gland neoplasm, both benign and malignant, or lymphoma. Cystic lesions are more consistent with benign causes such as lymphoepithelial cysts, commonly seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and Warthin tumor (a rare benign salivary gland tumor). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-tumors-epidemiology-diagnosis-evaluation-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland tumors: Epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are a number of available imaging modalities, each with advantages and disadvantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography</strong> &ndash; High-resolution noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scanning is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of salivary stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most stones contain enough calcium to be visible with noncontrast imaging. Fine cuts must be requested so that the stone or stones are not missed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CT scans have a high sensitivity for salivary stone detection; a retrospective cohort study reported a sensitivity of 98 percent and a specificity of 88 percent using sialoendoscopy as the reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Excellent assessment of the entire gland is available and sensitivity for the identification of parotid tumors approaches 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound can be used to diagnose salivary gland stones. More than 90 percent of stones 2 mm in diameter or larger can be detected by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Advantages of ultrasound include its noninvasive nature, relatively low cost, and lack of radiation exposure. Disadvantages include the need for an experienced operator and low sensitivity for detecting salivary gland neoplasms or stone related complications, such as strictures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance</strong> <strong>sialography </strong>&ndash; Magnetic resonance sialography is a noninvasive alternative to conventional sialography. It does not require intraductal contrast. Studies of magnetic resonance sialography suggest that it may have superior sensitivity compared with ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and a lower procedural failure rate than conventional sialography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not visualize stones well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], so it is not an appropriate choice for evaluation of possible salivary gland stones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional sialography</strong> &ndash; Conventional sialography for the diagnosis of sialolithiasis has been largely supplanted by high-resolution CT scanning or ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In conventional sialography, the duct is cannulated and a radiopaque dye is injected, followed by plain films. Sialography is contraindicated in patients with acute sialadenitis or contrast allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other disease processes may affect the salivary glands and must be distinguished from sialolithiasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115832 \">table 1</a>).

It is the most common cause of parotid gland swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Infection is frequently accompanied by a nonspecific prodrome consisting of low-grade fever, malaise, headache, myalgias, and anorexia. These symptoms are generally followed within 48 hours by the development of parotitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mumps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mumps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other less common viral etiologies of sialadenitis include coxsackie viruses A and B, echovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A, and Epstein-Barr virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute bacterial sialadenitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute bacterial sialadenitis (suppurative sialadenitis) in the absence of sialolithiasis typically affects older adults, and malnourished or postoperative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The parotid gland is most commonly involved. Acute bacterial sialadenitis is characterized by sudden onset of very firm and tender swelling over the involved gland. Purulent drainage can often be expressed from the affected duct orifice. Fever and chills are usually present, generally with fairly marked systemic toxicity.</p><p><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the most frequent microbiologic isolate, but <em>Streptococcus pneumonia</em>, <em>Streptococcus viridans</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Bacteroides</em> species have also been isolated. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be initiated. Prompt surgical drainage and decompression is required if an abscess develops.

Occasionally, open surgical extraction of the stone is necessary (eg, proximal stones, larger stones). In rare cases, it may be necessary to excise the affected salivary gland (sialoadenectomy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3790913409\"><span class=\"h3\">Sialoendoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For salivary stones that do not resolve with conservative management, minimally-invasive approaches are highly successful. In particular, sialoendoscopy is widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Operative sialoendoscopes have a working channel through which miniaturized tools can be introduced. These include wire baskets and forceps for extracting stones and micro drills and laser fibers for fragmenting larger stones. Sialoendoscopy can be carried out with local or general anesthesia. In a systematic review, the overall success rate of sialoendoscopy (for a variety of indications, including obstructive stones, stenosis, and sialadenitis) was 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Good prognostic factors for successful removal of salivary stones via sialoendoscopy include small size, mobility, roundness, and distal location in the main salivary duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Size is the most important predictor of success; stones less than 3 mm in the parotid and 4 mm in the submandibular gland are easily removed without fragmentation, while removal of larger stones is technically more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, an open intraoral approach assisted by sialoendoscopy allows retrieval of proximal stones larger than 10 mm in over 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Sialoendoscopy may be utilized to visualize the ductal anatomy as well as to remove small stones that are beyond the reach of traditional transoral surgical procedures. Sialoendoscopy may also be used diagnostically, to detect small stones not detected by imaging, and to differentiate a stone from a polyp or mucous plug.</p><p>Sialoendoscopy may be used after traditional transoral calculus removal to check for the presence of residual stone fragments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3572061740\"><span class=\"h3\">Other minimally invasive techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of other minimally invasive interventions depends on the specific practice setting.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extracorporeal lithotripsy</strong> &ndash; For patients in whom a simple transoral surgical approach is not possible (typically stones in the proximal ducts or in the salivary glands themselves) or fails, extracorporeal lithotripsy appears to be effective for stones that are intraductal and less than 7 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, extracorporeal lithotripsy for salivary stones is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laser lithotripsy</strong> &ndash; Laser lithotripsy (available in some locations in the United States) is an alternative to extracorporeal lithotripsy and can be performed via endoscopy (see <a href=\"#H3790913409\" class=\"local\">'Sialoendoscopy'</a> above).

Stones that are palpable within the mouth are generally amenable to this procedure. Transoral submandibular stone removal may be complicated by trauma to the duct and associated sublingual glands, which can lead to formation of a retention cyst on the floor of the mouth (ie, ranula).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Proximal stones are more challenging to remove transorally, although technically achievable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The increased dissection required through a limited exposure may lead to a greater risk of trauma to surrounding nerves. Multiple procedures may be required when the initial attempt is unsuccessful. Growing experience with combining sialoendoscopic and open intraoral techniques has led to improved success rates in removing proximal stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salivary-gland-stones/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transcervical excision of the submandibular gland (sialoadenectomy) is typically reserved for cases where transoral or minimally invasive approaches have been unsuccessful or for a patient who would not tolerate a potential second procedure.
