The pharmacology and use of these drugs will be discussed here. Other oral hypoglycemic drugs are reviewed separately.

Taken orally, they inhibit the upper gastrointestinal enzymes (alpha-glucosidases) that convert complex polysaccharide carbohydrates into monosaccharides in a dose-dependent fashion. These drugs slow absorption of glucose; the slower rise in postprandial blood glucose concentrations is potentially beneficial in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In older patients with type 2 diabetes, acarbose may also increase insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acarbose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acarbose</a> and voglibose have also been evaluated for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

In one trial, 96 patients who were inadequately controlled by diet alone were randomly assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glyburide</a> or acarbose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The A1C values and fasting blood glucose concentrations fell by a similar amount in both groups; postprandial blood glucose concentrations, however, remained high in the glyburide group but fell in the acarbose group. A second trial evaluated 354 patients treated with diet alone or diet plus a sulfonylurea, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, or insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As compared with placebo, the addition of acarbose in each of these groups reduced the mean postprandial blood glucose concentration by 63 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and lowered A1C values by 0.4 to 0.9 percentage points; furthermore, more than 50 percent of patients responded to acarbose. In general, acarbose has resulted in greater improvement in A1C values than in fasting blood glucose concentrations, consistent with its predominant effect on postprandial hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miglitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Miglitol</a> has similar efficacy, based upon studies in which it was given alone or combined with insulin or a sulfonylurea, as compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. There are no studies that compare miglitol with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acarbose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acarbose</a>, but they appear to have comparable effects. Miglitol is also effective when combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 41 trials of alpha-glucosidase inhibitor therapy (primarily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acarbose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acarbose</a> trials), beneficial effects were seen (compared with placebo) on A1C (-0.77 percentage points), fasting and postload glucose, and postload insulin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on serum lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on serum lipids are conflicting. As an example, in a study of 96 patients with type 2 diabetes, those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acarbose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acarbose</a>, 100 mg three times daily, for 24 weeks had a 27 percent decrease in the ratio of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, due to both a decrease in serum LDL cholesterol concentrations (158 to 123 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.1 to 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> and an increase in serum HDL cholesterol concentrations (55 to 64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.4 to 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In this trial, 1429 patients with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned to acarbose (100 mg three times daily or placebo for a mean of 3.3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. An a priori secondary objective of the study, designed to evaluate the incidence of diabetes, was to evaluate the development of major cardiovascular events or hypertension. Acarbose therapy significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 49 percent when compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.95; absolute risk reduction of 2.5 percent). This was an unanticipated finding. The major reduction was in myocardial infarction risk (HR 0.09). In addition, the risk of developing hypertension was decreased by 34 percent (HR 0.66, absolute risk reduction of 5.3 percent). Decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. These findings are hypothesis generating and need to be confirmed by further trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main side effects of these drugs are flatulence (which affected 73 percent of patients versus 39 percent in the placebo group in one of the above studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-and-lipase-inhibitors-for-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) and diarrhea.
