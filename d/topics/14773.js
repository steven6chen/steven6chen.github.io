As many as 80 percent of patients with solid tumors will develop painful bone metastases to the spine, pelvis, and extremities during the course of their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The goals of palliative treatment of bone metastases are pain relief, preservation of function, and maintenance of skeletal integrity. When bone pain is limited to a single or limited number of sites, local field external beam radiation therapy (RT) to the painful sites can provide pain relief in approximately 60 to 85 percent of cases, with complete pain response reported in 15 to 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If symptomatic lesions are widespread, radiopharmaceuticals or hemibody radiation may provide useful palliative alternatives. Although treatment can be effective for patients with mild, moderate, or severe pain, early intervention may be useful in maintaining quality of life and minimizing the side effects of analgesic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The use of RT for palliation of painful bone metastases will be reviewed here. Overviews of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of bone metastases and of the treatment approaches for bone metastases are presented separately, as are other aspects of cancer pain management, including the management of patients with epidural spinal cord compression, the use of image-guided thermal ablation for patients with pain from bone metastases that persists or recurs after RT, and management of patients with pathologic or impending pathologic fractures, including the role of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for patients with pathologic vertebral fractures.

RT is effective in partially or completely relieving pain in a majority of patients with bone metastases, although a transient worsening of pain may occur in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This typically occurs in the first few days after RT, and the flare in pain generally lasts one to two days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1325549791\"><span class=\"h2\">Single-dose versus fractionated treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with uncomplicated painful bone metastases (ie, without a substantial soft tissue component or <span class=\"nowrap\">fracture/impending</span> fracture), we suggest using a single fraction of 8 Gy to the involved area. This approach provides equal palliation with improved patient convenience and cost-effectiveness compared with fractionated schedules, although retreatment is needed more frequently. For patients with a relatively long life expectancy (such as six months or more), a fractionated regimen (such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 20 Gy in five fractions) is a reasonable alternative because of the reduced need for retreatment. </p><p>This recommendation is in keeping with evidence-based guidelines from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), which support single-fraction EBRT at a dose of 8 Gy to provide palliation for relief of pain from bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This approach is more convenient and cost-effective compared with fractionated schedules, and there is no evidence that the use of a single-fraction regimen is associated with an increase in acute or late toxicity. However, retreatment is necessary in a higher number of those initially treated with a single fraction compared with those initially managed with a fractionated regimen (approximately 20 versus 8 percent).</p><p>The effectiveness of a single fraction of 8 Gy compared with longer fractionated courses is illustrated by the three largest randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Dutch multicenter trial, 1171 patients with painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to 8 Gy in a single dose or to 24 Gy in six fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The palliative benefit was similar in both groups (overall pain relief in 72 and 69 percent of patients, respectively), as was the time to response (median three weeks in both groups). There was no difference in treatment-related toxicity. However, retreatment was required by significantly more patients treated with a single fraction (25 versus 7 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 9714, 949 patients with prostate or breast cancer and painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to 8 Gy in a single fraction or to 30 Gy in 10 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with evidence of cauda equina syndrome or epidural spinal cord compression were excluded. There were no significant differences in the rates for complete and partial pain relief (overall 66 percent in each group), the use of narcotics, or the incidence of subsequent pathologic fractures. However, patients treated with a single fraction were twice as likely to require retreatment (18 versus 9 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A British trial randomly assigned 765 patients with painful bone metastases to 8 Gy as a single fraction, 20 Gy in five fractions, or 30 Gy in 10 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With a median 12-month follow-up, there were no differences in any of the pain endpoints among the three groups (78 percent overall response rate with either single-dose or multidose schedules); there was no difference in time to response between the regimens (median less than one month in those responding). Patients treated with a single fraction were twice as likely to require reirradiation of the same site, but the majority could be successfully retreated with a single fraction.</p><p/><p>Despite these data, a year 2015 assessment of national practice suggests marked underutilization of single-fraction treatment approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434025621\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose of single-fraction radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single 8 Gy dose of RT is more effective than lower doses at providing pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>In a representative multicenter trial, 651 patients with painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to treatment with either 8 or 4 Gy as a single dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The main tumor types represented in the trial were breast, lung, and prostate cancer (35, 35, and 17 percent, respectively). The overall response rate was higher at 4, 8, and 52 weeks with the 8 Gy dose of radiation (83 versus 71, 91 versus 83, and 93 versus 82 percent, respectively). The retreatment rate was significantly lower in those given 8 Gy (14 versus 22 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3642747151\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course of relief and incidence of pain flare</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients receiving a single fraction of EBRT for a painful bone metastasis derive pain relief, and relief is often rapid. This was shown in an analysis of data from the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) symptom control trial SC.23, which examined the benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> to prevent pain flare (see below) in patients receiving EBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A total of 122 out of 298 patients (41 percent) had a beneficial response by day 10, while an additional 116 patients (39 percent) responded by day 42. These data provide support for the view that a single dose of RT should be offered to all patients with painful bone metastases, even those with poor expected survival.</p><p>A transient worsening of pain (&quot;pain flare&quot;) occurs in approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients undergoing RT for a painful bone metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>]. This typically occurs in the first few days after RT, and the flare in pain generally lasts one to two days.</p><p>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> may reduce the frequency of pain flare. In a double-blind trial, 298 patients with painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to either dexamethasone (8 mg daily for five days beginning one hour before a single dose of 8 Gy radiation) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The incidence of pain flare was decreased with dexamethasone compared with placebo (26 versus 35 percent, p = 0.05).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1359926420\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical fixation may be indicated prior to EBRT to decrease pain and facilitate rehabilitation in symptomatic bone metastases causing a pathologic fracture involving the long bones or other weight-bearing bones. In other cases, prophylactic fixation to prevent pathologic fractures, or surgical stabilization of an unstable spine may be recommended prior to EBRT. Mirels scoring system was developed to address the void in objective criteria for predicting fracture risk in the setting of metastatic disease to long bones, and it is outlined in the table and discussed in more detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90456 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], as is the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) for vertebral metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80396 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma#H199714550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Assessing the risk of fracture'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma#H1065839347\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Assessing spinal stability'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with inoperable fractures and those who are physically debilitated may achieve pain relief from palliative EBRT alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STEREOTACTIC RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotactic body RT (SBRT) utilizes precisely targeted radiation to a tumor while minimizing radiation to adjacent normal tissue, allowing treatment of small- or moderate-sized tumors in either a single or limited number of dose fractions. SBRT may have a role in treating selected patients with painful bone metastases. However, there are no published randomized trials directly comparing both approaches, and at least in the spine, the use of SBRT might be associated with a higher risk of vertebral compression fractures. In our view and that of others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], SBRT should be reserved mostly for patients who have persistent or recurrent bone pain after a standard course of external beam RT (EBRT). This view is in keeping with evidence-based guidelines on palliative RT for bone metastases from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>One setting in which SBRT may be preferred over EBRT is in the definitive treatment of patients with symptomatic bone metastases from relatively radioresistant neoplasms (eg, renal cell cancer, melanoma, sarcoma), especially in the setting of vertebral metastases with epidural extension but no high-grade epidural spinal cord compression. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H610740485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-therapeutic-approaches-for-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis-from-solid-tumors#H1931232115\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of therapeutic approaches for adult patients with bone metastasis from solid tumors&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>SBRT and single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are safe and effective for treatment of spine metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The role of SBRT for treatment of painful bone metastases is illustrated by a large series in which SBRT (12.5 to 25 Gy, median 20 Gy) was used to treat 393 patients (including 93 with renal cell and 38 with melanoma metastases), 69 percent of whom had received prior RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Long-term pain improvement was experienced by 86 percent of all patients, including 94 percent of those with renal cell cancer and 96 percent of patients with melanoma. Long-term tumor control was achieved in 90 percent of lesions treated with SRS as a primary treatment modality, including 87 percent of patients with renal cell cancer and 75 percent of those with melanoma. Of the 32 patients with a progressive neurologic deficit prior to treatment, 27 (84 percent) improved clinically.</p><p>However, the use of SBRT to treat spinal metastases may be associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture, which is an early acute or subacute side effect:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 252 patients in which 410 spinal segments were treated with SBRT, 57 fractures (14 percent) were observed, 27 of which were new and 30 of which were a progression of preexisting fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Multivariate analysis suggested that the risk was greatest in those treated with a single fraction of 20 Gy or greater and in those with a baseline fracture, lytic tumor, or spinal deformity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report of 448 patients (1070 vertebral bodies), 127 vertebral compression fractures (11.9 percent) in 97 patients were potentially SBRT induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In multivariate analysis, patients with prior vertebral compression fracture, primary hematologic malignancy, thoracic spine lesions, and lytic lesions had increased rates of developing fracture. Patients treated with fraction sizes &gt;18 Gy seemed to have a higher rate of fracture than did those treated at 16 to 18 Gy (3 of 31 versus 33 of 1030). The median time to develop a vertebral compression fracture was 2.7 months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4023416773\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RECURRENT OR PERSISTENT PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for patients who have persistent or recurrent bone pain following treatment with external beam RT include repeat irradiation with fractionated treatment (especially if single-fraction external beam RT was initially used), stereotactic RT, image-guided local thermal ablation, or radiopharmaceuticals.

Patients with multifocal bone pain usually are managed with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent (NSAID), unless they have a specific contraindication to use of these agents, in conjunction with an opioid and usually with an adjuvant analgesic (ie, osteoclast inhibitors, glucocorticoids) used specifically for bone pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-with-opioids-optimizing-analgesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;, section on 'Bone pain'</a>.)</p><p>Osteoclast inhibitors (including bisphosphonates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>) are indicated for the management of metastatic bone disease for most patients with solid tumors. Osteoclast inhibitors slow or reverse the progression of skeletal metastases and reduce the likelihood of skeletal-related events. In addition, they also have some analgesic benefit, although it is modest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;, section on 'Osteoclast inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>The vast majority of the data regarding the benefits of osteoclast inhibitors for prostate cancer were generated in the castration-resistant state; hence, for men with bone metastases from prostate cancer, the use of osteoclast inhibitors is generally restricted to those with castration-resistant disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-management#H365074098\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Management&quot;, section on 'Castration-resistant disease'</a>.)</p><p>For patients in whom skeletal-related events are unlikely (eg, those with minimal bone tumor burden) and for those with a limited expected survival (eg, in the setting of widespread and progressive visceral metastases), treatment with osteoclast inhibitors should be considered on a case-by-case basis. This subject, as well as other adjuvant analgesics, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoclast inhibitors for patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, and other solid tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-pain-management-adjuvant-analgesics-coanalgesics#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer pain management: Adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)&quot;, section on 'Bone pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a single or limited number of areas of painful bone metastases, we recommend external beam radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'External beam RT'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients, we suggest using a single fraction of 8 Gy to the involved area (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). This approach provides equal palliation with improved patient convenience and cost-effectiveness compared with fractionated schedules, although retreatment is needed more frequently. (See <a href=\"#H1325549791\" class=\"local\">'Single-dose versus fractionated treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a relatively long life expectancy (six months or longer), a fractionated regimen (such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 20 Gy in five fractions) is a reasonable alternative. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A transient worsening of pain (&quot;pain flare&quot;) occurs in approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients undergoing RT for a painful bone metastasis. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> may reduce the frequency of pain flare. (See <a href=\"#H3642747151\" class=\"local\">'Time course of relief and incidence of pain flare'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical consultation for fixation should be obtained prior to the institution of RT for bone metastases involving the long bones or other weight-bearing bones to treat or prevent a pathologic fracture. (See <a href=\"#H1359926420\" class=\"local\">'Need for surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma#H1148505276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma&quot;, section on 'General surgical principles'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stereotactic body RT utilizes precisely targeted radiation to a tumor while minimizing radiation to adjacent normal tissue, allowing treatment of small- or moderate-sized tumors in either a single or limited number of dose fractions. In our view, stereotactic body RT should be reserved mostly for patients who have persistent or recurrent pain after a standard course of external beam RT for painful bone metastases (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Stereotactic RT'</a> above). It may also prove efficacious for patients with symptomatic bone metastases from relatively radioresistant neoplasms (eg, renal cell cancer, melanoma, sarcoma), especially in the setting of vertebral metastases with epidural extension and no high-grade epidural spinal cord compression, although there are no randomized trials to support this use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H610740485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for patients who have persistent or recurrent bone pain following treatment with external beam RT include repeat irradiation with fractionated treatment (especially if single-fraction external beam RT was initially used), stereotactic body RT, image-guided local thermal ablation, <span class=\"nowrap\">kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty</span> for vertebral compression fractures, or radiopharmaceuticals. (See <a href=\"#H4023416773\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of recurrent or persistent pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Reirradiation may be indicated if there is an incomplete response to initial treatment or if severe pain recurs and the patient's overall condition permits. Clinical trials data suggest that acceptable regimens include a single fraction of 8 Gy or a brief fractionated regimen of 20 Gy, although the latter can be associated with higher acute toxicity. For selected patients with a good performance status and recurrence in the spine, stereotactic body RT is another option, where available. (See <a href=\"#H768213264\" class=\"local\">'Reirradiation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Stereotactic RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with multiple bone metastases have diffuse pain that is not easily managed by focal radiation. There are two options in such circumstances: systemic administration of a bone-targeted radioisotope, and hemibody irradiation. (See <a href=\"#H638383468\" class=\"local\">'Management of patients with diffuse bone pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with painful bone metastases, supportive care should include adequate analgesia and the use of osteoclast inhibitors to enhance analgesia and reduce the risk of skeletal-related events (including the need for radiation or surgery to bone, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy).
