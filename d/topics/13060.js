GBS is an acute monophasic paralyzing illness, usually provoked by a preceding infection. GBS occurs world-wide and all age groups are affected.</p><p>Historically, GBS was considered a single disorder. It now is recognized as a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms. The major forms are acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), the Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and acute sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Each form of GBS has distinguishing clinical, pathophysiologic, and pathologic features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of GBS will be reviewed here. Other aspects of GBS are discussed separately.

The end result is an acute polyneuropathy. This immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve.</p><p>Immune reactions directed against epitopes in Schwann cell surface membrane or myelin can cause acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (AIDP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pathology is that of multifocal inflammatory demyelination starting at the level of the nerve roots. The earliest changes are frequently seen at the nodes of Ranvier. Both the cellular and humoral immune responses participate in the process. Invasion by activated T-cells is followed by macrophage-mediated demyelination with evidence of complement and immunoglobulin deposition on myelin and Schwann cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. No specific myelin antigen(s) have been identified.</p><p>Immune reactions against epitopes contained in the axonal membrane cause the acute axonal forms of GBS: acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These forms are uncommon in the United States, but the pathophysiology of these variants is better understood than that of AIDP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mimicry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A case report from Japan in 1990 linking AMAN to a preceding infection with Campylobacter jejuni and antibodies to GM1 (monosialoganglioside) prompted interest in the role of Campylobacter and antiganglioside antibodies in GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Studies in Chinese patients with AMAN have shown antibody and complement deposition on peripheral nerve axons, followed by attachment of macrophages and axonal collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In AMSAN, the same process is more severe and leads to full axonal degeneration.</p><p>The following observations provide insight into the mechanism of nerve dysfunction, and support the hypothesis that GBS is evoked by antecedent infection that triggers the immune system to attack components of the peripheral nerve through molecular mimicry:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of GBS are preceded by infection (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Antecedent events'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with C. jejuni can generate antibodies to specific gangliosides, including GM1, GD1a, GalNac-GD1a, and GD1b, which are strongly associated with AMAN or AMSAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, C. jejuni infection can generate antibodies to GQ1b ganglioside, a component of oculomotor nerve myelin, that are associated with MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with C. jejuni enteritis not complicated by GBS do not produce the specific anti-ganglioside antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Genetic polymorphisms in liposaccharide biosynthesis genes in C. jejuni that modify ganglioside expression as well as immunogenetic factors in the host are thought to play a role in the development of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are shared ganglioside antigens between peripheral nerve components and the outer core of the lipo-oligosaccharide coat of the Campylobacter jejuni bacterium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rabbits sensitized with C. jejuni lipooligosaccharide or GM1 develop anti-GM1 IgG antibodies, flaccid limb weakness, and pathologic changes in peripheral nerves identical with those present in patients with axonal GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p>Further studies in this rabbit model have emphasized that anti-GM1 antibodies bind to voltage-gated sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier. Similarly, the anti-GQ1b antibodies in a mouse model of MFS bind to sodium channels at the presynaptic nerve terminal. This process causes sodium channel blockade that may lead to reversible nerve conduction failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The antibody binding is complement dependent and ameliorated by complement inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>There is also an association between infection with Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, and specific glycolipid antigens in GBS, but these relationships are not as well documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603782914\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic changes depend upon the form of GBS. In acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and the Miller Fisher variant, a focal inflammatory response develops against myelin-producing Schwann cells or peripheral myelin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]. Infiltration of the epineural and endoneural small vessels (mostly veins) by lymphocytes and monocytes causes segmental myelin degeneration throughout the nerve. The inflammation is more intense at the junction of the dorsal and ventral roots.</p><p>The demyelination blocks electrical conduction along the nerve. Axonal degeneration occurs as a secondary response; the extent relates to the intensity of the inflammatory response. All myelinated nerves (motor, sensory, cranial, sympathetic) can be affected. The breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier at the dural attachment allows transudation of plasma proteins into the cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>In the motor and motor-sensory variants, the axon is affected without an inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. The primary immune process is directed at the nodes of Ranvier (short intervals between successive segments of the myelin sheath of a nerve), leading to functional axonal involvement with conduction block caused by paranodal myelin detachment, node lengthening, sodium channel dysfunction, and altered ion and water homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This process can rapidly reverse in some cases, or may progress to axonal degeneration in others. The motor nerves are involved at the ventral roots, peripheral nerve, and the preterminal intramuscular motor twigs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the motor-sensory variant, sensory nerves also are affected.</p><p>In a study of 29 children with GBS in China, electrodiagnostic studies correlated with sural nerve biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients classified as having acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy based upon a physiologic pattern consistent with demyelination commonly had macrophage-mediated demyelination and lymphocytic infiltration. In children with acute motor axonal neuropathy, sural nerves were normal or had few degenerating fibers without lymphocytic infiltration or complement activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTECEDENT EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As already noted, antecedent infections are common with GBS, and are thought to trigger the immune response that leads to acute polyneuropathy. Approximately two-thirds of patients give a history of an antecedent respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Campylobacter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Campylobacter jejuni infection is the most commonly identified precipitant of GBS. A case-control study from the United Kingdom involving 103 patients with the disease found that 26 percent of affected individuals had evidence of recent C. jejuni infection, compared with 2 percent of household and 1 percent of age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of note, only 70 percent of those infected with C. jejuni reported a diarrheal illness within 12 weeks before GBS onset.</p><p>Other studies have found that about 60 to 70 percent of AMAN and AMSAN cases and up to 30 percent of AIDP cases are preceded by C. jejuni infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, campylobacter-associated GBS appears to have a worse prognosis, manifested by slower recovery and greater residual neurologic disability, than other forms of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A study from Sweden estimated that the risk for developing GBS during the two months following a symptomatic episode of C. jejuni infection was approximately 100-fold higher than the risk in the general population, with GBS developing in an estimated 0.03 percent of patients with C. jejuni enteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>There are significant geographical differences in Campylobacter jejuni infection. Certain strains of Campylobacter jejuni have been associated with GBS in Japan (strain O-19) and South Africa (strain O-41) but not in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBS also occurs in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, predominantly in those who are not profoundly immunocompromised. The clinical course and prognosis of GBS in patients with HIV infection appears to be similar to GBS in patients without HIV infection.</p><p>GBS can occur in any stage of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. GBS has been reported after acute HIV seroconversion and following immune reconstitution from highly-active antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple reports have found an increased risk of GBS following influenza-like illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. In one study from the United Kingdom, the relative risk of GBS from 0 to 90 days after an influenza-like illness was 7.4 (95% CI 4.4-12.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, antecedent cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections have been associated with GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. As an example, a case-control study from the Netherlands evaluated 308 patients for serologic evidence of infection with 16 agents, and found that recent infection with C. jejuni, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus was significantly more common on multivariate analysis among patients who developed GBS than among matched control patients who had other neurologic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Patients with HIV infection were excluded from this series.</p><p>Less commonly, GBS has been reported following infection with varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses, and the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. The importance of these infectious agents as triggers of GBS is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3508848512\"><span class=\"h3\">Zika virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an association of Zika virus infection with GBS, though a direct causal relationship has not been firmly established. This issue is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zika-virus-infection-an-overview#H506945238\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zika virus infection: An overview&quot;, section on 'Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other triggering events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small percentage of patients develop GBS after another triggering event such as immunization, surgery, trauma, and bone-marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In one report, GBS was associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist therapy in 16 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Another report noted two patients who developed GBS associated with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>, but it is unclear whether there is any causal link [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. GBS has also been linked to systemic processes, including Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome has followed vaccinations, but this danger may be overstated. In a retrospective study that analyzed a northern California healthcare database over an ascertainment period from 1994 through 2006, there was no increased risk of incident GBS following any vaccination and all vaccinations combined, whether using a 6 week or 10 week risk interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Influenza vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, an increased risk of GBS was associated with the swine influenza vaccine in 1976, although the severity of the risk has been controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Subsequent data suggest that influenza vaccination is associated with a low or negligible risk of GBS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who received either the 1992-1993 or 1993-1994 influenza vaccinations were not at significantly increased risk for GBS, but combining the two seasons suggested that influenza vaccination resulted in approximately one additional case of GBS per million patients inoculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of data from six adverse event monitoring systems found that the 2009 H1N1 influenza A vaccine used in the United states was associated with a small increased risk of GBS (relative risk 2.35, 95% CI 1.42-4.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The number of excess GBS cases was estimated to be 1.6 per one million people vaccinated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based cohort study from Quebec evaluating the H1N1 vaccination during the fall of 2009 found a small but significantly increased risk of GBS during the 8-week postvaccination period (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.80, 95% CI 1.12-2.87) and during the 4-week postvaccination period (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.63-4.62) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The number of excess GBS cases attributable to the vaccine was approximately two per one million doses.

There were no cases of recurrent GBS among 107 patients who received influenza vaccination after the initial diagnosis of GBS, and none of the six individuals with recurrent GBS had any vaccine exposure in the two months prior to the onset of the second episode of GBS.</p><p/><p>Thus, the small risk of GBS associated with influenza vaccination, on the order of one to two excess cases of GBS per million people vaccinated, is substantially less than the overall health risk posed by naturally occurring influenza.
