There are several limitations to the application of these data. During the study period, adolescents underwent routine cervical cancer screening based upon the guidelines at that time. Thus, high-grade abnormalities in this age group had already been diagnosed and treated, leaving a lower-risk group in the remaining patient population. Therefore, it is not certain that these data can be generalized to current practice, since screening recommendations now advise to initiate cervical cancer screening at age 21 years. </p><p>In addition, Kaiser Permanente has an excellent tracking and patient recall program that can effectively bring patients in for follow-up at varying time intervals and with varying characteristics (eg, age, previous results). This level of tracking and patient contact may not be attainable in many other healthcare settings.

Prior to the introduction of HPV testing, repeating the Pap test was the standard approach to an ASC-US Pap.</p><p>Most clinics use HPV triage, and do so using a protocol called reflex HPV testing. That is, if a Pap test is ASC-US, the specimen is then also tested for HPV. Use of HPV testing to triage further evaluation of ASC-US has several advantages compared with other strategies. Most importantly, HPV triage is the most effective at detecting CIN 2,3 or cervical cancer. Reflex HPV testing has an additional advantage of saving the patient the inconvenience of a second visit for HPV testing. HPV triage also results in fewer women being referred to colposcopy than a strategy of immediate colposcopy for all cases of ASC-US, and thus avoids the cost, inconvenience, and discomfort of unnecessary procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

As a reference standard, all patients had cytology every six months for two years, and colposcopy was performed only for a cytologic finding of HSIL. The rate of referral to colposcopy was lowest in the conservative management group, followed by HPV triage, and by definition, immediate colposcopy (12 versus 56 versus 100 percent). Sensitivity for detection of CIN 3 was highest in the HPV triage group, while it was similar for the immediate colposcopy and conservative management groups (72 versus 54 and 55 percent). The ALTS study was performed before the 2001 Bethesda system for classification of cervical cytology, so the category of ASC-US included ASC-H at that time. Thus, the background rate of HPV infection and CIN 3 in women with ASC-US was likely higher in this population than in later studies.</p><p>Meta-analyses that included subsequent studies have affirmed these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In one meta-analysis that included 39 comparative studies (three were randomized trials), among women with ASC-US cytology, HPV reflex testing had a significantly higher sensitivity for detection of CIN 2+ compared with repeat cervical cytology (91 versus 72 percent). Specificity was moderate to poor for both approaches (61 and 68 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Cost-effectiveness studies using mathematical models have consistently found reflex HPV testing to be the least expensive approach for United States women with ASC-US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/14,15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,20</a>]. Comparison groups included ignoring ASC as a potentially pathologic finding, immediate colposcopy, repeat cytology, and two-visit HPV testing. However, the results of these cost analyses were influenced by the age of the population screened. Although HPV testing performed similarly for the detection of high-grade lesions in all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the rate of colposcopy referral was significantly lower in women &ge;29 years of age than in younger women because of the decreasing prevalence of HPV with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76523\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76523 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In terms of application of HPV triage, 12 percent of women in this group in the ALTS study were referred for colposcopy, but a meta-analysis found a wide range of HPV positivity in women with ASC-US: 23 to 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A further option for the triage of ASC-US Paps is to perform HPV genotyping. The results of HPV testing are reported as positive or negative for any of the high-risk HPV types. HPV genotyping tests for types 16 and 18, which are associated with the highest risk of cervical cancer. Use of HPV genotyping to evaluate ASC-US has been proposed, but high-risk HPV types other than 16 and 18 are associated with a risk of CIN 3 or more severe disease (CIN 3+) of at least 5 percent, and thus warrant colposcopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24</a>]. Thus, HPV genotyping would not result in a change in management from a positive HPV test, but would add cost. (See <a href=\"#H941608\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for evaluation strategies'</a> above.)</p><p>For the repeat cytology strategy, this approach is based upon the potential that a significant abnormality will be missed on a single repeat smear (15 to 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], as well as inter- and intraobserver variability in diagnosis of ASC. The disadvantages of this approach are the need for multiple follow-up visits, potential delay in histologic diagnosis, and a lack of data regarding optimum frequency and duration of testing. As noted above, the interval for repeating cytology is based upon the five-year risk of CIN 3+ of 1.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although increasingly more uncommon, the guidelines committee recognized that not all clinical settings have access to HPV testing. (See <a href=\"#H941608\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for evaluation strategies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26537698\" class=\"local\">'Risk of premalignant or malignant disease'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H241730\"><span class=\"h4\">Persistent HPV-positive ASC-US</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with persistent HPV-positive ASC-US and negative colposcopy present a clinical challenge. Women with persistent HPV infection are at a higher risk of cervical neoplasia than those with transient infection. Based upon the guidelines described above, these women require annual colposcopy. Although this may be inconvenient and uncomfortable, it appears reasonable for women ages 25 or older based upon the risk of high-grade CIN or cervical cancer.</p><p>HPV infection is transient in most patients, but some patients have persistent infection. As an example, in one study of women who were HPV-positive and had negative cytology, HPV testing remained positive in 48 percent after one year, but in only 12 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>HPV infection is the etiology of the majority of cervical cancers, and a single positive HPV result is associated with an increased risk. The further increased risk with persistent HPV infection has been illustrated in multiples studies. As an example, in a study of over 32,000 women, the five-year risk of CIN 3+ in women with a single HPV-positive test and negative cytology was 4.5 percent, but this risk increased to 7.4 percent in women who were again HPV-positive, cytology-negative one year later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, a study of 8656 women ages 20 to 29 who had two HPV tests two years apart reported a five-year risk of CIN 3+ of approximately 2 percent in women with a single positive HPV test compared with 8 percent in those with two positive HPV tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Unfortunately, the risk of cervical neoplasia in women with persistent HPV infection and a negative or low-grade colposcopy has not been studied.</p><p>In patients with persistent HPV-positive ASC-US and negative colposcopy, it is important to make sure that a lesion has not been missed. Endocervical sampling should be considered. If adequate colposcopy (the entire squamocolumnar junction and all lesions are completely visualized) cannot be achieved for two or more examinations, the patient should be referred to a clinician with more experience in colposcopy.</p><p>HPV vaccination is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination#H5968479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;, section on 'Preexisting HPV-associated disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403222\"><span class=\"h4\">Persistent HPV-negative ASC-US</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent HPV-negative ASC-US occurs in some women. This is most likely due to inflammation or atrophy. Based on the guidelines described above, such women can be followed with <span class=\"nowrap\">HPV/cervical</span> cytology co-testing every three years if there are no symptoms of postcoital or abnormal uterine bleeding and if a pelvic examination is normal.</p><p>In a large study, the five-year risk of CIN 3+ in women with HPV-negative ASC-US (0.43 percent) was similar to those with negative cytology alone regardless of HPV testing (0.26 percent), but they had a higher risk than those with negative cytology and negative HPV testing (0.08 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, based upon the principle of &quot;equal management of equal risks&quot;, these findings support repeating <span class=\"nowrap\">HPV/cytology</span> co-testing in three years. The exception to this are women 60 years and older, in whom HPV-negative ASC-US should be re-evaluated in one year given the higher risk of cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"#H941608\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for evaluation strategies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H941401\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448602\"><span class=\"h2\">Women ages 21 to 24</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommendations for follow-up for abnormal cervical screening results differ for women ages 21 to 24 years from those for women age 25 and older. These rely less upon HPV testing and also advise colposcopy only if abnormal cytology results are severe or persistent. This is because the risk of cervical cancer is lower in this patient population.</p><p>From 1999 to 2008 in the United States, the annual incidence of cervical cancer among women ages 20 to 24 was 1.4 per 100,000 women compared with women ages 25 to 39 for whom the incidence was 5.9 to 14.2 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The risks of high-grade disease in women with ASC-US are lower in younger women. (See <a href=\"#H26537698\" class=\"local\">'Risk of premalignant or malignant disease'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, the rate of HPV infection is high in this patient population, and cervical intraepithelial lesions often regress spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. The prevalence of high-risk HPV infection in women aged 18 to 25 was 40.4 percent in a study of over 9000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Unfortunately, there are few data about the prevalence of HPV infection in women in this age group stratified by ASC-US cytology. In women ages 30 to 34, 56 percent of women with ASC-US are HPV-positive, and by extrapolation, the rate is likely higher in younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In terms of regression of lesions, for example, in a prospective study (n = 95), CIN 2 lesions regressed in 70 percent of females aged 13 to 24 (mean 20.4 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. By contrast, regression rates are lower in older women, approximately 30 to 50 percent in studies with two years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>]. For CIN 3, in women ages 20 to 24 years, the estimated progression rate from CIN 3 to cancer in one year is 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The rate increases with age, reaching 10 percent per year for women age 80 and older. Given the difficulty interpreting HPV testing results in this patient population and the likelihood or lesion regression, for women ages 21 to 24 years with ASC-US cytology, we prefer repeat cytology in 12 months rather than reflex HPV testing.</p><p>The recommendations for cervical cancer screening in women ages 21 to 29 include cervical cytology alone, without use of HPV testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 3</a>). This age range differs somewhat from the guidelines for evaluations of cytologic and histologic abnormalities, which differ for age 21 to 24 compared with 25 and older.

A finding of ASC requires further evaluation to exclude the presence of a precancerous or cancerous condition. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H941681\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recommendations for follow-up for abnormal cervical screening results differ for women ages 21 to 24 years from those for women 25 and older. These rely less upon human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and also advise colposcopy only if abnormal results are severe or persistent. This is because the risk of cervical cancer is low in this patient population. (See <a href=\"#H448602\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 21 to 24'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women with ASC-US, colposcopy may be deferred until six weeks postpartum. For ASC-H, colposcopy should be performed and should not be deferred until the postpartum period. Endocervical curettage should not be done during pregnancy, but gentle sampling of the endocervical canal with a cytobrush may be performed. Cervical biopsy should be done only if a high-grade abnormality is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H941351\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of postmenopausal and immunocompromised women with cervical cytology abnormalities is the same as for other women. (See <a href=\"#H941401\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> above and <a href=\"#H171887073\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised women'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">ASC-US</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred approach for evaluation of women ages 25 or older with ASC-US cytology is testing for high-risk types of HPV with triage of women who test positive to colposcopy. Use of HPV testing to triage further evaluation of ASC-US is the most effective strategy for detecting high-grade premalignant disease or cervical cancer. Reflex HPV testing has the additional advantage that it saves the patient from the inconvenience of a second visit for HPV testing. (See <a href=\"#H448016\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 25 or older'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat cytology in one year is a reasonable alternative to HPV triage if HPV testing is not available. Colposcopy is performed if repeat cytology shows ASC-US or a more severe cervical abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H448016\" class=\"local\">'Women ages 25 or older'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women ages 21 to 24 years with ASC-US cytology, we suggest repeating cytology at 12 months rather than reflex HPV testing.
