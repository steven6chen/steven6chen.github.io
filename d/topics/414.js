The lifetime probability of developing breast cancer is one in six overall (one in eight for invasive disease). It is a heterogeneous, phenotypically diverse disease composed of several biologic subtypes that have distinct behaviors and responses to therapy.</p><p>The use of adjuvant systemic therapy is responsible for much of the reduction in cause-specific mortality from breast cancer seen in almost every Western nation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adjuvant chemotherapy refers to the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy after breast cancer surgery, administered with the goal of eradicating microscopic foci of cancer cells that, if untreated, could grow and recur as metastatic cancer. In general, similar chemotherapy regimens are used as adjuvant chemotherapy regardless as to whether tumors are estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PR) receptor positive or negative. Treatment directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is incorporated for those patients with HER2 overexpression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the role of chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer, how to estimate the benefit and risk of chemotherapy, the indications for adjuvant chemotherapy, and the dosing and timing of treatment. Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data.

Genomic analysis and benefit-risk calculators are also employed to help determine appropriate candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with ER-positive tumors. In many instances, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are rather modest, and patient preferences are relevant to treatment decision-making. The approach towards patients who received neoadjuvant treatment is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3753530388\" class=\"local\">'Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence in women with early-stage breast cancer. However, the absolute benefits may be small and not worth the added risk of toxicity among women with a baseline low risk of recurrence. Similarly, there are patients with substantial comorbid conditions or markedly advanced age such that chemotherapy is neither feasible nor likely to change overall survival. The discussion below assumes that the patient has sufficient general health and life expectancy to warrant discussion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Our general approach to treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, early-stage breast cancer uses a risk-stratified approach based on the presence of factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence. It is summarized below according to biologic subtype:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H397637268\"><span class=\"h2\">Among hormone receptor-negative cancers (&quot;triple-negative tumors&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard for patients with triple-negative breast cancer and either a tumor size &gt;0.5 cm or pathologically involved lymph nodes (regardless of tumor size). Patients with tumors that do not express hormone receptors (ie, ER- and PR-negative) are not candidates for endocrine therapy, and as the tumor is HER2 negative, they are not candidates for anti-HER2 therapy, either. Therefore, our threshold for the use of chemotherapy in these patients is low because this is the only form of adjuvant treatment available to them, and because studies have suggested a significant risk of recurrence if left untreated. The prognosis of small (&lt;0.5 cm), node-negative, triple-negative tumors is generally favorable. For that reason, the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are very small, and must be weighed against the chances of serious side effects of chemotherapy. Patients with microinvasive or very small (1 to 3 mm) tumors generally do not need chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H682639999\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Tumor size'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The approach to patients who have received neoadjuvant treatment is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3753530388\" class=\"local\">'Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449988865\"><span class=\"h2\">Among hormone receptor-positive breast cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy treatment decision-making for women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers is more complicated, owing to the variation in prognosis among women with ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors, the effectiveness of adjuvant endocrine therapy at reducing recurrence, and the variable sensitivity of ER-positive tumors to chemotherapy treatments. For such patients, the decision to administer chemotherapy is based on an assessment of the composite risk of recurrence and likely benefit of treatment based upon patient age, tumor lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion, or the results of a gene expression profile such as the Recurrence Score (RS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Most instances of ER-positive breast cancer &lt;1 cm, and all cancers &lt;0.5 cm, have a good prognosis with endocrine therapy alone, and do not typically require adjuvant chemotherapy. At the other end of the risk spectrum, most women with stage III breast cancers will warrant adjuvant chemotherapy because of their risk of recurrence and the likely benefits of chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>The majority of cases of ER-positive breast cancer fall in between these two extremes, and decisions regarding the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy should be individualized. In general, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers that are low grade, strongly ER and PR positive, with low measures of proliferation have a good prognosis with endocrine treatment alone. By contrast, tumors that are high grade, with higher measures of proliferation and lower levels of <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/PR</span> expression, tend to be less sensitive to endocrine treatment and more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. To guide clinical decision-making, gene expression profiles such as the RS, EndoPredict, the Breast Cancer Index (BCI), and the PAM50 intrinsic subtype assay have been developed to identify patients with such a low chance of recurrence that the absolute benefit of chemotherapy may not justify the risk of toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By contrast, patients with higher scores on these assays have a sufficiently high risk of recurrence despite endocrine therapy that the addition of chemotherapy outweighs the risk of toxicities. Moreover, given that the response to treatment is not uniform among all cancers, these assays may identify those cancers that, based on their biologic profile, are likely to have an excellent outcome with endocrine therapy alone versus those in which the addition of chemotherapy would substantially reduce the risk of recurrence.</p><p>Among the gene expression profiles, the 21-gene RS is the most well-validated, providing a prognostic signature for outcome with endocrine therapy alone. In addition, the RS is the only assay shown to predict the benefit from chemotherapy for women with ER-positive breast cancer and either limited or no nodal involvement. Patients with ER-positive cancers that are node negative derive substantial benefit from chemotherapy if the 21-gene RS is high (typically, &gt;24). By contrast, if the score is low (&lt;18), there is no marginal benefit to adding chemotherapy to endocrine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Whether women with intermediate scores should receive adjuvant chemotherapy is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial (TAILORx) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A separate prospective study (PlanB) has demonstrated that women with limited nodal involvement (one to three nodes) who have low recurrence scores (&lt;12) also have exceptionally good outcomes without the addition of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The development and validation of the RS is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H103670824\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Recurrence Score (RS)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H2276823736\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Limited support for use in node-positive disease'</a>.)</p><p>Other gene expression profiles can also provide prognostic information on outcomes with endocrine treatment. For example, tumors that are typed as luminal A in the PAM50 intrinsic subtype assay have a very good prognosis without chemotherapy; those that are luminal B are more likely to recur with endocrine treatment alone, and may warrant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H103670818\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Gene expression profiles'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to patients who have received neoadjuvant treatment is discussed below.

Risk calculators have been developed to estimate a specific patient's risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality and the benefit that may be derived from chemotherapy (and where appropriate, endocrine therapy). These calculators should not, however, be considered a substitute for molecular diagnostic assays, as they do not take into account all biomarkers and relationships between tumor biology and treatment effects. Of the available calculators, our preferred tool is Adjuvant! Online, which is the most widely studied and validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>].</p><p>Adjuvant!

In over 5000 women, the use of anthracyclines administered at &quot;standard&quot; doses, when compared with CMF, was associated with similar recurrence risk (41 versus 42 percent), breast cancer mortality (32 versus 33 percent), and overall mortality (33 versus 35 percent) at 10 years.

For patients with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer and either a tumor size &gt;0.5 cm or pathologically involved lymph nodes (regardless of tumor size), we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Risk of recurrence increases on a continuum, such that larger tumors are more likely to derive benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy than smaller ones. We do not typically administer adjuvant chemotherapy for node-negative tumors that are &lt;0.5 cm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, hormone receptor-positive disease, the decision to administer chemotherapy is based on an assessment of the composite risk of recurrence and likely benefit of treatment based upon patient age, tumor stage (lymph node status, size), grade, lymphovascular invasion, or the results of a gene expression profile such as the Recurrence Score (RS). Adjuvant chemotherapy has a critical role in many estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers, for example in stage III breast cancers as well as those with a high recurrence score or luminal B features. By contrast, adjuvant chemotherapy does not have a role in stage 1 or 2 breast cancers with low recurrence scores or luminal A features.

We prefer the dose-dense regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> every two weeks for four cycles followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>&nbsp;every two weeks for four cycles (AC-T).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although no regimen has proved to be superior to AC-T, the nonanthracycline-based regimen <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> given every three weeks for four cycles (TC) may be an appropriate strategy for patients who have indications for chemotherapy but have lower-risk disease. TC may also be appropriate for those with a history of cardiac disease and those unwilling to accept the risks of anthracycline-based therapy. A decision on the treatment administered should take into account patient convenience and the side effects of each combination. (See <a href=\"#H31949206\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H375568921\" class=\"local\">'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically started within four to six weeks after definitive breast surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1404371166\" class=\"local\">'Sequencing chemotherapy and radiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who have residual disease after completing a standard course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we suggest a course of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients with triple-negative disease may be more likely to derive benefit from this approach. However, given the added toxicities, observation rather than further chemotherapy is also an appropriate option.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For older women (&gt;70 years), the decision to utilize chemotherapy is complicated by an increased number of comorbidities, which means that the impact of chemotherapy on daily function may be greater, and the benefits of chemotherapy may be lower. Nevertheless, age itself is not a definitive reason for not giving chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2719008\" class=\"local\">'Older women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard, weight-based drug doses should be administered to obese patients, despite the expected high doses required.
