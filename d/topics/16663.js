PNENs exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical behavior that has made classification and staging difficult. While the majority of PNENs are associated with relatively good survival, there can be significant variability in outcomes based on their biological heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of PNENs is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The term &quot;pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm&quot; is preferred to encompass a diverse set of tumors arising in the pancreas that share a common progenitor cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The well-differentiated forms are referred to as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). In general, poorly differentiated PNENs are high-grade lesions that are referred to as neuroendocrine carcinomas with aggressive biologic behavior, and medical rather than surgical therapy is usually more appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This topic will focus predominantly on well-differentiated PNETs. (See <a href=\"#H13895677\" class=\"local\">'Staging and tumor classification'</a> below.)</p><p>In the past, PNETs were often referred to as pancreatic &quot;islet cell&quot; tumors or pancreatic &quot;carcinoids.&quot; With time, the term carcinoid has come to mean a very specific group of well-differentiated tumors, predominantly arising in the tubular gastrointestinal tract, which produces only serotonin. However, endocrine tumors of the pancreas can express other hormones or can be biochemically inert.

The surgical management of sporadic PNETs is reviewed here. The management of PNETs associated with genetic syndromes is discussed separately.

This is important because the association of a genetic syndrome, MEN1 for instance, affects the number and extent of primary PNETs, which greatly impacts surgical decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The management of PNETs associated with genetic syndromes is discussed separately.

It is extremely difficult to predict the course of disease in the patient with PNET. As an example, a small tumor size does not necessarily mean that it is benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similarly, a diagnosis of malignant PNET cannot always be secured or excluded simply based upon histology. The only reliable indicators of a malignant tumor are the presence of invasion, metastases, or tumor recurrence. The natural history of malignant PNETs is also variable, with some large metastatic tumors having a very indolent course and some small isolated tumors having a very aggressive course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H799304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Morphology and immunohistochemistry'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352275740\"><span class=\"h3\">Functionality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical classification divides sporadic PNETs into functional and nonfunctional tumors. Clinical symptoms and biochemical evidence of hormone excess determine the tumor's functional status (not histologic appearance or the results of immunohistochemical staining). In the preoperative period, once the diagnosis of a functional tumor is made biochemically, the next step is to localize and stage the tumor radiographically. Although functionality may impact prognosis (eg, insulinomas are generally indolent tumors), the biologic behavior of most functional neuroendocrine tumors is defined by the grade and stage of the tumor. (See <a href=\"#H352275794\" class=\"local\">'Localization and malignant potential'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13895677\" class=\"local\">'Staging and tumor classification'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H799428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Functionality and nomenclature'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonfunctional &ndash; The majority of PNETs have no defined clinical syndrome and no elevated hormone levels. As such, the presentation of nonfunctional PNETs is often delayed. Patients often present late in their course with symptoms of mass effect or with symptoms related to metastases, including abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. As the threshold for abdominal imaging steadily decreases, nonfunctional tumors are frequently identified as incidental findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H24623092\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional &ndash; Patients with functional (ie, hormone-secreting) tumors present clinically with syndromes of excess gastrointestinal hormone production (insulin, serotonin, gastrin, VIP [vasoactive intestinal peptide], glucagon, or somatostatin) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111380\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111380 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In general, the aggressiveness of PNETs (grade based on histologic features) does not correlate with presence or type of hormone production. Once a diagnosis of a functional tumor has been made biochemically, it is generally unnecessary to repeat any studies. (See <a href=\"#H352275794\" class=\"local\">'Localization and malignant potential'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Briefly:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insulinoma &ndash; Insulinoma is the most functional common neoplasm of the endocrine pancreas. Up to 90 percent of insulinomas are benign, and they can be sporadic or associated with MEN1 syndrome. Most patients present with severe hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrinoma &ndash; Gastrinomas produce the hormone gastrin. The consequences of hypergastrinemia are gastric acid hypersecretion and its related peptic complications. Patients are classified as having sporadic or familial (ie, associated with MEN1) gastrinoma. This distinction is important as management differs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The consequences of excess VIP secretion include large-volume secretory diarrhea and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to surgery, all patients with VIPoma require correction of dehydration, hypokalemia, and other metabolic abnormalities. Preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> administration can reduce the levels of circulating VIP and is the treatment of choice to control large-volume secretory diarrhea and improve electrolyte management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

The consequences of excess glucagon secretion are a syndrome that includes a characteristic skin rash (necrolytic migratory erythema, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73263\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73263 \">picture 1</a>)), diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, weight loss, thrombophlebitis, glossitis, and anemia.

Excess somatostatin secretion produces a characteristic syndrome that includes steatorrhea, mild diabetes, and cholelithiasis. The diagnosis is typically delayed, and approximately 75 percent have metastasized, often to the liver, at the time of diagnosis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H12145128\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Indium-111 pentetreotide (OctreoScan)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H1022820058\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Functional PET imaging with 68-Ga DOTATATE'</a>.)</p><p>For pancreatic tumors, endoscopic ultrasound has a sensitivity ranging from 86 to 93 percent. When combined with spiral CT, the sensitivity approaches 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Endoscopic fine needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor can confirm the presence of neuroendocrine cells, identify regional lymphadenopathy, and may help determine the proliferative index (eg, Ki67), which in turn can help grade the lesion, which is important for prognostic stratification and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H13895677\" class=\"local\">'Staging and tumor classification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13895677\"><span class=\"h3\">Staging and tumor classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2006 and 2007, the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) proposed a staging scheme similar to most other types of epithelial neoplasms for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the digestive tract, including PNETs; it was accompanied by a histologic grading system that could be applied to all stages of NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This grading proposal was later endorsed by the joint American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC), although they modified the ENETS tumor, node, metastases (TNM) staging proposal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The newest version of the TNM staging classification (eighth edition, 2017) has a staging system for neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111355 \">table 2</a>) that is separate from that used for exocrine pancreatic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H13525387\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Staging system'</a>.)</p><p>Measures of the proliferative index, like Ki67, are used to assign grades and have also been shown to have prognostic power for PNETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Prior to 2017, there were two categories of tumor classification. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors were separated into low-grade (G1, Ki-67 index &lt;3 percent) and intermediate-grade (G2, Ki-67 index 3 to 20 percent) categories according to proliferative rate. Poorly differentiated tumors were all considered to represent high-grade (G3, Ki-67 index &gt;20- percent) neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). However, in recognition of the fact that a subset of high-grade NETs are well to moderately well differentiated, the most recent updated 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of endocrine organs has modified the grading scheme for pancreatic NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Well-differentiated pancreatic NETs are now classified as G1 (PanNET G1), G2 (PanNET G2), or G3 (PanNET G3), and the terminology for high-grade poorly differentiated tumors is PanNEC G3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H2474956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on '2010 WHO classification and 2017 update'</a>.)</p><p>In general, we prefer the terms PNET G1, PNET G2, and PNET G3 to designate well-differentiated PNETs or varying grades, and PNEC to designate a high-grade poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm. The majority of sporadic PNETs are G1 or G2, and they are associated with a relatively prolonged natural history, even when metastatic. PanNEC G3 lesions behave aggressively and are typically treated with systemic chemotherapy, even when apparently localized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The natural history and clinical behavior of PNET G3 tumors is in between that of PNET <span class=\"nowrap\">G1/2</span> tumors and PNEC G3 tumors. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H441838886\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'High-grade, well-differentiated tumors'</a>.) </p><p>An important point is that while histologic grade is a useful measure of prognosis, it is not an indicator of whether a PNET is benign or malignant. The only criteria for malignant behavior are the presence of local invasion, metastases, or recurrent disease. </p><p>Earlier classification systems from the WHO had incorporated tumor size (&lt;2 cm, &ge;2 cm) into the staging criteria for sporadic PNET. There is evidence that larger tumors are more likely to be intermediate-grade rather than low-grade, and that larger tumors are more often malignant and have somewhat poorer outcomes with a higher risk of disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, size alone cannot determine malignant potential. Tumors &lt;2 cm can be malignant, and tumors &gt;2 cm can be benign. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18428100\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors can present at any age, they generally occur in older individuals. The peak incidence is between the fourth and sixth decades, and thus, medical risk assessment should be performed to identify and manage factors that increase the risk of perioperative adverse events.

Surgery is indicated in patients with PNETs to alleviate systemic symptoms due to hormone overproduction, compressive symptoms due to local mass effect, and to prevent malignant transformation or dissemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>For some small, PanNEN G1 asymptomatic tumors, active surveillance has emerged as a potentially safe and effective strategy in lieu of surgery. In a meta-analysis of five studies including 327 patients who were observed for asymptomatic small PNETs (although the definition of &quot;small&quot; ranged from 2 cm up to any size diameter), measurable tumor growth was observed in 0 to 51 percent of patients over a median follow-up period of 28 to 45 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Only 14 percent of patients ultimately required pancreatic resection (most commonly for tumor growth), and there were no disease-related deaths.</p><p>However, there is no consensus on which patient population is safe to observe. While the 2012 European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) guidelines endorsed intensive observation for nonfunctional PNETS &lt;2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], current guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15045\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a> recommended observing PNETS &lt;1 cm and excising those between 1 and 2 cm. Thus, until more conclusive data become available, the decision to pursue nonoperative management for small nonfunctional PNETs should be made individually after weighing risks against benefits. </p><p>Tumor functionality, grade, and stage are important factors in choosing patients for surgical treatment and determining the operative approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100577\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100577 \">algorithm 1</a>). As an example, for patients with a clinical syndrome consistent with insulinoma (most of which are benign), who appear to have an isolated pancreatic lesion, surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Patients with metastatic disease may be considered for debulking surgery if symptoms from excess insulin are refractory to medical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H7792276\" class=\"local\">'Insulinoma'</a> below.) </p><p>By contrast, the majority of glucagonomas, VIPomas, somatostatinomas, and gastrinomas are malignant. With malignant tumors, the primary consideration in determining surgical treatment is whether or not the patient has distant metastatic disease, whether or not the extrapancreatic disease is potentially resectable, and whether it is high-volume or low-volume. Aggressive resection of PNETs has acceptable morbidity and mortality with studies demonstrating improved survival across all stages of disease, supporting resection for patients with localized, locoregional, and even metastatic disease, as long as the metastatic sites can be completely resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/7,29,30,33-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,29,30,33-42</a>].

In some (but not all) series, this approach is associated with a modest survival benefit, but it is likely that this is the result of selection bias (ie, patients selected for this approach likely had a significantly lower tumor burden). (See <a href=\"#H14460032\" class=\"local\">'Nonfunctional'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In the absence of symptoms, there is little role for pancreatic resection for treating nonfunctioning tumors in the presence of extensive unresectable extrapancreatic disease. However, there may be a role for resection of the primary tumor in a patient with low-volume extrapancreatic metastatic disease, particularly with a primary involving the pancreatic head. Given the potentially long natural history of PNET, even when metastatic, tumors of the pancreatic head are more likely to result in symptoms (in contrast to those of the distal pancreas) by eroding into the duodenum, resulting in gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or may cause biliary or gastric outlet obstruction. Furthermore, as liver-directed therapies improve for treatment of liver-isolated metastatic disease, resection of the primary in the setting of unresectable liver-&quot;only&quot; disease should be strongly considered.

Perhaps one of the few relative contraindications based on anatomy is wide invasion of the celiac and superior mesenteric arterial axis. At times, surgery of the primary tumor site is beneficial to relieve symptoms. However, as discussed below, for patients with high-grade histology and rapidly progressive metastatic disease, best medical therapy is advised.

Cure is effected by resecting the primary tumor and associated lymph nodes while preserving the maximal amount of pancreatic mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/7,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,54</a>]. Preoperative selection and extent of surgery are based upon preoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraoperative localization of the tumor to reduce the risk of recurrence. For patients with nonlocalized lesions, a bilateral subcostal incision provides wider access to the entire pancreas, duodenum, and draining lymph node basins than a standard upper midline incision.

Exploration is aided by visual, manual, and ultrasonographic inspection. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) has become indispensable in localizing occult PNETs and for defining anatomic relationships. For enucleation procedures, intraoperative ultrasound is vital to ensuring a safe resection during enucleation and should be used to ascertain the relative location of the pancreatic duct and how much intervening pancreatic parenchyma lies between the tumor and duct. (See <a href=\"#H18431209\" class=\"local\">'Enucleation'</a> below.)</p><p>The Kocher maneuver is used to elevate the second portion of the duodenum out of the retroperitoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58768\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58768 \">figure 1</a>) to allow circumferential exploration of the pancreatic head and uncinate process. The neck, body, and tail of the pancreas can be explored by dividing the gastrocolic ligament to enter the lesser sac. The pancreas is elevated out of the retroperitoneum by dividing the inferior retroperitoneal attachments. </p><p>The ideal intraoperative probe for assessing the pancreas and its ductal system is a 12-MHz hockey stick probe (ie, pancreatic probe). Since the cord on the hockey stick probe comes off at a right angle to the active surface (unlike most probes where the cord comes off in line with the active surface), this configuration allows for a more ergonomic interrogation of the pancreas. For laparoscopic operations, a low-profile linear laparoscopic probe may be used. Saline may be instilled in the area to create a standoff (ie, increasing the distance between the probe and the pancreas to enhance the near field). A complete sonographic exploration of the liver for metastatic disease should also be performed using a liver-specific probe. Extrapancreatic sites including the duodenum, splenic hilum, small bowel, mesentery, and peripancreatic lymph nodes also must be explored. Through the meticulous combination of visual inspection, manual palpation, and IOUS, PNETs can be localized and defined, and the appropriate operation can be planned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18429702\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete surgical resection involves removing the primary tumor as well as any lymph node metastases that may be present, while preserving the maximal amount of pancreatic mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/7,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,54</a>].

Enucleation procedures included surgical pancreatic enucleation, transduodenal ampullary excision, and duodenal wall excision. Traditional resections included central pancreatectomy, distal pancreatectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and total pancreatectomy. Tumors that were enucleated were more likely to be functional tumors located in the head of the pancreas and less likely to result in splenectomy. The estimated overall morbidity and five-year survival were similar between the enucleation and resection groups. Although the rate of pancreatic fistula was significantly higher in the enucleation group, the fistulas tended to be less severe after enucleation than after resection. For patients with pancreatic head tumors, enucleation was associated with decreased blood loss, operative time, and length of hospital stay compared with pancreaticoduodenectomy.</p><p>Enucleation is more controversial for <strong>nonfunctional</strong> PNET smaller than 2 to 3 cm. Although traditional resection is preferred over enucleation for nonfunctional PNET smaller than 2 to 3 cm in size, enucleation is an option for a PanNEN G1 tumor. In one large multi-institutional review comparing enucleation with traditional resection, patients had a similar five-year survival, and although patients undergoing enucleation had a significant increased rate of pancreatic fistula, the severity of pancreatic fistula had tended toward a lower severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

There are descriptions and small series of minimally invasive approaches to most of the types of traditional pancreatic resections. These include laparoscopic and robotic techniques for everything from enucleation to pancreaticoduodenectomy. The location of the port sites or incision is based upon the location of the tumor.

Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation is an option for benign, small PNETs located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy can be performed with or without preservation of the spleen. Although central pancreatectomy has been performed laparoscopically, most reports describe an open approach.

A single-institution review evaluated 49 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic pancreatic surgery for PNETs, including 33 functional tumors and 16 nonfunctional tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Laparoscopic resections included 22 enucleations, 15 spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomies, and 8 open distal pancreatectomies with splenectomy. The estimated blood loss and operating times were lower in the laparoscopic enucleation group compared with the other laparoscopic groups, though overall complications, including pancreatic fistula, were higher in the laparoscopic enucleation group. The severity of fistula also was higher in the laparoscopic enucleation group. Overall morbidity was higher in the splenic preservation laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy group compared with laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. There were no differences in length of hospital stay between all the laparoscopic approaches. </p><p>Robotic surgery has also been used in the treatment of PNETs. In a propensity score matched retrospective study of 120 patients with small (&lt;2 cm) PNET, robotic enucleation was associated with less blood loss (33 versus 80 mL), a shorter duration of surgery (117 versus 150 minutes), and a shorter length of hospital stay (12 versus 13.5 days) compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The two groups had similar complication rates, including those of postoperative pancreatic fistula.

Bulky disease in the pancreatic head will likely produce significant symptoms. In general, if the tumor is relatively low-grade, and the metastatic tumor burden is not large, quality of life will be improved by resection of the primary. In addition, if the metastatic disease is isolated to the liver, resection of the primary combined with local liver-directed therapy may allow the patient to avoid long-term systemic therapy and its side effects. </p><p>In most (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]) series, removal of the primary tumor has been associated with longer survival, even in cases of unresectable metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/33,35,36,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35,36,77</a>].

Insulinoma can be sporadic or associated with MEN1 syndrome, which requires a different surgical approach. Sporadic insulinomas tend to be solitary lesions that respond well to limited resection, whereas MEN1-associated tumors are often multifocal and may require more extensive resections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Sporadic insulinomas are found with equal frequency in each of the sections of the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Although<strong> </strong>sporadic insulinomas are most often solitary, they can be multiple in 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and thus, it is necessary to confirm the lesion's location and rule out the presence of other tumors preoperatively, or intraoperatively with palpation and intraoperative ultrasound. It is often necessary to perform an extended Kocher maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58768\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58768 \">figure 1</a>) of the duodenum to the level of the superior mesenteric vein to allow bimanual palpation or intraoperative ultrasound of the entire head and uncinate process to plan either an anterior or posterior approach to the lesion. The size of the tumor and its location in relation to the common bile <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pancreatic duct determines whether the tumor can be enucleated or should be removed using a more traditional resection. Most insulinomas are located along the edges of the body or tail. (See <a href=\"#H352277422\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative localization'</a> above.)</p><p>If the tumor cannot be localized, blind distal pancreatectomy is no longer advocated. In the case of a nonlocalized tumor, postoperative selective arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous sampling should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. This test involves drawing hepatic venous samples after selective calcium infusion into the splenic, gastroduodenal, and superior mesenteric arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Enucleation can be attempted for small insulinomas (&lt;2 cm) that are not abutting the pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/16,26-28,30,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26-28,30,72</a>].

When the lesion is larger (&gt;2 cm) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> involves the common bile or pancreatic duct, or does not have a clear plane between the tumor capsule and pancreatic duct, a more traditional resection should be performed. Ten percent of insulinomas are malignant and demonstrate local infiltration of lymph nodes or liver metastases. Peripancreatic lymph node dissection should be performed in the rare patient with malignant insulinoma. In the presence of liver metastases, resection of the primary tumor and accessible metastases is advocated if it can be done safely. Tumor debulking helps reduce hypoglycemic symptoms and improves long-term survival. If a tumor is deemed unresectable, medications can be employed to minimize hypoglycemia and the progression of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>].

Although gastrinomas can have histologic features that appear benign and tend to be indolent in nature, most have malignant potential and can grow and metastasize. Early laparotomy and resection, even with incomplete resection of gastrinoma tissue, appears to favorably affect the natural history. In general, the cure rate for sporadic, nonmetastatic gastrinoma is 60 percent and 30 to 40 percent respectively at one and five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/12,72,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,72,87,88</a>]. </p><p>Gastrinomas may be single or multiple and are often duodenal (approximately two-thirds arise in the duodenal wall) or extrapancreatic in location. These tumors are typically found in the so-called &quot;gastrinoma triangle,&quot; which is delineated by the junction of the cystic and common bile duct, the junction of the second and third portion of duodenum, and the junction of the body and neck of the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. At surgery, a thorough exploration of the abdomen, including the liver, is required. The lesser sac should be opened, and bimanual palpation of the body and tail of the pancreas should be performed. A Kocher maneuver with inspection and palpation of the head of the pancreas and lymph nodes behind the uncinate process should also be performed. The surgeon should look and feel for small duodenal wall and submucosal tumors by performing a duodenotomy if necessary. The routine use of duodenotomy and intraoperative ultrasound has resulted in detection of gastrinoma in the majority of patients who are explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Multiple lymph node biopsies should be taken to obtain a tissue diagnosis.</p><p>The type and extent of resection depends on the location of the gastrinoma. Ideally, all gastrinoma tissue is resected. Regional lymphadenectomy should also be performed as required. Small gastrinomas (&lt;2 cm) in the head of the pancreas can be enucleated as these are likely to be benign, though larger tumors may require pancreaticoduodenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/8,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,90</a>].

Small tumors in the duodenal wall may be amenable to full-thickness excision and primary closure. With gastrinoma &gt;2 cm, there is a higher risk of malignancy and potential for nodal disease, and these should be removed via a traditional resection. Gastrinomas in the body or tail of the pancreas are best managed with a distal pancreatectomy. Although enucleation has been described for pancreatic tail lesions, traditional resection is preferred because of the more aggressive nature of gastrinoma to the left of the superior mesenteric vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. </p><p>The role of laparoscopy in the surgical management of gastrinomas is controversial. Open operations are still more commonly performed for gastrinoma because they usually are not localized preoperatively, are often located in the duodenum, and are commonly associated with lymph node metastases.

The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification recognizes three grades of well-differentiated PNETs: low (PanNET G1), intermediate (PanNET G2), or high-grade (PanNET G3); poorly differentiated, high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms are all referred to as PanNEC G3 tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 3</a>). We prefer the terms PNET G1, PNET G2, and PNET G3 to designate well-differentiated PNETs or varying grades and PNEC to designate a high-grade poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H13895677\" class=\"local\">'Staging and tumor classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with PNEC, surgery alone is rarely curative, even for patients with apparently localized disease. Nevertheless, resection may benefit selected patients when used in conjunction with chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy in a multimodality approach. Management of gastroenteropancreatic NECs is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H463614782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Localized disease'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While most PNETs are sporadic, PNETs can also be associated with genetic syndromes. The recommendations below refer to sporadic PNETs. The management of PNETs associated with genetic syndromes is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Management and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is the only curative modality for sporadic PNETs, and resection of the primary tumor in localized, regional, and even metastatic disease can improve patient survival. The goal of surgical resection of primary, sporadic PNETs is to completely remove the tumor for cure or, in appropriate cases, to debulk the tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100577\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100577 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus on whether it is safe to observe small (&lt;2 cm) nonfunctioning PNETs. While the 2012 European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) guidelines endorsed intensive observation for nonfunctional PNETS &lt;2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], current guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15045\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a> recommended observing PNETS &lt;1 cm and excising those between 1 and 2 cm. Until more conclusive data become available, the decision to pursue nonoperative management for small nonfunctional PNETs should be made individually after weighing risks against benefits. (See <a href=\"#H18427060\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important factors to consider when selecting the surgical approach to sporadic PNETs include functional status, benign or malignant nature, involvement with contiguous structures, presence of metastatic disease, and proliferative index. (See <a href=\"#H13895677\" class=\"local\">'Staging and tumor classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H352275447\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinical symptoms and biochemical evidence of hormone excess determine the tumor's functional status, classifying sporadic PNET as nonfunctional or functional (ie, insulinoma, gastrinoma, VIPoma, glucagonoma, or somatostatinoma). Up to one-half of sporadic PNETs have no defined clinical syndrome and no elevated hormone levels. In general, the aggressiveness of sporadic PNETs does not correlate with presence or type of hormone production. (See <a href=\"#H352275740\" class=\"local\">'Functionality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preoperative imaging by cross-sectional and functional imaging with or without endoscopic ultrasound can help localize the tumor and also determine the tumor's benign or malignant nature by determining the degree of local invasion, lymph node involvement, and metastases to the liver or elsewhere. The only reliable indicators of a malignant potential are the presence of invasion, metastases, or tumor recurrence. The majority of glucagonomas, VIPomas, somatostatinomas, and gastrinomas are malignant. Most nonfunctional, well-differentiated PNETs are also malignant. (See <a href=\"#H352275794\" class=\"local\">'Localization and malignant potential'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13895677\" class=\"local\">'Staging and tumor classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is indicated in patients with PNETs to alleviate systemic symptoms due to hormone overproduction, or compression due to local mass effect, and to prevent malignant transformation or dissemination. With malignant tumors, the primary consideration in determining surgical treatment is whether or not the patient has distant metastatic disease, whether or not the extrapancreatic disease is potentially resectable, whether metastatic disease is high-volume or low-volume, and the histology and growth rate. (See <a href=\"#H18427060\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with malignant, sporadic PNET and no evidence of distant metastatic spread of disease, exploratory laparotomy and resection with curative intent can be offered. The goal of curative resection is removal of the primary tumor and associated lymph nodes while preserving the maximal amount of pancreatic mass. Surgery for high-grade, poorly differentiated PNETs should be done in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation therapy in a multimodality approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with malignant, sporadic PNET and potentially resectable metastatic disease, an aggressive resection of the primary and metastatic sites can offer the potential for long-term survival. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with unresectable, metastatic disease, best medical therapy including long-acting somatostatin analogues is the usual first-line approach. In some cases, surgery may be pursued even if complete resection cannot be accomplished. The decision to pursue surgery is a complex one and needs to take into account tumor histology, the volume of metastatic disease, and the growth rate:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with low-volume metastatic well-differentiated low-grade tumors (ie, PanNEN G1), resection of metastatic sites in conjunction with adjuvant therapies such as ablation, embolization, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy can prolong and improve the quality of life. Even large tumors can be debulked with the expectation that adjunctive treatment will be used to control unresectable residual disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Local options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with well-differentiated tumors with high-volume metastatic disease and a rapid growth rate, best medical therapy may include hormone therapy, long-acting somatostatin analogues, or chemotherapy. However, even in the presence of metastatic disease, palliative debulking may still be indicated for relief of systemic or local symptoms related to hormone production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-well-differentiated-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-systemic-therapy-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Systemic therapy options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether or not there is a benefit to resection of a primary, nonfunctional PNET in patients with unresectable metastatic disease is debated. In some (but not all) series, this approach is associated with a modest survival benefit, but it is likely that this is the result of selection bias (ie, patients selected for this approach likely had a significantly lower tumor burden). In our view, this decision must be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H18427060\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for resection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14460032\" class=\"local\">'Nonfunctional'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the PNET is not successfully localized on preoperative imaging, intraoperative localization includes visual and manual inspection of the pancreas and intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS), which can also be used during the course of the procedure to ensure a safe resection. Extrapancreatic sites should also be explored. (See <a href=\"#H352277422\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative localization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional pancreatic resection (eg, pancreaticoduodenectomy, pancreatic tail resection) and pancreas-sparing resections (enucleation, central pancreatectomy) are used to treat PNETs, depending on the location of the tumor. Parenchyma-sparing operations are generally safe and effective for the management of small PNETs; however, even small PNETs may have lymph node disease and require traditional resection. Enucleation may be attempted for insulinoma and gastrinoma &lt;2 cm that are not abutting the pancreatic duct, as these are likely to be benign. For some patients with significant comorbidities who may not withstand traditional resection, enucleation may also be appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H22377303\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Re-resection should be considered in patients with evidence of tumor recurrence on postoperative surveillance. Postoperative surveillance typically includes cross-sectional imaging and serial chromogranin A levels, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> scanning, if a new lesion is identified. (See <a href=\"#H18426593\" class=\"local\">'Re-resection'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-sporadic-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Halfdanarson TR, Rabe KG, Rubin J, Petersen GM.
