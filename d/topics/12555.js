However, only 3 to 6 percent of smokers who make an unaided quit attempt are still abstinent one year later. Fewer than one-third of adult smokers who try to quit seek help, and even fewer use the most effective treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. With optimal treatment, 25 to 35 percent of smokers who try to quit can succeed for six months or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23644659\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF USE AND EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend that clinicians ask all patients about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This practice has been shown to increase the likelihood of smoking-related discussions and increase smoking cessation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>For patients who use tobacco, a full assessment includes the frequency of use, the products used, the degree of nicotine dependence, the history of previous quit attempts (including methods used and their effectiveness), and the readiness to stop smoking at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Dependence on nicotine can be estimated from the age of smoking initiation, the number of cigarettes smoked daily, and how soon after waking up the smoker has his or her first morning cigarette. A smoker's degree of nicotine dependence predicts the difficulty that he or she will have in quitting and the intensity of treatment likely to be required. More dependent smokers started smoking early in life, smoke more cigarettes daily, and smoke within the first 30 minutes of awakening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>It is important to ask a patient if he or she <strong>ever</strong> smokes cigarettes, because non-daily or intermittent smokers may not identify themselves as smokers when questioned. It also important to assess the full extent of tobacco and nicotine use by asking about other tobacco products (eg, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, water <span class=\"nowrap\">pipes/hookahs,</span> and bidis) and electronic cigarettes. More than 40 percent of tobacco users consume more than one type of tobacco product, and almost one-quarter of people who consume tobacco use both cigarettes and e-cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Often, these alternative tobacco products are incorrectly perceived as having less health risk to the user. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals who do not use tobacco products should be asked about exposure to smoke (in the home, car, or workplace), as secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer in nonsmokers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84078137\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVISE SMOKING CESSATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not every patient counseled in smoking cessation will be prepared to consider quitting, there is clear evidence that brief clinician advice interventions to quit (&lt;five minutes) at each encounter can increase smoking abstinence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A 2013 systematic review of 42 trials with over 31,000 smokers concluded that simple advice to quit has a small effect on cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Assuming a baseline unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3 percent, a brief advice intervention could increase quitting by a further 1 to 3 percent. The main therapeutic effect of clinician advice is likely to promote motivation to quit. Even if they are not ready to quit, smokers who are asked about their tobacco use or are advised to quit smoking report being more satisfied with their care than patients who do not receive such advice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The systematic review concluded that there was a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared with brief interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the efficacy of providing physiologic feedback to a smoker to demonstrate the negative effects of smoking on their health is uncertain. As an example, in one randomized trial of 100 smokers, those who were provided the results of testing for salivary nicotine metabolite levels had increased short-term quit rates compared with those who received counselling alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In another randomized trial, telling smokers their &quot;lung age&quot; based on pulmonary function testing improved the likelihood of them quitting smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There is little evidence that other types of biomedical risk assessment increase smoking cessation rates compared with standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Studies have not found efficacy for these approaches; more evidence is needed before they can be routinely recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily has been advocated as a possible alternative to complete cessation in patients who are unable to quit smoking. However, few data are available that support a reduction in smoking as the goal of treatment, compared with complete cessation. Complete smoking cessation is always preferable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H99356499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Questionable utility of smoking reduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84078260\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESS READINESS TO QUIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following advice, the clinician should assess the patient's willingness to make a quit attempt. Smokers differ in their readiness to change their tobacco use. Understanding the smokers' perspectives is essential to providing useful assistance.</p><p>The Stages of Change Model was developed to describe the process by which behavior change occurs. It identifies five stages through which smokers are hypothesized to progress as they move from smoking to abstinence: pre-contemplation (not ready to quit), contemplation (considering a quit attempt), preparation (actively planning a quit attempt), action (actively involved in a quit attempt), and maintenance (achieved smoking cessation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The validity of this model has been debated, with some critics noting that individuals do not move through predictable stages of behavior change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A 2010 systematic review of 41 trials concluded that stage-based help-interventions were equivalent to their non-stage-based equivalents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nonetheless, the basic concept of change being gradual is a useful construct for clinicians when discussing smoking cessation with a smoker.</p><p>An alternate approach is to proactively offer treatment rather than assessing for readiness to quit. This is consistent with the concept that tobacco use represents a chronic disease which should be approached like other chronic diseases that clinicians manage. In this approach, the clinician proactively offers treatment, rather than assessing readiness to quit. For example, &quot;Quitting smoking can be hard, but effective treatment is available and I can help you. Would you like to try?&quot; Clinical trials have not tested this approach. However, randomized trials of proactive outreach programs that offer smoking cessation interventions to smokers have been shown to increase smoking cessation rates (compared with usual care) in veterans and patients of low-socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H696295644\" class=\"local\">'Implementation in primary care practice'</a> below.)</p><p>Proponents of this approach argue that clinicians do not ask patients with diabetes or hypertension if they want treatment; rather, clinicians offer treatment of these chronic diseases. By analogy, offering a smoker treatment in a positive way is hypothesized to increase the likelihood that a smoker will use treatment. The management of tobacco dependence has similarities to the management of other chronic conditions requiring long-term follow-up to achieve permanent abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84078423\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSIST SMOKERS READY TO QUIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a smoker is motivated to quit, clinicians should help the smoker to have access to appropriate resources to assist in smoking cessation. The clinician should assess the smoker's previous experiences with attempts to quit. Assessing the methods that have been tried and the smoker's degree of success with each is important in order to guide recommendations for the next attempt. Clinicians should also help the patient anticipate barriers to quitting and address barriers. Several practical steps in assisting a patient to stop smoking are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52690 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1124334982\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting a quit date</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of smoking cessation generally begins by setting a &quot;quit day&quot; within the next two to four weeks. Patients should be directed to stop smoking completely on their quit day and should be prepared to handle nicotine withdrawal symptoms and other barriers to quitting. Depending on the medication chosen, pharmacotherapy is started either before or on the quit date. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence suggests that patients can be given the choice to reduce smoking prior to a quit date or to stop smoking abruptly on the quit date (as has been the traditional teaching) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a systematic review of 10 randomized trials, there was no difference in abstinence rates between those who reduced smoking before the quit date and those who quit abruptly (relative risk [RR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.79-1.13), regardless of whether behavioral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacologic treatments were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, subsequent studies have suggested that among smokers who plan to quit in the near future, quit rates are higher for patients who stop abruptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. A randomized trial in 697 smokers in England found that gradual smoking cessation (decreasing by 75 percent in the two weeks prior to quitting) was associated with decreased likelihood of abstinence at four weeks when compared with abrupt smoking cessation (39 versus 49 percent, RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.66-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83022898\"><span class=\"h2\">Addressing barriers to quit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors account for the difficulty that smokers encounter when they try to quit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83022810\"><span class=\"h3\">Nicotine withdrawal syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addictiveness of nicotine is the primary barrier for smokers to quit. Nicotine is a potent psychoactive drug that causes physical dependence and tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the absence of nicotine, a smoker develops cravings for cigarettes and symptoms of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Symptoms peak in the first three days of smoking cessation and subside over the next three to four weeks. Symptoms include increased appetite and weight gain, changes in mood (dysphoria or depression), insomnia, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and restlessness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H30936459\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Nicotine withdrawal syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Nicotine withdrawal symptoms should be discussed so that smokers will know what to expect and how to respond if these symptoms occur. These symptoms can be alleviated by any of the first-line smoking cessation medications (nicotine replacement, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>). Behavioral approaches can also be used, though most often smokers use pharmacotherapy to relieve nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

All smokers should be told that the clinician is willing to help to work through any obstacles and that effective treatments are available.</p><p>Smokers become conditioned to associate the pleasurable effects of tobacco use with environmental triggers such as their morning coffee, an alcoholic drink, or the end of a meal. These triggers contribute to the difficulty smokers have in remaining abstinent from nicotine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Practical counseling can help smokers deal with these situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52690 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other barriers to quitting include the possibilities of weight gain and depression.

Smokers usually feel discouraged and the clinician can help the patient to interpret what is perceived as failure into a partial success by calling attention to small positive steps such as the number of hours that the smoker was able to refrain from smoking and framing it as a first step toward success. The clinician can help the patient work through any problems that are identified and explore solutions for the next quit attempt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54759 \">table 3</a>). Patients may be highly dependent upon nicotine, have low self-confidence or little social support for quitting, have comorbid psychiatric illness, or have not used medications correctly, all of which should be addressed with the patient before setting another quit date. The clinician should also determine the patient's own insight into the possible reasons why the attempt failed, most importantly how the patient is able to cope with withdrawal symptoms. Smokers who fail to quit on an adequate trial of first-line pharmacotherapy may benefit from second-line pharmacotherapy. We also attempt to intensify behavioral counseling.

However, long-term follow-up is recommended because successful quitters remain at high risk of relapse for several years after smoking cessation.

There is little evidence of harm from a longer duration of treatment with these medications, although the optimal duration has not been established. Ideally, we continue pharmacotherapy until patients feel confident that they will not relapse. This can be difficult, as most insurance companies do not cover smoking cessation medications after three months of pharmacotherapy.</p><p>By contrast, there is relatively little evidence that long-term use of specific behavioral interventions prevent relapse after smoking cessation is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. A 2013 systematic review of 63 studies evaluating interventions for relapse prevention found that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific behavioral intervention to help smokers avoid relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, it is reasonable to use simple interventions that promote abstinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54759 \">table 3</a>). The benefits of smoking cessation can be highlighted by simply asking how their lives have changed since they stopped smoking.

For patients who relapse, we attempt to provide or intensify the behavioral counseling. This can consist of referral to a quitline that provides proactive smoking cessation counseling over several calls. This free service is accessible nationwide in the United States by calling 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Alternatively, a patient can be referred to a formal in-person smoking cessation counseling program, if one is available locally. Referral for additional behavioral support is advised for the smoker who is heavily dependent upon nicotine or has had multiple unsuccessful attempts. Involving different types of providers (eg, physicians, nurses, psychologists, dentists) through a multidisciplinary program can improve smoking cessation rates.</p><p>If a previous medication was helpful temporarily, we typically recommend the same therapy that worked for the patient previously.

Most smokers have a general desire to stop smoking, but may not be ready to take specific action to quit, for a variety of reasons. Asking a smoker what he or she likes and does not like about smoking is a way to start. A personalized message concerning a smoking-related health problem may motivate some patients into action.</p><p>Clinicians can use motivational interviewing techniques to explore a smoker's feelings, beliefs, ideas, and values regarding tobacco use.

In this model, office staff members take on the responsibility for assessing each patient's smoking status and reminding the clinician to address smoking when identified.

In the United States, this can be supplemented by referring smokers for free telephone counseling (1-800-QUIT-NOW). The quitline automatically links smokers to the resources available in their state.</p><p>In many US states, the clinician's office can directly refer to the quitline by sending a referral by fax or electronically.

(See <a href=\"#H84078137\" class=\"local\">'Advise smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For smokers who are willing to quit, we recommend that smokers be managed with a combination of behavioral support and pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Combination therapy is superior to either behavioral intervention or pharmacologic therapy alone. (See <a href=\"#H1124333662\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that the maximal behavioral intervention acceptable to the patient be used. Behavioral intervention can consist of brief clinician counseling in the office, but smokers should also be referred to a free telephone quitline for continued counseling support. In the United States, this can be accessed through a national toll-free number (1-800-QUIT-NOW). (See <a href=\"#H1124333662\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With a few exceptions, choice of medication is generally based on patient preference after discussion with a clinician.

We also attempt to intensify behavioral counseling.

Enhancing treatment by adding another pharmacologic agent or more intensive behavioral support can also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H1124332628\" class=\"local\">'Relapse'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults#H2647690331\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;, section on 'Relapse'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For smokers who are not ready to quit, the clinician's role is to assess the patient's perspective about the risks and benefits of continuing to smoke in order to help the smoker to begin to think about quitting. Smokers can also be advised about the health risks of secondhand smoke exposure to their household members and urged to commit to keeping their home and car smoke-free, especially if children are present. Clinicians can use motivational interviewing techniques for smokers not ready to quit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation#H99358233\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Patients not ready to quit'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implementing smoking cessation strategies can be difficult in a busy primary care practice. A team-based 5 A&rsquo;s approach or proactively offering treatment are strategies a busy clinician can use to offer smoking cessation to patients.
