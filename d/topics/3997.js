Secondary renal neoplasms are usually clinically insignificant and discovered at postmortem examination.</p><p>Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), which originate within the renal cortex, constitute 80 to 85 percent of primary renal neoplasms. Transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis are the next most common (approximately 8 percent). Other parenchymal epithelial tumors, such as oncocytomas, collecting duct tumors, and renal sarcomas, are rare. Nephroblastoma or Wilms tumor is common in children (5 to 6 percent of all primary renal tumors). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical and radiographic presentation of RCC and the methods used for tumor staging, as well as their potential application for screening, will be reviewed here. The prognosis and treatment of RCC are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can present with a range of symptoms; unfortunately, many patients are asymptomatic until the disease is advanced. At presentation, approximately 25 percent of individuals either have distant metastases or advanced locoregional disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients with localized disease can present with a wide array of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory abnormalities, or they may be diagnosed incidentally. In a 1971 review of 309 consecutive patients with RCC, the most common presenting symptoms were hematuria, abdominal mass, pain, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contemporary series, fewer patients have the typical symptoms and there is an increased frequency of incidental diagnosis due to radiologic procedures performed for other indications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H175757290\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This shift in pattern of presentation along with improvements in therapy may have contributed to better outcomes in RCC. In a series of 701 patients, those who were diagnosed incidentally had a significantly better disease-specific survival at five years (76 versus 44 percent in those with symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Multivariate analysis showed that the difference was due to the lower stage and histologic grade at the time of diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients not diagnosed incidentally, symptoms and signs are generally related to invasion of adjacent structures or distant metastases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic triad of RCC (flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable abdominal renal mass) occurs in at most 9 percent of patients; when present, it strongly suggests locally advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria is observed only with tumor invasion of the collecting system. In an early series, hematuria was observed in almost 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When severe, the bleeding can cause clots and &quot;colicky&quot; discomfort. Clot formation does not occur with glomerular bleeding; thus, the presence of clots is a significant finding in patients with otherwise unexplained hematuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H1824471590\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Blood clots'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abdominal or flank mass, which is associated with lower pole tumors, is more commonly palpated in the thin adult.

Varicoceles typically fail to empty when the patient is recumbent. This finding should always arouse suspicion for a kidney tumor that has obstructed the gonadal vein where it enters the renal vein. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior vena cava involvement can produce a variety of clinical manifestations, including lower extremity edema, ascites, hepatic dysfunction (possibly related to a Budd-Chiari syndrome), and pulmonary emboli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with disseminated disease, signs or symptoms may be due to metastatic tumor; the most common sites of involvement include the lungs, lymph nodes, bone, liver, and brain. In this setting, the diagnosis is often made either by biopsy of an accessible metastasis or by finding a renal mass on abdominal computed tomography (CT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance for metastatic disease after definitive treatment for renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Sites of metastasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with RCC can present with or subsequently develop systemic symptoms or paraneoplastic syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In some instances, these may be due to ectopic production of various hormones (eg, erythropoietin, parathyroid hormone-related protein [PTHrP], gonadotropins, human chorionic somatomammotropin, an adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]-like substance, renin, glucagon, insulin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia, which can precede the diagnosis of RCC by several months, has been reported in 29 to 88 percent of patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-11</a>]. The anemia is often disproportionately severe, can be either normocytic or microcytic, and is frequently associated with iron studies typical of those observed with the anemia of chronic disease.

The dysfunction may result from tumor production of cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and possibly interleukin (IL)-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Nephrectomy may result in the amelioration of hepatic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

In addition, incidental diagnosis of RCC is becoming more common due to the frequent use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasonography for evaluation of an unrelated problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual first test is abdominal CT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60352\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60352 \">image 1</a>) or, occasionally, abdominal ultrasound. </p><p>Although ultrasonography is less sensitive than CT in detecting a renal mass, it is useful to distinguish a simple benign cyst from a more complex cyst or a solid tumor. The issues surrounding the evaluation of an asymptomatic renal mass or a cyst are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and complex renal cysts in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Summarized briefly, there are three major criteria that allow a simple cyst to be differentiated from a tumor or abscess on ultrasonography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67087 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cyst is round and sharply demarcated with smooth walls</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no echoes within the cyst (&quot;anechoic&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a strong posterior wall echo, indicating good transmission through a cyst</p><p/><p>If all of these criteria are fulfilled, no further evaluation is necessary since the likelihood of a malignancy is extremely small. If the criteria for a simple cyst by ultrasonography are not satisfied, the patient should undergo CT scanning before and after injection of iodinated contrast. On CT, a simple cyst has a smooth appearance without a clearly delineated wall, has no enhancement with intravascular contrast, and is the density of water. CT urography allows imaging of both the renal parenchyma and the collecting system.</p><p>By comparison, thickened irregular walls or septa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77721\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77721 \">image 2</a>) and enhancement after contrast injection are suggestive of malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67087 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and complex renal cysts in adults&quot;, section on 'Bosniak classification of renal cysts'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful when ultrasonography and CT are nondiagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic contrast cannot be administered because of allergy or poor renal function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73120%7EONC%2F51129\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73120 graphicRef51129 \">image 3A-B</a>). MRI may be particularly valuable if a tumor is present to identify the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extent of involvement of the collecting system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inferior vena cava.

After the presumptive diagnosis has been made based upon imaging studies, the patient must be evaluated for the extent of local involvement and the presence of metastatic disease prior to surgery.</p><p>The role of percutaneous biopsy is more limited, although it may be used for a small renal mass if there is a high index of suspicion for a metastatic lesion to the kidney, lymphoma, or a focal kidney infection. A biopsy can also be used to confirm a diagnosis of RCC in patients who are not surgical candidates prior to initiating appropriate medical treatment, although biopsy of a metastatic lesion is often preferable.

Although PET or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may be more sensitive than radionuclide scanning for the detection of bone metastases, it is expensive and has limited use for routine staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p/><p>Although solid renal masses less than 3 cm were once thought to represent benign adenomas, distinctions based upon size are no longer used, since even small tumors frequently represent carcinomas that will grow over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Most solid renal masses require a histologic diagnosis; in patients with significant comorbidities, &quot;watchful waiting&quot; might be appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and complex renal cysts in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to establishing the diagnosis of malignancy, tissue diagnosis provides information about the histopathologic type of RCC, which may have important implications for prognosis and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with isolated solid renal masses, resection with either a partial or complete nephrectomy is preferred over biopsy because it provides both the diagnosis and definitive treatment. Preoperative needle biopsies are usually not used for resectable renal lesions because of their low specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and concerns about tumor seeding of the peritoneum.</p><p>When metastatic disease is suspected at initial presentation, pathologic confirmation is required prior to starting therapy. Biopsy of a metastatic site is often easier and more informative than biopsy of the primary tumor. </p><p>The advent of effective targeted and antiangiogenic therapies has prompted an ongoing reassessment of the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy in patients with clear cell RCC. This reassessment will likely influence decisions regarding preoperative biopsy, but for now, cytoreductive nephrectomy is typically recommended in patients with intermediate prognostic features, where the majority of the tumor burden is confined to the primary kidney mass.</p><p>In the setting of a patient with a previously diagnosed nonrenal malignancy, metastatic disease is more likely than a new primary RCC. If the renal mass is nonenhancing and there is clinical evidence of progression of the nonrenal malignancy, biopsy confirmation may be unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">TNM STAGING SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eighth (2017) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is used for staging all histologic variants of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This system is supported by both the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union for Cancer Control (UICC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These TNM criteria use the anatomic extent of disease to define prognostic stage groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The TNM system is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110735 \">table 2</a>). In this system, tumors limited to the kidney are classified as T1 or T2 based upon size. T3 tumors extend into the renal vein or perinephric tissues but not beyond the Gerota fascia, while T4 tumors extend beyond the Gerota fascia, including direct extension into the ipsilateral adrenal gland. Nodal and distant metastases are simply classified as absent or present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SOLID RENAL MASSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal management of solid renal parenchymal masses is incompletely understood and relies upon both the ability of imaging studies to identify simple renal cysts and the likelihood of the lesion to exhibit clinically malignant behavior.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with symptoms, signs, or other findings suggestive of RCC should undergo evaluation for the presence of a renal mass.
