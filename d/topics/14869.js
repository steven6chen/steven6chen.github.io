It causes pain and swelling in joints.</p><p>Reactive arthritis usually affects people who have or just had:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food poisoning or another kind of infection of the intestines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection that you catch through sex </p><p/><p>In the past, reactive arthritis was sometimes called &quot;Reiter syndrome.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18611485\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of reactive arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms of reactive arthritis are pain and swelling in the joints. These usually happen 1 to 4 weeks after an infection. In most cases, the symptoms affect only a few joints, usually in the knees, ankles, or feet.</p><p>Other symptoms might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the tendons in the feet and ankles (tendons are tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritation of the eye called &quot;conjunctivitis&quot; (also known as pink eye)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when urinating</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18611500\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for reactive arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But if your doctor or nurse can figure out what type of germ caused your infection, he or she should be able to tell if you have reactive arthritis. Your doctor or nurse can test your stool (bowel movements) or urine to look for certain kinds of germs.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse can't tell what germs caused your infection, he or she will study your symptoms to decide how likely it is that you have reactive arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18611515\"><span class=\"h1\">How is reactive arthritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of reactive arthritis are treated with medicines, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs &ndash; This is a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). Your doctor or nurse might prescribe a dose higher than you would normally take to relieve pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines &ndash; If NSAIDs do not help your symptoms, your doctor or nurse might give you a shot of steroids. Steroids help reduce inflammation. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. Your doctor might also give you more steroids to take at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are also other medicines that might help if your symptoms do not get better with NSAIDs or steroids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye drops &ndash; Special drops can help relieve redness and irritation in your eyes. But if you have eye pain or trouble seeing, visit an eye doctor to make sure you don't have a more serious problem.</p><p/><p>Antibiotics do not usually help with the joint symptoms of reactive arthritis. Even so, your doctor or nurse might prescribe them if you still have an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18611530\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with reactive arthritis get better quickly. Some people continue to notice symptoms, either constantly or just once in a while.</p><p>If your back gets very stiff and sore, see your doctor or nurse. This might mean that your reactive arthritis has turned into a more serious problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18611545\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankylosing-spondylitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ankylosing spondylitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reactive arthritis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=axial-spondyloarthritis-including-ankylosing-spondylitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
