We believe the hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula should be examined at every hemodialysis treatment. This requires that all clinical staff who are directly involved in the care of hemodialysis patients be familiar with the basic techniques used to examine the fistula. Routine systematic physical examination of the fistula by the dialysis staff with each treatment may allow early detection of problems that are commonly associated with mature fistula, thus avoiding missed treatments and emergent situations. (See <a href=\"#H304583510\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy of physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical monitoring and surveillance of the mature hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H182032180\" class=\"local\">'Examination to detect specific problems'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182032187\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the patient with a hemodialysis access includes inspection of the fistula itself as well as inspection of the entire extremity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304583016\"><span class=\"h3\">Fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in a systematic evaluation of the mature AV fistula is to examine the integrity of the skin overlying the fistula, which should appear normal without erythema, focal masses, or focal swelling. Cannulation sites should be well healed with minimal to no scabbing and no evidence of inflammation. There should be no aneurysms (localized bulging zone) present. If an aneurysm is present, the skin overlying the bulging area should be examined for evidence of depigmentation, thinning, ulceration, or spontaneous bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H30162262\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysms'</a> below.)</p><p>In the patient with a normal hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula, the fistula is generally distended somewhat when the patient's fistula arm is dependent due to the effects of gravity. If the arm is elevated to a level above that of the heart, the normal AV fistula will collapse. Even if the patient has a large &quot;mega-fistula,&quot; it will at least become flaccid. However, if a venous stenosis is present, that portion of the AV fistula distal to the lesion will remain distended while the proximal portion collapses. If the entire fistula collapses when the patient's arm is elevated, one can conclude that the outflow of the fistula is normal. (See <a href=\"#H30162232\" class=\"local\">'Stenotic vascular lesions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304583033\"><span class=\"h3\">Extremity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hand ipsilateral to the AV fistula should be compared with the contralateral, presumably normal, hand and should be normal in appearance without evidence for ischemia (ie, cool, pale). The extremity should also be examined along its length up to the shoulder for any evidence of venous collateralization over the chest or shoulder that might suggest central venous outflow obstruction. There should be no edema of the extremity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304582940\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula should be soft and compressible, and palpation should not elicit any pain. The skin overlying a flowing fistula may be warm to the touch. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182032318\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulse in the fistula may be best appreciated using the fingers (not the palm or thumb) and should be evaluated along the length of the fistula from the arteriovenous anastomosis through the venous outflow. The extremity pulses should also be evaluated. In general, very little pulse should be detected with palpation of the fistula. When the normal fistula is occluded a short distance from the arteriovenous anastomosis, the arterial pulse at the wrist should be increased or augmented. The degree of this augmentation is directly proportional to the quality of the arterial inflow. It is very useful to develop the practice of grading pulse augmentation (scale of 0 to 10, or alternatively 0 [absent], 1 [diminished], 2 [normal], 3 [aneurysmal]). With routine practice, one will quickly begin to recognize what is normal. The pulse below the fistula (ie, radial or ulnar below a Cimino-type, brachial below an upper arm fistula) is generally palpable. However, physiologic steal is common, but most patients do not have symptoms of significant hand ischemia (ie, ischemic steal syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H30162277\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis ischemic steal syndrome'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304583105\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrill</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thrill is a palpable vibration over the fistula that is related to flow. Thrills are best evaluated using the palm of the hand, rather than the fingers. The normal hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula is characterized by a soft, continuous, diffuse thrill that is palpable over the course of the fistula and most prominent over the arteriovenous anastomosis. It should have both a systolic and diastolic component. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304583156\"><span class=\"h3\">Direction of flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The direction of blood flow should be determined and documented prior to starting dialysis for each patient in the dialysis facility. Although the direction of flow is generally obvious, there are some fistulas that have bidirectional flow. The frequency with which fistulas with bidirectional flow are seen varies with the surgical practice within the community. </p><p>The direction of flow can be easily determined by occluding the fistula with the tip of the finger and palpating on each side of the occlusion point for a pulse. The side without a pulse is the downstream (ie, in the direction of flow) side. The distal extremity pulse should increase in intensity during the occlusion (ie, augmentation). While determining the direction of flow in this manner is easier to accomplish when the patient is not on dialysis, the examination can also generally be adequately performed with needles in place, provided they are not placed too closely together. When the fistula is occluded between the two needles during dialysis, very little or no change is observed in either the venous or arterial pressure readings. Any differences may indicate the presence of fistula recirculation. (See <a href=\"#H304584193\" class=\"local\">'Testing for recirculation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304582983\"><span class=\"h2\">Auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auscultation of the hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula can be performed using a stethoscope or with a handheld continuous wave Doppler. One advantage of using Doppler is the ability to hear very low flow that distinguishes between a fistula that has a severe stenosis versus one that is completely occluded. (See <a href=\"#H30162232\" class=\"local\">'Stenotic vascular lesions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16358064\" class=\"local\">'Thrombosed fistula'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182032312\"><span class=\"h3\">Bruit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bruit is the auditory manifestation of a thrill, often referred to as a &quot;buzz.&quot; A bruit is characterized by both the auditory frequency (pitch) and the duration. The bruit has the same significance as the thrill. The bruit over a well-functioning fistula has a low-pitched, soft, machinery-like rumbling sound and, like the thrill, has both a systolic and diastolic component. The bruit is also more accentuated at the arterial anastomosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182032180\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION TO DETECT SPECIFIC PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common complications associated with a mature hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula are stenotic vascular lesions (venous stenosis, arterial stenosis), fistula thrombosis, infection, aneurysm, and extremity ischemia. Physical examination of a mature fistula should be systematically directed toward the detection of these potential problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30162232\"><span class=\"h2\">Stenotic vascular lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stenosis is the most common complication affecting the hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula. Stenosis may occur anywhere along the hemodialysis vascular circuit (ie, the arterial side, the fistula itself, or venous side). The proximal upper extremity arterial and central venous stenoses are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The fistula should be routinely evaluated to detect any stenotic vascular lesions. Physical examination of the fistula itself may identify the specific site of the problem. When evaluating the pulse, thrill, or bruit, one has to be careful not to create artifact by compressing the fistula with the examining hand or fingers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304584249\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical findings</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous stenosis &ndash; Physical findings suggestive of venous stenosis include persistent arm swelling, prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal, and the presence of collateral veins. If the arm is elevated to a level above that of the heart and the fistula does not collapse completely as it normally should, one can conclude that the outflow of the fistula is abnormal. When a venous stenosis is present, that portion of the fistula distal to the lesion will remain distended while the proximal portion collapses. In addition, alterations of the pulse, thrill, or bruit may also suggest stenosis. The presence of a strong pulse in the fistula suggests that there is an increase in downstream (ie, in the direction of flow) resistance, as occurs with a venous stenotic lesion. The intensity of this pulse is directly proportional to the severity of the stenosis. For this reason, a strong pulse in a fistula should be considered an adverse finding. A localized, accentuated thrill may be detected over an area of turbulent flow within the fistula or its drainage and suggests a stenotic lesion and, thus, should be considered an abnormal finding. A thrill that is associated with a stenotic fistula may not have a diastolic component compared with that associated with a normal fistula. Increasing resistance from a stenotic lesion results in progressively higher pitch to the bruit and, as with the thrill, progressive loss of the diastolic component. With severe downstream stenosis, the bruit may become a high-pitched, almost whistling sound that is heard only during systole. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial stenosis &ndash; Reduced pulse augmentation suggests inflow (arterial) stenosis (see <a href=\"#H182032318\" class=\"local\">'Pulse'</a> above). The stenosis may be located in the juxta-anastomotic region, the anastomosis, or the feeding artery. It is not possible to distinguish between these alternatives by physical examination unless there is a significant proximal arterial stenosis causing a discrepancy in the upper extremity pressures. Pulse augmentation may be revealing even when it is performed in the presence of a venous stenosis (ie, when the pulse within the fistula is hyperpulsatile). If a hyperpulsatile fistula does not augment with occlusion, it suggests that the inflow stenosis is essentially a complete obstruction. If the degree of augmentation is less than expected, then the degree of suggested stenosis is of a comparable degree of stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous stenosis &ndash; The physical findings among patients with significant central venous stenosis may differ from those that have been described for venous stenosis in peripheral veins. The classic physical finding in a patient with a significant central venous stenosis is ipsilateral arm edema, which can be massive. Subcutaneous collateral veins are frequently evident over the arm and chest. Swelling and collateral veins are caused by generalized venous hypertension of the arm, which occurs in central, but not peripheral, stenosis. Not all central venous lesions are hemodynamically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. However, swelling of the hand or arm, even if not massive, or the development of chest wall collaterals suggest clinically significant central venous lesions. The pulsation over the fistula is not as strong as it generally is among patients with peripheral venous stenosis. This is because the pulse is dampened by the elasticity of the veins that are between the fistula and the area of stenosis. The greater the distance between the fistula and the stenosis, the more the pulse is attenuated, and the distance is the longest among patients with a central stenosis. Often, especially in thin-chested individuals with a subclavian lesion, a localized thrill can be felt over the anterior chest, just below the clavicle, and a localized bruit is frequently evident. Patients with such manifestations should be further investigated. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304584193\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing for recirculation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of recirculation is the presence of high-grade venous stenoses leading to backflow into the arterial needle. Moderate-to-severe recirculation may be detected by physical examination. Other methods to detect recirculation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-recirculation-in-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula recirculation in hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To test for recirculation on physical examination, the examiner should occlude the fistula between the two needles during dialysis and observe the venous and arterial pressure gauges. If the needles have been placed too closely together, this examination will not be possible. A hard object such as a closed hemostat occludes the fistula more efficiently than a finger. With a normal fistula, very little or no change is observed in either the venous or arterial pressure readings. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If recirculation is secondary to outflow obstruction (venous stenosis), the pressure will increase in the venous return because the lower-resistance recirculation route has been occluded. As pressure limits are exceeded, the alarm will sound, and the blood pump will quickly stop. The arterial pressure may become slightly more negative as the pressure head generated by the venous side is no longer transmitted through the occluded site in the fistula. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If recirculation is due to poor inflow (arterial stenosis or insufficiency), the occlusion will cause a decrease in pressure since the blood pump will demand more blood than is available (since the recirculation route will have been occluded). In this instance, the arterial alarm will sound very quickly, but the venous pressure may change very little. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16358064\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombosed fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike the typical clinical scenario associated with thrombosed arteriovenous (AV) grafts, which often clot abruptly, hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) fistulas tolerate much lower blood flow rates without clotting, allowing the lesion longer to progress and become more severe than is typically seen with AV graft thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result, an AV fistula can develop collateral flow even after the fistula has become completely obstructed. From a clinical perspective, when an AV fistula no longer has detectable flow in the dialysis facility, it is generally labeled as a thrombosed AV fistula; however, many, if not most of these, contain no thrombus. Flow can be so diminished that it is no longer detectable or all the flow (diminished) is going through collaterals. Severe stenosis of the AV fistula with a proliferation of collateral vessels frequently results in complex anatomy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30162254\"><span class=\"h2\">Infected fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fistula-associated infections may be either superficial or deep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial infections do not involve the fistula itself and are generally related to a cannulation site. On physical examination, superficial infections appear as small, pustular lesions with minimal or no inflammation, swelling, or pain. They are not fluctuant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep infections are manifested by erythema, swelling, tenderness, and purulence. The erythema is generally localized to the skin overlying the fistula and spreads outward. Swelling is often seen and, on occasion, is fluctuant. The fistula is frequently tender to touch; pain may be present but is variable. The area generally feels warm, but this is not a very reliable sign, because the skin overlying a flowing fistula is always warmer than normal. Deep infections are frequently associated with purulent drainage and may be fluctuant to palpation. Occasionally, infection-associated anatomic abnormalities such as aneurysms, perigraft hematomas, or an abscess from infected needle puncture sites may be observed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30162262\"><span class=\"h2\">Aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An aneurysm is a focal dilation of a vessel with true aneurysms involving all the layers of the vessel, while pseudoaneurysms represent a collection of blood and connective tissue outside the vessel wall, the result of a contained rupture. These manifest as areas of bulging associated with the hemodialysis arteriovenous access. In the case of a fistula, bulging generally represents a true aneurysm rather than a pseudoaneurysm. Aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm cannot be distinguished from each other by physical examination alone. </p><p>The presence of aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms should be monitored by physical examination at each dialysis treatment. If an aneurysm is detected, the size should be documented at each dialysis session. Changes in size should be carefully noted. Patients who have a rapidly enlarging bulge should be referred for a surgical evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H12721750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H288792103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm/megafistula'</a>.)</p><p>The overlying skin should be examined for evidence of marked thinning, ulceration, or spontaneous bleeding. Depigmentation and tightening of the overlying skin may also be observed. Normally, one should be able to pinch the skin over the fistula including an aneurysm between the examiner's index finger and thumb; skin that is tissue-paper thin should prompt surgical evaluation. Ulceration or spontaneous bleeding of an aneurysm should be considered an indication for emergent surgical referral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30162270\"><span class=\"h2\">Extremity ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placement of a fistula may cause hand ischemia. Two clinical variants are recognized, both with characteristic findings on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30162277\"><span class=\"h3\">Dialysis ischemic steal syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis ischemic steal syndrome (or DISS), also called dialysis access steal syndrome (DASS), is characterized by ischemic changes that affect all tissues of the distal extremity to a varying degree of severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. It can occur at any time after access placement. Physical findings depend upon the severity of the steal and on the preexisting status of the peripheral circulation. In most instances, it is very helpful to compare the affected limb with the contralateral one. Patients complain of variable amounts of pain in the hand, which appears pale or cyanotic and feels cool to the touch. The radial pulse is generally diminished or absent (but not variably). Compression of the access augments the distal pulse and may temporarily relieve painful symptoms. Using a Doppler to listen to the bruit over the distal artery frequently aids in this examination. The sound is significantly augmented when the fistula is occluded. With chronic ischemia, ulceration and gangrene at the fingertips may be present. At this time, the patient generally has significant pain and neuropathic changes.

This syndrome is seen immediately following access surgery but needs to be distinguished from DASS in patients with a mature fistula. </p><p>The pathognomic feature of ischemic monomelic neuropathy is the presence of diffuse, neurologic dysfunction, usually in the absence of significant ischemic changes in the tissues of the hand and fingers. The symptoms of the neuropathy include pain, which is often severe; paresthesias; and numbness in the hand, along with diffuse motor weakness or paralysis. Although this generally resembles the palsy associated with radial nerve injury, all three forearm nerves are involved. Thus, poor wrist extension (radial nerve), poor function of the intrinsic hand musculature (ulnar nerve), and poor thumb opposition (median nerve) are typically present. If only a single nerve is affected, the diagnosis of IMN should be questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The sensory deficits are frequently more prominent than the motor deficits. Typically, the hand is warm, and often a palpable radial pulse or audible Doppler signal is present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H304583510\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCURACY OF PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination has a relatively high degree of accuracy in detecting the pathology associated with a dysfunctional arteriovenous (AV) fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

According to Doppler ultrasound, 50 (59 percent) were considered positive for stenosis (a reduction in internal diameter &gt;50 percent).

Stenosis, whether related to outflow or inflow, will lead to fistula dysfunction, which results in inadequate dialysis and eventually thrombosis with the risk of loss of the fistula.</p><p>The two principal options for diagnostic testing are ultrasound imaging or angiography. We prefer angiography rather than ultrasound imaging, because many of the abnormalities that will be detected in the patient with an abnormal physical examination can be adequately treated by endovascular means with a high expectation of success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination of the hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) fistula is easy and inexpensive. Physical examination has a relatively high degree of accuracy for detecting a dysfunctional AV fistula. A systematic physical examination of a mature fistula should be performed at regular intervals to allow early detection of AV fistula problems. If possible, a fistula should be examined by trained clinical staff at every treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H304583510\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy of physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30162225\" class=\"local\">'The mature AV fistula: normal examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common complications associated with an established fistula are venous stenosis, arterial stenosis, thrombosis, aneurysm formation, infection, and ischemia. Physical examination of a mature fistula should be systematically directed toward the exclusion of each of these potential problems. (See <a href=\"#H30162225\" class=\"local\">'The mature AV fistula: normal examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H182032180\" class=\"local\">'Examination to detect specific problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation for stenosis should include inspection, palpation, and auscultation of the AV fistula and extremity pulses, seeking to detect any abnormalities. A healthy AV fistula collapses completely with arm elevation and is generally characterized by a diffuse thrill and soft bruit, both with systolic and diastolic components. (See <a href=\"#H30162225\" class=\"local\">'The mature AV fistula: normal examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Venous stenosis is suggested by a strong pulse over the fistula and a localized, accentuated thrill and high-pitched bruit, both of which lack diastolic components. (See <a href=\"#H30162232\" class=\"local\">'Stenotic vascular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial stenosis may be assessed by evaluating pulse augmentation. The degree of this augmentation is directly proportional to the quality of the fistula inflow. The pulse in a normal fistula will be stronger (augmented) when the fistula is completely occluded a short distance away from the arterial anastomosis. Decreased augmentation suggests stenosis in the juxta-anastomotic region, the anastomosis, or the feeding artery. (See <a href=\"#H182032318\" class=\"local\">'Pulse'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30162232\" class=\"local\">'Stenotic vascular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodynamically significant central venous stenosis may manifest as ipsilateral arm edema, which can be massive. Subcutaneous collateral veins are frequently evident over the arm and chest. Pulsation over the fistula is not as strong as it generally is compared with patients with peripheral venous stenosis. A localized thrill may be felt over the anterior chest, just below the clavicle, and a localized bruit is frequently evident. (See <a href=\"#H30162232\" class=\"local\">'Stenotic vascular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial infections appear as small, pustular lesions with minimal or no inflammation, swelling, or pain. Deep infections manifest with erythema, swelling, tenderness, and purulence. The AV fistula is frequently tender to touch, although pain is variable. The area generally feels warm, but this is not a very reliable sign, because the skin overlying a flowing fistula is usually warmer than normal. (See <a href=\"#H30162254\" class=\"local\">'Infected fistula'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Areas of bulging associated with the AV fistula are generally manifestations of an aneurysm. Aneurysm(s) should be monitored by physical examination at the time of each dialysis treatment. A rapidly enlarging bulge is a sign for concern. The overlying skin should be examined for evidence of marked thinning, ulceration, or spontaneous bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H30162262\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mildly ischemic hand due to dialysis ischemic steal syndrome appears pale or cyanotic and feels cool to the touch. The radial pulse is generally diminished or absent. Occlusion of the fistula may either increase the strength of a previously weak radial pulse or result in the appearance of a previously absent pulse. In severe cases, ischemic changes of the skin are present, particularly at the fingertips. Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN) presents immediately after surgery as neurologic dysfunction (manifested by pain, paresthesias, numbness, and motor weakness) in the absence of significant ischemic changes in the tissues of the hand and fingers. (See <a href=\"#H30162270\" class=\"local\">'Extremity ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be referred for diagnostic testing as soon as a significant abnormality is detected by physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Further diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Beathard GA.
