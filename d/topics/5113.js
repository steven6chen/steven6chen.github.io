DAN may be detected in the majority of patients with diabetes with neurophysiologic testing, but is classified as subclinical or clinical depending upon the presence or absence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A wide spectrum of manifestations affecting many different organ systems can occur, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, pupillary, sudomotor, and neuroendocrine systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79376 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND RISK FACTOR REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapy of diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) can be difficult. It is therefore desirable to prevent this complication or, once established, to slow disease progression.</p><p>Poor glucose control and vascular risk factors appear to be associated with the development of diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This observation is supported by the results of the EURODIAB study, which found that the incidence of neuropathy was associated with poor glucose control, elevated triglyceride levels, elevated body mass index, smoking, and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the effects of these risk factors on diabetic autonomic neuropathy progression are less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Results from a large prospective observational study suggest that the incidence of DAN is declining in type 1 diabetes, potentially reflecting improvements in the management of risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, results from randomized trials suggest that intensive therapy reduces the onset and progression of autonomic neuropathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), intensive therapy with insulin in subjects with type 1 diabetes was found to reduce cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy incidence by 53 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and the benefit of prior intensive therapy was found to persist for up to 14 years in these subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In individuals with type 2 diabetes, the potential efficacy of intensive combined therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria was examined in the Steno type 2 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this prospective open-label trial, 160 patients were randomly assigned to standard or multifactorial intensive therapy. The intensive regimen consisted of behavioral therapy (including advice concerning diet, exercise, and smoking cessation) and pharmacologic intervention (consisting of the administration of multiple agents to attain several aggressive therapeutic goals) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69810 \">table 2</a>). DAN was present at baseline in 28 percent. At the end of the trial (mean follow-up of 7.8 years), intensive therapy reduced both microvascular and macrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, intensive therapy reduced the rate of progression to DAN (30 versus 54 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.79). This benefit was sustained at a mean of 13.3 years (the trial intervention period plus an additional 5.5 years of observational follow-up) with a RR of 0.53 (95% CI 0.34-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, there was no slowing of progression of peripheral neuropathy. The details of the protocol and overall results of this study are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Multifactorial risk factor reduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In some cases, extremely rapid improvements in glycemic control may be associated with the development of both autonomic and peripheral neuropathy in individuals with chronic hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Described as treatment induced neuropathy of diabetes (TIND), the severity of neuropathy was linked to the magnitude of change in the glycated hemoglobin A1C over three months. The risk of neuropathic complications was approximately 10 percent if the hemoglobin A1C decreased by more than 3 percentage points in three months, and exceeded 50 percent if the hemoglobin A1C decreased by 5 or more points in three months. These findings suggest that in individuals with chronic hyperglycemia, the achievement of a target hemoglobin A1C (as suggested by the DCCT and Steno 2 trials) should be achieved gradually, and not exceed a 3 point change in hemoglobin A1C in three months. Treatment induced neuropathy in diabetes is more common in those with type 1 diabetes, most likely because of the rapid change in glycemic control that can occur with the use of insulin.</p><p>Not all experts are convinced that overly rapid glycemic control or reduction in hemoglobin A1C can cause neuropathy. The data supporting it come from uncontrolled and retrospective studies. The prevalence of this problem is unknown, as the most recent data on the subject are from a specialty tertiary referral center that may not reflect the general population. Although no evidence of the TIND phenomenon was observed in data from prospective controlled trials such as the DCCT, there was no measurement of small fiber neuropathy in such trials. Interestingly, &quot;early worsening retinopathy&quot; was noted within the DCCT trials, a phenomenon also seen in individuals with TIND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. The parallel development of retinopathy and neuropathy in acute glycemic control does suggest an inflammatory microvascular process. An alternative explanation is that the worsening of neuropathy is an epiphenomenon associated with but not caused by overly rapid glycemic control. To date, the data have only suggested an association, not causation. Thus, prospective, controlled studies would be helpful to resolve the relationship between glycemic control and the development of neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (frequently abbreviated as CAN in the literature) is defined as the impairment of autonomic control of the cardiovascular system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is associated with several abnormalities in autonomic cardiovascular function. The prevalence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy varies considerably, which reflects the tests used, diagnostic criteria, and the population studied.<strong> </strong>Subclinically, the disease is defined by cardiovascular reflex testing, which may have prognostic implications. Clinically, the impairment in autonomic function is associated with resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, intraoperative cardiovascular instability, silent myocardial infarction and ischemia, and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tachycardia and exercise intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest clinical manifestation of cardiac autonomic neuropathy may be a resting tachycardia. The increased resting heart rate is due to unopposed cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. As the autonomic neuropathy progresses, the heart rate gradually slows and in advanced cases will manifest as a fixed heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Exercise intolerance is usually due to impaired augmentation of cardiac output resulting from inadequate sympathetic modulation. Persistent sinus tachycardia can occur and there may be no variation in heart rate during activities that normally increase heart rate variability, such as deep breathing and the Valsalva maneuver.</p><p>Considerable interest has centered upon the role of abnormal myocardial electrical activity in arrhythmogenesis including, for example, QT prolongation and altered ventricular repolarization. In the EURODIAB Type 1 Complications Study, the prevalence of QT prolongation was 16 percent overall (11 percent in men, 21 percent in women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Cardiac denervation can occur in diabetic patients with advanced autonomic neuropathy. It is characterized by a fixed heart rate, in the range of 80 to 90 beats per minute, and is associated with painless myocardial infarction and sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Orthostatic (postural) hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a fall in blood pressure of &ge;20 mmHg systolic or &ge;10 mmHg diastolic within three minutes of moving from a supine position to an upright tilt table test or standing position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Orthostatic hypotension results from a combination of central and peripheral cardiovascular sympathetic denervation. It reflects failure of vasoconstriction in both the splanchnic and peripheral vascular beds. In its most severe disabling form, orthostatic hypotension can cause significant drops in blood pressure resulting in syncope. Retrospective data suggest that the presence of orthostatic hypotension is associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presence of orthostatic hypotension in diabetes is associated with a significant increase in 10-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Fortunately, this severity of orthostasis is rare, with the majority of patients having milder symptoms which are amenable to therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Orthostasis with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) may have the following hemodynamic characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A loss of the diurnal variation in blood pressure, with supine hypertension occurring at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This may also occur to a lesser degree in diabetic patients without neuropathy. In addition, ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring has detected hypertension in over 50 percent of subjects with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, despite normal office blood pressure measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is possible that day-to-day variability of symptoms may be exacerbated by insulin therapy, which has provoked hypotension in both diabetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and nondiabetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] patients with autonomic failure, although the clinical relevance of this to most patients with diabetes is not known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-prandial hypotension, whereby supine and standing systolic blood pressures may fall profoundly after meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The mechanism of postprandial hypotension in DAN is unclear. Both inadequate sympathetic compensation to meal-induced pooling of blood in the splanchnic circulation and vasodilatory gut peptides may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. A hematocrit should also be checked, since anemia can result from erythropoietin deficiency secondary to renal denervation, which may exacerbate orthostatic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms, causes, and evaluation of orthostatic hypotension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Postural tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A posture-induced tachycardia without a fall in blood pressure can result in significant postural symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and pre-syncope. Although postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous disorder, a diagnosis of POTS should not be made in individuals with diabetes; a more appropriate diagnosis would be diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Postural tachycardia typically seen in patients with diabetes who have a high resting heart rate due to vagal cardiac neuropathy with an unopposed cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. This is very different from a diagnosis of POTS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postural-tachycardia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postural tachycardia syndrome&quot;</a>). The distinction between POTS and postural tachycardia related to DAN is a critical point for physicians to be aware of, because many patients with diabetes are misdiagnosed with POTS. The importance of diabetic autonomic neuropathy and the relationship to glycemic control are dismissed with a diagnosis of POTS, and the associated risks of morbidity and mortality are not typically considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least two meta-analyses of diabetic patients have found that cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In one meta-analysis, the mortality of autonomic neuropathy-free subjects over 5.5 years was approximately 5 percent, but this increased to 27 percent with the onset of abnormal cardiovascular reflex tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a subsequent meta-analysis, the magnitude of the association was stronger for studies that required more than one abnormality of cardiovascular function to define cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In the ACCORD trial, over a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, subjects with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy at baseline had overall mortality and cardiovascular mortality rates that were approximately 1.6 to 2.1 and 1.9 to 3.0 times higher, respectively, compared with those who did not have cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, even after adjusting for baseline cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal studies of patients with DAN have typically found mortality rates over five years ranging between 16 and 53 percent (mean of approximately 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. Although the majority of deaths result from associated macrovascular and microvascular disease, cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to autonomic denervation has been implicated in some diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study of over 2700 subjects with type 1 diabetes, an annual mortality rate of 5 per 1000 person-years was reported, with peripheral neuropathy (standardized hazard ratio [SHR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.06-3.35) and autonomic neuropathy (SHR 2.40, 95% CI 1.32-4.36) being the most important risk markers for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>There are several potential mechanisms by which diabetic autonomic neuropathy may increase mortality rates. First, numerous studies have reported diminished perception of cardiac ischemia in individuals with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Second, there is reduced cardiovascular response to physiologic stressors such as surgery or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Third, there is an association between DAN and cardiac arrhythmias due to alterations in QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Fourth, alterations in the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems have also been considered to be pro-arrhythmogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Finally, denervated myocardial tissue that have focal areas of re-innervation may be at increased risk for arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Despite the evidence that DAN is associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality, sudden cardiac death in patients with DAN may have a stronger relationship with atherosclerotic heart disease and nephropathy than with DAN itself. In the Rochester Diabetic Neuropathy Study (RDNS), a prospective, longitudinal, population-based study, 21 cases of sudden cardiac death occurred in 462 patients with diabetes (151 with type 1) who were followed for over 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. All 21 with sudden cardiac death had evidence of preceding severe atherosclerosis and myocardial damage. After adjusting for ECG abnormalities (including evolving or previous Q wave changes indicative of myocardial infarction, left bundle branch block, or pacing) and stage of nephropathy, autonomic dysfunction was not significantly associated with sudden cardiac death.</p><p>Conversely, in a prospective observational study that followed patients with type 1 diabetes who had nephropathy (n = 197) or no nephropathy (n = 191) for 10 years, the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (as measured by decreased heart rate variability) in the patients with nephropathy was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Studies reporting the highest mortality rates have typically enrolled symptomatic patients with abnormalities of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Postural hypotension appears to predict a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse cardiovascular events and silent ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes and with silent ischemia, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the DIAD study, 522 patients with type 2 diabetes and no known or suspected coronary artery disease at baseline had adenosine stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging studies, and silent ischemia was detected in 113 (22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 120 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and no history of myocardial infarction or angina but at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors followed for an average of 4.5 years found that a major cardiac event was significantly more common in patients with CAN than in those without CAN (24 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 12 cross-sectional studies found that patients with CAN had a significantly higher frequency of silent myocardial ischemia than patients without CAN (pooled prevalence rate ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.53-2.51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>The mechanisms of silent myocardial ischemia are complex and not completely understood.

There is no evidence that any one test has diagnostic superiority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/14,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,64,65</a>], although it is rare that a single test would be administered. </p><p>Some experts believe, based on data from a meta-analysis, that a confident diagnosis of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy requires abnormalities in more than one test, which evaluate different limbs of the reflex arc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. This notion underlies proposed criteria for the diagnosis and staging of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], which identify possible or early cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy on the basis of one abnormal cardiovagal test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], definite or confirmed cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy on the basis of two abnormal cardiovagal tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], and severe or advanced cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy by the additional presence of orthostatic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], which usually occurs late in the course of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>Direct assessment of cardiac sympathetic integrity is possible with radiolabeled analogues of norepinephrine, which are actively taken up by the sympathetic nerve terminals of the heart.

The diagnosis of diabetic gastroparesis is established by evidence of delayed gastric emptying on scintigraphy in the absence of an obstructing structural lesion in the stomach or small intestine by endoscopy or imaging. Primary treatment of diabetic gastroparesis includes improved glycemic control, dietary modification, and administration of antiemetic and prokinetic agents in symptomatic patients.

The diarrhea is watery and painless, occurs at night, and may be associated with fecal incontinence. Bouts of diarrhea can be episodic with intermittent, normal bowel habits or even alternating with periods of constipation. Management of diabetic diarrhea includes general measures such as hydration and correction of electrolyte and nutrient deficiency, symptomatic treatment of diarrhea with antidiarrheals, and treatment of the underlying cause (eg, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth).
