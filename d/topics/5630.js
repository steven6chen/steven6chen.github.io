Chromosomes are tiny parts of cells that carry the plans that make our bodies the way they are. People with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome. This causes their problems and makes them look a little different from people without Down syndrome.</p><p>Doctors do not know why some babies are born with Down syndrome.
