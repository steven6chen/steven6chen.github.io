Although metastatic breast cancer is unlikely to be cured, meaningful improvements in survival have been seen, coincident with the introduction of newer systemic therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-for-her2-positive-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Current treatment options vary based on whether the tumor is hormone receptor-positive (estrogen [ER] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone receptor [PR]-positive) and whether or not human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed (ie, HER2-positive). At the current time, there are no other validated predictive markers for specific molecularly targeted therapies in breast cancer.</p><p>The treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is reviewed here.
