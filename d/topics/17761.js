Mold endophthalmitis often results in loss of vision.</p><p>The treatment of endophthalmitis due to molds will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis are discussed elsewhere.

In most cases of endogenous mold endophthalmitis, the highly vascular choroid is seeded first, and the infection typically progresses from the &quot;back&quot; of the eye (posterior segment) anteriorly.<br/><br/><strong>Exogenous endophthalmitis </strong>means the infection was introduced from the &quot;outside,&quot; for example, following eye surgery, eye trauma, or extension of fungal infection of the cornea (termed &quot;fungal keratitis&quot; or &quot;keratomycosis&quot;). In exogenous endophthalmitis, the aqueous is typically infected first and, in some cases, the vitreous is not involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H634314713\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of mold endophthalmitis typically involves a combination of vitrectomy, intravitreal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intracameral (into the anterior chamber) injection of an antifungal agent, removal of foreign materials (eg, intraocular lens), and systemic antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Corneal transplantation is indicated in some cases of mold keratitis (corneal infection) that have extended to the aqueous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. No controlled trials of treatment regimens for mold endophthalmitis have been performed given its rarity. The evidence regarding the treatment of mold endophthalmitis comes from case reports and case series. Even with therapy, there is a high rate of loss of useful vision, but the prognosis may be improving with the availability of newer antifungal agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>. (See <a href=\"#H234846856\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365246849\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitrectomy and removal of foreign bodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical removal of the vitreous, or vitrectomy, is nearly always necessary in mold endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Vitrectomy entails the use of a vitrector, an instrument inserted into the vitreous cavity that simultaneously cuts and aspirates some of the approximately 4 mL of gel-like vitreous into a canister (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59512 \">figure 2</a>). During this process, a separate cannula infuses <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanced-salt-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">balanced salt solution</a> into the vitreous cavity to maintain intraocular pressure. By the end of the case, the canister contains dilute vitreous &quot;washings&quot; (eg, 50 to 100 mL). Vitrectomy decreases the burden of fungi quickly by debriding the vitreous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Samples are obtained during vitrectomy for microbiologic studies, and intravitreal antibiotics are injected at the end of the case. A vitrectomy, which is typically performed with local anesthesia with sedation, may be difficult if there is so much inflammation that the retina surgeon cannot see the retina. In patients too ill for eye surgery, a needle aspiration of the vitreous (for stains and cultures) followed by an intravitreal antibiotic injection should be performed. If the aqueous is primarily involved, then needle aspiration of aqueous plus intracameral antibiotic injection should be performed.</p><p>If only the aqueous is involved, as may occur in some cases of keratomycosis, then a vitrectomy may not be necessary. Even in such cases, intravitreal injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> is often given in addition to injection into the aqueous (intracameral injection) due to concern for occult extension of fungal infection into the vitreous. Intravitreal and intracameral injections are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H278655734\" class=\"local\">'Intravitreal antifungal therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H278655727\" class=\"local\">'Intracameral antifungal therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Successful treatment of mold endophthalmitis also requires removal of any foreign material (eg, an intraocular lens placed during cataract surgery or a foreign body introduced by penetrating eye trauma). Leaving any such foreign material in place may allow persistent infection despite antifungal therapy and nearly always leads to relapse of infection. Leaving an intraocular lens in place in post-cataract fungal endophthalmitis is a risk factor for poor visual outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61418791\"><span class=\"h2\">Corneal transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corneal transplantation may be indicated in cases of keratomycosis due to molds in which the infection has extended into the aqueous.

The treatment of <em>Fusarium</em> keratitis is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-fusarium-infection#H346085004\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Fusarium infection&quot;, section on 'Keratitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278655734\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravitreal antifungal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraocular injection of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> is necessary for nearly all cases of mold endophthalmitis to ensure the rapid achievement of high levels of an antifungal drug inside the eye. Intravitreal amphotericin B deoxycholate has been used for many years; the usual dose is 5 or 10 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Intravitreal voriconazole has been used successfully in a number of cases and appears to have less toxicity than amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>]. No studies have directly compared intravitreal amphotericin B to voriconazole. The usual dose of intravitreal voriconazole is 100 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Observations regarding the use of intravitreal antifungal therapy (in combination with the other modalities described above) have been reported in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study from India of 113 patients with fungal endophthalmitis treated between 1992 and 2005, there were 43 cases of culture-proven mold endophthalmitis (31 caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp and 12 due to other molds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The treatment regimen included vitrectomy and 5 mcg of intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> in all patients. At three months, of the 43 patients, 36 (84 percent) had a favorable anatomic outcome and 13 (30 percent) had visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/400</span> or better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 41 exogenous fungal endophthalmitis cases seen at an eye institute in Florida between 1990 and 2006, molds accounted for 35 cases (85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of the 41 cases, 18 were associated with fungal keratitis, 10 occurred after penetrating eye trauma, and 13 occurred after eye surgery. Treatment included intraocular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> in 88 percent of cases (intravitreally in 30, intracamerally in 8), and 10 patients received intraocular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> (intravitreally in 6, intracamerally in 4). Vitrectomy was performed in 61 percent of eyes. Visual outcomes varied significantly between groups. Following treatment, a vision of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/400</span> or better was achieved in the involved eyes of 22 patients (54 percent), but 21 of these were in the keratitis or postoperative groups. Patients in the post-eye trauma group had poor visual outcomes, and 7 of the 10 involved eyes were enucleated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other small series and individual case reports of mold endophthalmitis, intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> was used with or without other measures, such as vitrectomy or anterior chamber washout, and patients appeared to have improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/10,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13-16</a>].</p><p/><p>High doses of intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> are toxic to the retina, but an intravitreal injection of 5 or 10 mcg (in 0.1 mL sterile water) appears to be safe and may be repeated several days later if evidence of intraocular infection persists on serial examinations. Patients have received cumulative intravitreal doses of 30 mcg amphotericin B deoxycholate without apparent retinal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Based on animal studies and case reports, intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> also appears to be safe. In in vitro toxicity studies of human retinal pigment epithelium cells and primary human ocular nerve head astrocytes, a concentration of voriconazole of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> vitreous appears to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a study of rats, a dose of up to 25 mcg per mL vitreous was found to be safe based on electroretinography and histopathology findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This dose corresponds to an injection of 100 mcg into the adult human vitreous, which has a volume of approximately 4 mL. A dose of 50 to 100 mcg of voriconazole in 0.1 mL sterile water has been used in patients without apparent toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/6,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278655727\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracameral antifungal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare cases in which the aqueous humor is significantly involved, such as in early postcataract mold endophthalmitis or early endophthalmitis due to keratomycosis, an intracameral (into the anterior chamber) injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> should be given. Intracameral amphotericin B deoxycholate has been used for many years to treat exogenous fungal endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. More recently, it has been used to treat refractory cases of keratomycosis, including some with extension into the aqueous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Increasingly, intracameral and intravitreal voriconazole have been used in place of amphotericin B. The rationale for intracameral injections is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-exogenous-endophthalmitis-due-to-candida-species#H728946907\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of exogenous endophthalmitis due to Candida species&quot;, section on 'Intraocular therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The usual dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> for intracameral injection is 5 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water. Transient increase in eye pain (lasting up to 12 hours) and anterior chamber inflammation, including hypopyon, have occurred following intracameral amphotericin B injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].</p><p>The optimal dose of intracameral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> has not been well established, but 50 to 100 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water is usually used. Intracameral voriconazole has been used without apparent toxicity. In one in vitro study of cultured human ocular cells, a concentration of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of voriconazole for 30 days did not appear to cause toxicity either to corneal or endothelial trabecular meshwork cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another in vitro study, voriconazole concentrations up to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> did not decrease the viability of corneal endothelial cells, but concentrations &ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> led to a reduction in cell viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Several studies have reported effective use of intracameral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> at doses ranging from 12.5 mcg to 100 mcg in 0.1 mL sterile water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/8,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,12</a>]. Intracameral doses of 100 mcg of voriconazole have been used repeatedly in some eyes without any apparent toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but we prefer a dose of 50 mcg due to the limited experience with intracameral voriconazole and because this dose produces sufficiently high concentrations in the aqueous. A case series from Taiwan evaluated the experience of using intracameral voriconazole to treat 10 eyes with mold endophthalmitis involving only the anterior segment as a consequence of extension of keratomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In these patients, 100 mcg of voriconazole was injected intracamerally from one to eight times; seven patients received five or more injections without apparent toxicity. Eyes in which multiple doses were given were injected daily. In four eyes, vision improved at least one Snellen line following treatment, whereas in five eyes, vision did not improve. In all cases, clinical findings suggesting fungal invasion of the anterior chamber resolved after treatment.</p><p>Intracameral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> has been shown to have a half-life of only 22 minutes in an experimental rabbit model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], so topical voriconazole 1 percent solution can be used to prolong the drug level in the aqueous. Application of 1 percent voriconazole ophthalmic solution (eyedrops) every 2 hours for 24 hours prior to scheduled eye surgery produced high levels in the aqueous in one study of 13 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In cases of exogenous fungal endophthalmitis resulting from fungal keratitis, the keratitis should also be treated with antifungal eyedrops. Topical voriconazole eyedrops (1 percent) are preferred in these cases since topical voriconazole penetrates the cornea and achieves good levels in the aqueous, whereas topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> does not. If voriconazole ophthalmic solution cannot be used (eg, if the fungus is not expected to be susceptible), amphotericin B deoxycholate ophthalmic solution (0.15 percent in sterile water) can be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311134809\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical antifungal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> 1% solution nor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> 0.15% solution are commercially available as eye drops, but both have been widely used for treatment of keratomycosis. Their role in the treatment of mold endophthalmitis has not been defined, but topical voriconazole may be indicated as adjunctive therapy in some cases. Topical voriconazole penetrates the intact human cornea, and repeated application may produce therapeutic levels in the aqueous. One study of 16 patients with intact corneas found that repeated doses of topical voriconazole 1% produced aqueous levels that are therapeutic for most fungi; aqueous levels were 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> after hourly application for five hours and 4.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> after every two-hour application for nine hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]<em>.</em> Therefore, topical application of voriconazole may be helpful as adjunctive therapy (in addition to other measures such as intracameral voriconazole) for cases of endophthalmitis due to voriconazole-susceptible molds primarily involving the aqueous. For topical amphotericin B deoxycholate, no human studies are available. However, studies in rabbits show that topical amphotericin B does not penetrate an intact cornea but does penetrate a corneal debrided of epithelium. One study in rabbits found that the aqueous level of amphotericin was 0.82 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> 30 minutes after amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.25% drops were given every 5 minutes for 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It is therefore possible that in patients with keratomycosis-associated endophthalmitis primarily involving the aqueous, amphotericin B eye drops may have some benefit as adjunctive therapy in cases due to voriconazole-resistant fungi.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365247006\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic antifungal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic antifungal therapy is indicated for endogenous mold endophthalmitis, and the choice of systemic therapy should be based on optimal treatment for invasive fungal infection. The treatment of invasive fungal infections is discussed in detail separately.

Systemic amphotericin B is not usually given in exogenous endophthalmitis because the significant toxicity of this therapy is usually not justified by the minimal benefit, if any. In experimental studies, systemic amphotericin B deoxycholate achieves minimal intraocular levels in uninflamed rabbit eyes, although higher levels are achieved in inflamed rabbit eyes when multiple-dose regimens are used over seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Liposomal amphotericin may achieve higher vitreous concentrations than other lipid formulations of amphotericin B or amphotericin B deoxycholate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> is the treatment of choice for systemic <em>Aspergillus</em> infections; it is also active against <em>Fusarium</em> and these two fungi account for the majority of mold endophthalmitis cases. Voriconazole achieves vitreous levels with oral administration that are nearly 40 percent of plasma levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition to endophthalmitis caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp and <em>Fusarium</em> spp, voriconazole has also been used to treat endophthalmitis due to <em>Paecilomyces lilacinus</em>, <em>Scedosporium apiospermum</em>, and <em>Lecythophora mutabilis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds/abstract/14,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31-33</a>].
