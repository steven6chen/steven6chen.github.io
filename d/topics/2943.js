Cardioversion is the delivery of energy that is synchronized to the QRS complex, while defibrillation is asynchronous delivery of a shock randomly during the cardiac cycle.</p><p>Early defibrillators delivered energy in a monophasic waveform, meaning that electrons flowed in a single direction. The newer defibrillators deliver a biphasic waveform, meaning that during the shock, polarity and electron flow reverse. In addition to reversing polarity, biphasic defibrillators also deliver a more consistent magnitude of current (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51842 \">figure 1</a>). In general, biphasic defibrillators successfully terminate arrhythmias at lower energies than monophasic defibrillators. The relative efficacy of biphasic and monophasic defibrillators has been compared in a number of settings and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;, section on 'Monophasic versus biphasic waveforms'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the clinical settings in which electrical cardioversion and defibrillation are used, along with a brief discussion of the complications that can occur independent of the arrhythmia that is being treated. The basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation, the specific indications for external cardioversion and defibrillation, and the use of the automated external defibrillator are presented separately.

An advantage of having an anesthesiologist routinely administer sedation for elective cardioversions is that at many hospitals, the use of ultra-short acting sedatives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> is restricted to anesthesiologists. The tradeoff for such involvement is often added costs and scheduling complexity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Elective cardioversions for atrial fibrillation and flutter can also be safely performed autonomously by a midlevel provider. With appropriate clinical training, a protocol that includes a guideline-directed procedural checklist, physician supervision, and sedation administered by an anesthesiologist, an advanced practice nurse can safely perform cardioversions autonomously with excellent patient satisfaction and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9896272\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplemental oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen is a fire hazard in the event of electrical arcing during external cardioversion or defibrillation. Because of this, supplemental oxygen flow should be stopped, or the oxygen delivery device (eg, nasal cannula, face mask, etc) removed from the patient, prior to the delivery of an external shock. Oxygen flow can be restarted after the shock has been delivered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1172679957\"><span class=\"h2\">Paddle/pad placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For electrical cardioversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, an anterior-posterior pad position is preferred to anterior-lateral placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103268 \">figure 2</a>) based on evidence from several randomized trials that have shown higher success rates and lower energy requirements for successful cardioversion with the anterior-posterior configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The historical rationale for the superiority of the anterior-posterior position is a more favorable shock vector through the atria as well as reduced transthoracic impedance. Moreover, there is some evidence that applying external force to self-adhesive electrodes may decrease transthoracic impedance further [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, pad placement may not significantly affect outcomes of cardioversion with contemporary defibrillator devices that employ impedance compensated biphasic waveforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For urgent <span class=\"nowrap\">cardioversion/defibrillation</span> of unstable rhythms, an anterior-lateral pad configuration may be preferred for ease of application, and device manufacturer recommendations should be followed in all cases.

The energy selected should be sufficient to accomplish prompt defibrillation because repeated failures expose the heart to damage from prolonged ischemia and multiple shocks. On the other hand, excessive energy should be avoided, since myocardial damage from high-energy shocks has been demonstrated in experimental studies, although the frequency with which this occurs in humans is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>In 2010, the American Heart Association issued guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care that discussed detailed starting energy levels for treatment of various types of arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC/HRS</span> guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation, no specific energy levels for cardioversion or defibrillation are discussed, but some broad concepts are presented. We agree with the suggested initial energy selection for specific arrhythmias as addressed in the society guidelines, with the following suggested initial energy requirements for monophasic and biphasic waveforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When available, a biphasic defibrillator is preferred due to greater efficacy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For atrial fibrillation, 120 to 200 joules for biphasic devices and 200 joules for monophasic devices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62714\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62714 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For atrial flutter, 50 to 100 joules for biphasic devices and 100 joules for monophasic devices.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For ventricular tachycardia with a pulse, 100 joules for biphasic devices and 200 joules for monophasic devices.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, 120 to 200 joules for biphasic devices and 360 joules for monophasic devices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73862\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73862 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To increase the likelihood of initial shock success and reduce the duration of sedation, a higher initial energy may be considered.</p><p/><p>When an external defibrillator is being prepared to deliver a rescue shock in the event that an implantable defibrillator fails to convert a patient during defibrillation threshold testing, the energy should be set to the maximum output and in the asynchronous mode.</p><p>Cardioversion with higher energy levels may be effective when prior cardioversion attempts using a maximal energy of 360 joules have failed to restore sinus rhythm. In one study, 55 patients who did not have sinus rhythm restored after at least two attempts of external cardioversion with 360 joules underwent cardioversion with 720 joules, which was performed by using two external cardioverters, each connected to its own pair of patches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sinus rhythm was restored in 84 percent of these patients with no major complications, hemodynamic compromise, or strokes occurring after the procedure.</p><p>As another option besides high-energy cardioversion, pretreatment with an antiarrhythmic drug can facilitate cardioversion at lower energy levels. Pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> prior to electrical cardioversion has been shown to significantly improve the rate of successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm and was also associated with the use of significantly lower energy levels to achieve cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> have also been shown to increase the likelihood of successful cardioversion or lower the energy threshold required for cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When an antiarrhythmic drug is chosen, however, the potential side effects must be carefully considered.

For example, electrical cardioversion success rates approach 100 percent in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation of short duration and no structural heart disease, while the success rates are much lower in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and concomitant mitral valve disease. The term &quot;failed cardioversion&quot; can indicate failure to restore sinus rhythm at all, or an immediate recurrence of the arrhythmia. It is important to differentiate these two failure mechanisms because different approaches can be used to address each type of failure.</p><p>While antiarrhythmic medications can sometimes result in restoration of sinus rhythm without electrical cardioversion, they are primarily used in an effort to maintain sinus rhythm following successful electrical cardioversion. However, many antiarrhythmic drugs can alter the defibrillation threshold, ie, the minimal amount of energy necessary for reversion of an arrhythmia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81781 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> may cause a significant rise in defibrillation thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].

Cardioversion is part of the overall treatment approach to AF, which also includes rate control and anticoagulation. To reduce the risk of thromboembolism following cardioversion, anticoagulation is generally recommended for three to four weeks before and after cardioversion. Alternatively, the presence of existing intracardiac thrombus should be excluded using transesophageal echocardiography prior to cardioversion if therapeutic anticoagulation has not been achieved. Detailed discussions regarding the decision to perform cardioversion versus rate control, as well as the optimal approach to anticoagulation, are provided elsewhere.

The overall success rate (at any level of energy) of electrical cardioversion for AF is 75 to 95 percent and is related inversely both to the duration of AF and to left atrial size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most modern defibrillators deliver biphasic waveforms. When biphasic waveforms are used, the energy requirements are less (generally 50 percent of that required with monophasic waveforms) and efficacy is higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In a study of 912 patients with AF or atrial flutter, restoration of sinus rhythm was higher with the use of biphasic waveforms (94 versus 84 percent for monophasic waveforms) and the cumulative energy was lower (199 J versus 554 J) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Both studies showed a trend toward a lower incidence of the primary endpoint with rate control and anticoagulation (hazard ratio 0.87 for mortality in AFFIRM and 0.73 for a composite endpoint in RACE). In addition, embolization occurred with equal frequency regardless of whether a rhythm control or a rate control strategy was adopted. In both groups, embolization primarily occurred after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> had been stopped or when the INR was subtherapeutic.

In a review including 985 cardioversions in 840 patients with atrial flutter, the median energy level for successful cardioversion was 50 joules with a biphasic defibrillatory and 200 joules with a monophasic defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

While starting at 50 to 100 joules may be effective for cardioversion of atypical (type II) atrial flutter, particularly with biphasic defibrillators, this approach has the potential adverse effect of requiring additional shocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

However, if these arrhythmias persist and electrical cardioversion is attempted, cardioversion is usually successful but may require relatively high energy levels, probably due to the deep location of the reentrant pathway. If sinus rhythm is not restored following an initial 50 to 100 joule shock, subsequent shocks should be at higher energy levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62714\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62714 \">algorithm 1</a>). Although energy requirements with biphasic waveforms have not been reported, they are likely to be lower than for monophasic waveforms based upon experience with other arrhythmias.

If a distinct QRS and T wave are identified, allowing the delivery of energy to be synchronized to the QRS complex, monomorphic VT can often be terminated with a low-energy shock. Despite the potential for terminating VT with very low-energy shocks, one must consider the seriousness of the arrhythmia and the desire to avoid repeated shocks. As a result, the initial synchronized shock in these circumstances is recommended to be 100 joules with either a biphasic or monophasic waveform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62714\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62714 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In these settings, there is a potential for delivery of a discharge on the T wave, possibly provoking ventricular fibrillation. Under these circumstances, nonsynchronized defibrillation should be performed starting with 120 to 200 joules for a biphasic device or 360 joules for a monophasic device.

However, the success rate falls substantially as the duration of ventricular fibrillation increases, probably due to myocardial ischemia, acidosis, and other metabolic changes. These cellular changes are associated with an electrophysiologic deterioration of ventricular fibrillation, leading to an increase in fibrillation cycle length and prolonged diastolic duration between fibrillation action potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>For these reasons, defibrillation as soon as possible has been considered to be the standard of care for VF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73862\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73862 \">algorithm 2</a>). Some studies suggest that when VF has been present for longer than four to five minutes, outcomes are better if cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed prior to defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The recommended starting energy to effectively defibrillate VF is 360 joules when monophasic waveforms are used and 120 to 200 joules with biphasic waveforms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62714\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62714 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is no reported benefit to using more than 360 joules, and there may be harm since high-energy shocks may be associated with myocardial damage and the risk for developing new arrhythmias.

Elective cardioversion should be initiated with the lowest indicated energy (which will vary depending on the arrhythmia) in order to avoid damage to the device circuitry and the electrode-myocardial interface. After cardioversion, the pacemaker should be interrogated and evaluated to ensure normal pacemaker function.

Cardioversion can also induce VF, usually but not always after the administration of an asynchronous shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias does not appear to be related to the number of shocks and cannot be prevented by antiarrhythmic therapy.

Thromboembolism after the return of synchronous atrial contraction can occur because of dislodgement of left atrial thrombi present at the time of cardioversion or a thrombus that forms after cardioversion due to transient post conversion left atrial mechanical dysfunction. This complication is more likely to occur in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have not been anticoagulated prior to cardioversion. Patients with a previous embolism do not have an increased risk of embolization if anticoagulation of adequate intensity and length are administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The estimated incidence of thromboembolism varies, but in a large nonrandomized series that included 437 patients, thromboembolism occurred in 5.3 percent of patients who were not anticoagulated compared with 0.8 percent of those who were receiving anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

As such, we do not routinely monitor cardiac enzymes following electrical cardioversion in asymptomatic patients.</p><p>Although the cause is unknown, it has been suggested that myocardial necrosis may be due to the sustained depolarization of a critical mass of myocardial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

This is related in part to defibrillation, but is also a result of the arrhythmia itself and due to the absence of cardiac output and coronary blood flow during the period of arrest with resultant ischemia. Myocardial dysfunction due to stunning may reverse within the first 24 to 48 hours after cardiac arrest. It is routine to image the heart and evaluate ventricular function shortly after a patient suffers a cardiac arrest to determine if there is evidence of structural heart disease. This evaluation should not be delayed. However, it is important to recognize that ventricular dysfunction may be transient and that imaging should be repeated within a few days if ventricular dysfunction is present immediately after the arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>In animals, the severity of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is related, in part, to the energy used for defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Cardioversion is the delivery of energy that is synchronized to the QRS complex, while defibrillation is asynchronous delivery of a shock randomly during the cardiac cycle. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical cardioversion success rates approach 100 percent in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation of short duration and no structural heart disease, while the success rates are much lower in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and concomitant mitral valve disease. The term &quot;failed cardioversion&quot; can indicate failure to restore sinus rhythm at all, or an immediate recurrence of the arrhythmia. It is important to differentiate these two failure mechanisms because different approaches can be used to address each type of failure. (See <a href=\"#H1682749\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Atrial flutter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical cardioversion is usually successful in the acute treatment of ventricular tachycardia. If a distinct QRS and T wave are identified, synchronized cardioversion can be attempted. In contrast, synchronized cardioversion may be impossible or hazardous if distinct QRS complexes are not identified. As such, under these circumstances, asynchronous defibrillation should be used. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular tachycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defibrillation is the only definitive treatment for ventricular fibrillation (VF), with high success rates when performed promptly. However, the success rate falls substantially as the duration of ventricular fibrillation increases, probably due to myocardial ischemia, acidosis, and other metabolic changes. For these reasons, defibrillation as soon as possible has been considered to be the standard of care for VF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73862\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73862 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once an arrhythmia has been identified, the most important factor in the likelihood of a successful cardioversion or defibrillation is the choice of the initial energy level to be delivered to the patient. The following are suggested initial energy requirements for monophasic and biphasic waveforms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-electrical-cardioversion-and-defibrillation#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of electrical cardioversion and defibrillation&quot;, section on 'Energy selection for cardioversion and defibrillation'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When available, a biphasic defibrillator is preferred due to greater efficacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For atrial fibrillation, 120 to 200 joules for biphasic devices and 200 joules for monophasic devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For atrial flutter, 50 to 100 joules for biphasic devices and 100 joules for monophasic devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For ventricular tachycardia with a pulse, 100 joules for both biphasic and monophasic devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, 120 to 200 joules for biphasic devices and 360 joules for monophasic devices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To increase the likelihood of initial shock success and reduce the duration of sedation, a higher initial energy may be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While electrical cardioversion and defibrillation are generally well tolerated, complications may occur. Most complications are self-limited (eg, changes in the electrocardiogram, hypotension related to sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasodilation) or relatively benign (eg, skin irritation). However, providers should be aware of potential life-threatening complications such as post-cardioversion arrhythmias and thromboembolism. (See <a href=\"#H2560757\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Internal or intracardiac cardioversion is an effective technique for patients in whom external cardioversion has failed to restore sinus rhythm. The need for internal cardioversion has been greatly diminished due to the efficacy of biphasic waveform defibrillators in restoring sinus rhythm. Given the invasive nature of the procedure, specialized training is required to perform internal cardioversion. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Internal cardioversion/defibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4058641990\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editors of UpToDate would like to acknowledge Ramsey Wehbe, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Strzelczyk TA, Kaplan RM, Medler M, Knight BP.
