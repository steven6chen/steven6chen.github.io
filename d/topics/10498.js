The liver is the dominant metastatic site for patients with CRC, and although two-thirds of affected patients have extrahepatic spread, some have disease that is isolated to the liver. For patients with isolated liver metastases, regional treatment approaches may be considered as an alternative to or in combination with systemic chemotherapy.</p><p>The available regional treatments for hepatic metastases from CRC include surgical resection, local tumor ablation (ie, instillation of alcohol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> directly into the metastatic lesions, radiofrequency ablation [RFA]), regional hepatic intraarterial chemotherapy or chemoembolization, and radiation therapy (RT). Among these treatments, only surgery is associated with a survival plateau.</p><p>Although hepatic resection used to be reserved for patients with a maximum of three lesions in the same lobe if it was possible to achieve 1 cm margins and those without portal lymph node metastases, all of these &quot;rules&quot; have been challenged in the modern era, particularly with advancements in both surgical technique and systemic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Profound improvements in the outcomes of patients with metastatic CRC over the past 15 years have been attributed to increased use of hepatic resection in selected patients and more effective chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: Completed clinical trials&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, the criteria for defining which patients are suited for surgical therapy have evolved, and many surgeons take an aggressive stance in the management of hepatic metastases.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the selection of patients for and benefits of resection, and integration of systemic chemotherapy. Surgical techniques for hepatic resection and results for local ablation, regional chemotherapy into the hepatic artery, RT, and management of the primary tumor in patients who present with stage IV disease are addressed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical local treatment strategies for colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-resection-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic resection techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-portal-vein-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative portal vein embolization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locoregional methods for management and palliation in patients who present with stage IV colorectal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H6299256\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Local treatment for patients with synchronous liver metastases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOPSY CONFIRMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A biopsy may be indicated to confirm the diagnosis, depending upon the clinical picture. The risk of tract seeding from percutaneous fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy appears small (only a handful of case reports are described in journals listed in Medline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]), although this complication was described in 5 of 51 cases of biopsy-proven hepatic colorectal metastases in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Needle tract seeding more often complicates FNA biopsy of primary liver tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During laparotomy or laparoscopy for colectomy, if confirmation of liver metastases is clinically indicated, needle biopsy should be performed rather than incising into a tumor with a scalpel or with biopsy forceps to minimize the risk of peritoneal seeding. In patients with multiple suspicious liver lesions, biopsy of a single lesion to confirm the presence of metastases is generally sufficient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resection offers the greatest likelihood of cure for patients with liver-isolated colorectal cancer (CRC). In surgical case series, five-year survival rates after resection range from 24 to 58 percent, averaging 40 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74509 \">table 1</a>), and surgical mortality rates are generally &lt;5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/3-5,7-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7-18</a>]. Subgroups with advanced age, comorbid disease, and synchronous hepatic and colon resection may have higher procedure-related mortality and worse long-term outcomes. As an example, five-year survival rate was only 25 percent in a population-based retrospective report of 3957 US Medicare enrollees undergoing hepatic resection for CRC liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Even so, five-year survival rates with the most active systemic chemotherapy regimens are only 10 to 11 percent, only about one-fifth of whom have a sustained disease remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles#H183911606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: General principles&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy versus supportive care'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately one-third of five-year survivors suffer a cancer-related death, while those who survive 10 years appear to be cured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In an analysis of 612 consecutive patients who underwent resection of CRC liver metastases and were followed for at least 10 years, there were 102 actual 10-year survivors (17 percent), and only one patient experienced a disease-specific death after 10 years of survival.</p><p>Because of its clear survival impact, surgical resection is the treatment of choice when feasible. The percentage of patients with isolated hepatic metastases who are amenable to potentially curative resection is a bit of a moving target since surgeons may have different interpretations of &quot;resectable.&quot; It is safe to say that a majority of patients, with metastatic disease are not curative surgical candidates because of tumor size, location, multifocality, or inadequate hepatic reserve.</p><p>Some patients with initially unresectable disease may become resectable after induction chemotherapy. While this is commonly stated, probably no more than 5 to 15 percent of patients fall into this category when an assessment of resectability is done initially by a liver surgeon. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Updated guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2483\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> suggest that patients who appear to have initially unresectable metastatic CRC be categorized as potentially convertible or unconvertible. Patients whose disease is felt to be unconvertible should be referred for alternative treatment (most often palliative chemotherapy), while induction chemotherapy is appropriate for those whose disease is potentially convertible. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal selection of patients for hepatic resection is evolving, and the criteria for resectability differ among individual liver surgeons regarding borderline cases, from center to center and from country to country. One consensus statement defined absolute unresectability as non-treatable extrahepatic disease, unfitness for surgery, or involvement of more than 70 percent of the liver or six segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Conversion therapy for initially unresectable metastases'</a> below.)</p><p>Risk scoring systems (such as the clinical risk score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/7,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24,25</a>]) to predict which patients with metastatic CRC are most likely to benefit from resection are of limited clinical utility; none has sufficient discriminatory ability to accurately predict disease-specific survival at all time points following resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Utility is particularly uncertain among patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Whether changes in the clinical risk score after treatment translates into improved outcomes after resection is unknown (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Conversion therapy for initially unresectable metastases'</a> below). Not enough is yet known about the prognostic value of molecular markers in patients being considered for resection of metastatic disease in the liver, but it is possible, if not likely, that certain biomarkers will be identified that may reflect either more or fewer reasons to consider metastasectomy.</p><p>Modern multidisciplinary consensus defines resectable CRC liver metastases simply as tumors that can be resected completely, leaving an adequate liver remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. For resection to be considered, most surgeons would require that there be no radiographic evidence of involvement of the hepatic artery, major bile ducts, main portal vein, or <span class=\"nowrap\">celiac/paraaortic</span> lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and adequate predicted functional hepatic reserve postresection. Preoperative liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative ultrasound offer the optimal assessment of the number, size, and proximity of tumors to key vascular and biliary structures. Complete resection must be feasible. There should be no unresectable extrahepatic sites of disease, and the primary tumor should have been resected for cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Concurrent resection of hepatic and extrahepatic disease in well-selected patients is associated with a possibility of long-term survival, particularly if the extrahepatic disease is surgically resectable lung or ovarian metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In the past, contraindications to liver resection were defined by retrospective series and recapitulated in a large multi-institutional review of 856 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Based upon these analyses, surgeons have been reluctant to offer resection to patients with more than three lesions, those with bilobar distribution (ie, tumor involving any segments of the left and right hemi-liver), those in whom it was not possible to achieve 1 cm margins, patients with portal lymph node or other extrahepatic metastases, and those with liver metastases from cancers other than colorectal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>However, these relative contraindications have been challenged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With safer surgery and better chemotherapy, hepatic resection is playing an increasing role in patients with multiple, even bilobar tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/36-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-43</a>] (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Therapy after resection of liver metastases'</a> below). As an example, in a report of 484 patients with multiple metastases (136 with &ge;4, 36 with &ge;8) 5-and 10-year survival was 47 and 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Even patients with &ge;8 metastases had a five-year survival rate of 24 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A two-stage approach to hepatic resection may be needed in the presence of multiple bilobar metastases.

However, advances in surgical equipment and adjunctive intraoperative ablative techniques have led multiple groups to revisit this 10 mm requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], and their findings have altered the algorithm for management of CRC liver metastases. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection#H29898048\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;, section on 'Resection margins'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the classic contraindications to hepatectomy is the presence of portal lymph node metastases, thought to indicate systemic disease that could not be successfully treated surgically. This view has been challenged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/31,46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,46-49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A major problem is the prediction of metastatic lymph nodes in the hepatic pedicle in patients with CRC liver metastases. In one analysis, the positive predictive value (PPV) of preoperative CT was only 56 percent, and even intraoperative evaluation had a PPV of only 43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Accurate oncologic assessment requires systematic pedicular lymph node clearance, although this maneuver is not known to be of any therapeutic value.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of portal node metastases is not inevitably associated with distant metastases. Jaeck et al reported outcomes of complete hepatic pedicle lymphadenectomy in patients with CRC liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Nineteen percent of patients survived three years despite portal node metastases. Outcome was more favorable if nodal involvement was limited to the porta as compared with along the common hepatic artery (three-year survival 38 versus 0 percent, respectively). An important caveat is that this was a retrospective review of highly selected patients who did not have enlarged portal nodes detected preoperatively. Whether this principle can be extrapolated to patients with grossly enlarged nodes is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, the presence of other sites of limited extrahepatic metastases (particularly lung) should not be considered a contraindication to resection as long as the disease is amenable to complete extirpation. However, outcomes in this group are not as favorable, particularly when there are &gt;6 liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

However, until additional data are available, including long-term follow-up of the Canadian trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], we agree with guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2483\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>, which recommend a staging PET scan for patients who appear to have potentially surgically curable metastatic CRC. An important caveat is that PET can be unreliable in this setting, especially after chemotherapy, since changes in tumor metabolism may be induced by chemotherapy but the cancer may remain viable.</p><p>At least in theory, whole body PET scans have the potential to identify radiographically occult extrahepatic disease and optimize the selection of appropriate candidates for hepatic resection, mainly by reducing nontherapeutic laparotomy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/3,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,53-55</a>]. However, the data supporting a benefit for PET in this setting are mixed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of adding PET to the staging strategy was subsequently shown in a randomized trial in which 150 patients with CRC liver metastases selected for hepatic resection by CT were randomly assigned to triple-phase contrast-enhanced CT imaging only or CT plus a separate PET scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The primary outcome measure was the number of futile laparotomies (any laparotomy that did not result in complete tumor treatment or that did not result in a disease-free survival period of at least six months). The addition of PET significantly reduced the number of futile surgeries (28 versus 45 percent) and prevented unnecessary surgery in one of every six patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two caveats must be considered when interpreting these results. First, this study used separate contrast-enhanced CT and PET images and not the increasingly popular integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging, in which both PET and CT are performed sequentially during a single visit on a hybrid <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanner. The CT component of integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging is performed in most institutions without the use of intravenous contrast material, which compromises the detection of small metastases both within and outside of the liver. At some institutions, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is carried out with intravenous contrast, but this practice is not widespread.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A benefit for integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> could not be confirmed in a later randomized trial in which 404 patients with potentially resectable isolated CRC liver metastases (as established by contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis within 30 days of randomization) were randomly assigned to preoperative integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> or no <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Of the 263 patients who underwent preoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> only 21 (8 percent) had a change in surgical management; these included seven (2.7 percent) who did not undergo laparotomy, four who had more extensive hepatic surgery, and nine (3.4 percent) who had additional organ surgery. Liver resection was performed in a similar proportion of both groups (91 versus 92 percent of the control group), and at a median follow-up of 36 months, survival did not differ among the groups (two-year survival 80 percent in both groups).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superiority of PET over CT alone for detection of extrahepatic disease was also suggested in a systematic overview of retrospective data, which utilized a scoring system to weigh the individual studies according to the quality of the data and the clinical impact of the radiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. For the six articles judged to be of the highest quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/57-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-62</a>], the pooled sensitivity and specificity for PET were 80 and 92 percent, respectively, for hepatic disease, and 91 and 98 percent, respectively, for extrahepatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The corresponding values for CT were 83 and 84 percent, respectively, for hepatic metastases, and 61 and 91 percent, respectively, for extrahepatic metastases. The percent change in clinical management from the performance of PET ranged from 20 to 32 percent (average 25 percent).</p><p/><p>The results of restaging PET scans (particularly if negative) must be interpreted in the context of recent therapy. Chemotherapy may reduce the sensitivity of PET for the detection of liver metastases, thought due to decreased cellular metabolic activity following chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. In one study, the false-negative rate for hepatic metastases of a PET scan performed within four weeks of chemotherapy was 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Overall, 83 percent of patients were successfully resected, similar to the number who were successfully resected in the surgery alone group (84 percent). Thus, the fear that initial chemotherapy would cause resectable liver metastases to become unresectable was not realized in this study. Furthermore, initial chemotherapy improved patient selection for hepatic resection. Among those undergoing upfront surgery, 18 of 170 (11 percent) had a nontherapeutic laparotomy, compared with only 8 of 159 (5 percent) in the initial chemotherapy group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The postoperative complication rate was significantly higher in the chemotherapy group (25 versus 16 percent).

PVE elicits a hypertrophic physiologic response in the nonembolized portion, augmenting the volume and, potentially, the function of the future liver remnant to a safe threshold to permit potentially curative liver resection. For patients undergoing preoperative PVE, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be continued while awaiting hypertrophy as this practice significantly reduces rates of hepatic tumor progression and does not inhibit liver hypertrophy.

This was shown in a collective series of 436 patients undergoing macroscopically complete, potentially curative resection for CRC liver metastases at three institutions; 234 were microscopically complete (R0), while 202 had microscopically positive margins (R1 resection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].

Furthermore, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were not dissimilar between the two groups (61 and 43 percent in the R0 group, versus 57 and 37 percent in the R1 group). In multivariate analysis, preoperative CEA level and major hepatectomy (&ge;3 segments) but not R1 resection were independent predictors of poor outcome.</p><p>These data support the view that the inability to obtain clear resection margins is not necessarily a strict contraindication to resection of liver metastases (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above). However, a complete (R0) resection must always be the goal of any resection.

Some reports indicate a poor prognosis in such patients, at least in part attributable to the failure to resect clinically occult micrometastatic liver disease. In theory, delaying hepatic surgery by three to six months would permit the biological behavior of the metastatic disease to become evident, thus improving the selection of patients for whom hepatic metastasectomy might be curative. Delayed resection does not seem to increase the risk of patients becoming unresectable due to growth of the initial metastases, although if patients are untreated during this interval, it can increase the volume of resected liver, a significant predictor of postoperative complications.</p><p>One potential solution is to perform percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) during the interval between diagnosis and hepatic metastasectomy. A more commonly used approach is to administer chemotherapy during this period, which might also allow some patients with initially unresectable or borderline resectable liver metastases to undergo successful later hepatic resection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-local-treatment-strategies-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical local treatment strategies for colorectal cancer liver metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Simultaneous resection of the primary and metastatic disease is clearly preferable from the patient's perspective, and several surgical case series and meta-analyses have failed to confirm inferior survival or greater morbidity for patients who undergo a one-stage procedure as compared with delayed (staged) hepatic resection, unless major hepatic resection (three or more segments) is needed. One-stage surgery is probably a reasonable option for patients who present with low-volume (four or fewer, less than three segments involved, or all in the same lobe) potentially resectable hepatic metastases. Because of the incidence of synchronous second primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) (approximately 3 to 5 percent), complete colonoscopy prior to surgical resection should be undertaken, if feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surveillance-after-colorectal-cancer-resection#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surveillance after colorectal cancer resection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosing second cancers and polyps'</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, if there are five or more simultaneous potentially resectable hepatic metastases (unless all are located in one lobe), bilobar involvement, or if disease is borderline resectable due to location, initial chemotherapy followed by reassessment and delayed resection is probably a better strategy.

The experience with that study reflects the reasons that HIA chemotherapy after liver resection has not gained widespread acceptance. The concern that pump placement increases the complexity of the operation, and that surgical complications and the hepatobiliary toxicity of FUDR delivered by HIA may compromise the high response rates with modern systemic chemotherapy regimens limits the use of HIA chemotherapy after hepatic resection.

The rationale is based upon the observation that in contrast to clinically detectable metastases, which derive 90 percent of their blood supply from the hepatic artery, hepatic micrometastases (as well as the biliary tree) are primarily dependent on the portal vein for their blood supply.

Systemic administration of FU and LV was given in conjunction with PVI FUDR, which was administered for 14 days on and 14 days off at a dose approximately twofold higher than that used with HIA FUDR. Although there was a low incidence of hepatic drug-induced toxicity, overall and disease-free survival (at three years 42 and 19 percent, respectively) were somewhat lower than has been reported with HIA FUDR and systemic FU plus LV following resection of hepatic metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/151,152\" class=\"abstract_t\">151,152</a>].

For appropriately selected patients with four or fewer metastases, five-year relapse-free survival rates average 30 percent; in at least four contemporary series, five-year overall survival rates are approximately 58 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal selection of patients for resection, particularly the utility of preoperative integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT), is evolving. Since the criteria for potential liver-directed therapies have been expanded, hepatic surgical consultation should be obtained for surgically-fit patients with apparently isolated liver metastases unless they fall into one of the following categories (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radiographic evidence of involvement of the common hepatic artery, common hepatic or common bile duct, or main portal vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive liver involvement (&gt;70 percent, more than six segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>), or involvement of all three hepatic veins)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inadequate predicted postresection functional hepatic reserve</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in selecting optimal surgical candidates is uncertain. However, until additional data are available, including long-term follow-up of the Canadian trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], we agree with guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2483\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a>, which recommend a staging PET scan for patients who appear to have potentially surgically curable metastatic CRC. An important caveat is that PET can be unreliable in this setting, especially after chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'PET scans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using a clinical risk score to select patients for diagnostic laparoscopy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We perform an initial diagnostic laparoscopy only in patients with a suspicion of low-volume carcinomatosis based on preoperative radiographic imaging and for selected other cases at high risk for intraperitoneal metastatic disease (eg, a patient with a metachronous presentation of the primary and metastases who has several liver metastases that are not responding to chemotherapy). (See <a href=\"#H14008586\" class=\"local\">'Selecting patients for diagnostic laparoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the hepatic metastases are potentially resectable, we suggest immediate surgical resection rather than initial chemotherapy for medically fit patients with four or fewer metastases, unless a response to chemotherapy is anticipated to allow for a significantly less complex resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with a good performance status who have more than four metastases (unless all are localized to a single lobe), radiographic suspicion for portal node involvement, or bilobar disease (ie, tumor involving any segments of the left and right hemi-liver), we suggest initial systemic chemotherapy followed by surgical reevaluation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5842004\" class=\"local\">'Initially resectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Others disagree, instead recommending two to three courses of preoperative chemotherapy in all patients with potentially resectable liver metastases, in part to select those patients who are most likely to benefit from resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. However, if preoperative chemotherapy is selected, the number of courses should be minimized. Radiographic response assessment should be performed at six week intervals, and surgery undertaken as soon as the metastases are clearly resectable. (See <a href=\"#H5842613\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy-related liver toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal chemotherapy regimen is not established. We consider the following combinations to represent reasonable choices: FOLFOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 7</a>), FOLFOXIRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70559 \">table 6</a>), or FOLFIRI plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64504 \">table 4</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panitumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">panitumumab</a> (for patients with left-sided tumors lacking RAS and BRAF mutations).

Furthermore, longer durations of preoperative chemotherapy increase the potential for liver toxicity and postoperative complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If it is attempted, the optimal regimen for conversion therapy in this setting is not established. Given the potential for treatment-related toxicity with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> and the modest improvement in overall response rate when this agent is added to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, we prefer an oxaliplatin-based systemic combination regimen without bevacizumab, or FOLFOXIRI (for young healthy patients who are able to tolerate it). For patients with metachronous metastases who have received adjuvant FOLFOX in the preceding 12 months, FOLFIRI with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panitumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">panitumumab</a> (for left sided tumors lacking <span class=\"nowrap\">RAS/BRAF</span> mutations) is a reasonable option.

Updated, consensus-based guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest a cytotoxic chemotherapy doublet (either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) or FOLFOXIRI for those with RAS mutant disease, and a cytotoxic doublet (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX) plus an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody for those with RAS wild type disease, although the combination of FOLFOXIRI plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> could also be considered in this situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-potentially-resectable-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastases/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].
