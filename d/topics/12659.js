HF may be caused by disease of the myocardium, pericardium, endocardium, heart valves, vessels, or by metabolic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HF due to left ventricular dysfunction is categorized according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into HF with reduced ejection fraction (with LVEF &le;40 percent, known as HFrEF; also referred to as systolic HF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (with LVEF &gt;50 percent; known as HFpEF; also referred to as diastolic HF). </p><p>An overview of the management of chronic HFrEF will be presented here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

In addition, hypertension imposes an increased hemodynamic load on the failing ventricle in patients with established HF due to any etiology. The goals of therapy are to control blood pressure and to reduce left ventricular afterload, thereby improving cardiac function and decreasing the progression of pathologic remodeling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361645280\"><span class=\"h4\">General management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with HFrEF and hypertension, a beta blocker; an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI); and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) are the preferred antihypertensive agents because these agents improve survival in patients with HFrEF, as discussed below. Beta blockers can also provide anginal relief in patients with ischemic heart disease and rate control in those with atrial fibrillation. </p><p>For patients who are still hypertensive after optimization of treatment with a beta blocker, an ACE inhibitor (or ARB or ARNI), and an MRA (if indicated) or who cannot tolerate these drugs, appropriate agents include loop diuretics, nitrates, some vasoselective calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>.
