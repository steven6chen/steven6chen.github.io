Since histologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is not necessary in most cases, and there is both growth and regression of fibroids, asymptomatic uterine leiomyomas can usually be followed without intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women with leiomyomas whose physicians prescribed &quot;watchful waiting&quot; experienced no significant change in symptoms or decline in quality of life, thereby providing some reassurance to women who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and choose to avoid intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Moreover, evidence-based guidelines support not treating asymptomatic fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>Prophylactic therapy to avoid potential future complications from myomas or their treatment is not recommended because we don&rsquo;t have reliable predictors of progression. Possible exceptions include women with significant submucosal leiomyomas who are contemplating pregnancy and women with ureteral compression leading to moderate or severe hydronephrosis. In these women, prophylactic treatment may prevent miscarriage or urinary tract obstruction.</p><p>Relief of symptoms (eg, abnormal uterine bleeding, pain, pressure) is the major goal in management of women with significant symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The type and timing of any intervention should be individualized, based upon factors such as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type and severity of symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size of the myoma(s)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of the myoma(s)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reproductive plans and obstetrical history</p><p/><p>An overview of the treatment of uterine leiomyomas will be presented here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of these tumors are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no high quality data regarding follow-up of fibroids in patients who are asymptomatic or who decline medical or surgical treatment. However, given data that fibroids can shrink substantially and that there is substantial regression during the postpartum period and during menopause, expectant management appears to be a reasonable option for some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. We order an initial imaging study (usually an ultrasound) to confirm that a pelvic mass is a fibroid and not an ovarian or other pelvic mass. After an initial evaluation, we perform annual pelvic exams and, in patients with anemia or heavy menstrual bleeding, check a complete blood count. If symptoms or uterine size are increasing, we proceed with further evaluation and patient counseling regarding treatment options. We also screen women with heavy menstrual bleeding for hypothyroidism, a disease that is common in reproductive age women, and refer women with heavy menstrual bleeding and a history suggestive of a bleeding disorder for hematologic evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive evidence-based report noted &quot;a remarkable lack of randomized trial data demonstrating the effectiveness of medical therapies in the management of women with symptomatic fibroids&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Given the high prevalence of both leiomyomas and the use of gonadal steroid preparations (eg, contraception, management of menstrual cycle abnormalities), it is difficult to isolate the effect of these drugs on mild leiomyoma-related symptoms.</p><p>Anecdotal data suggest medical therapy provides adequate symptom relief in some women, primarily in situations where bleeding is the dominant or only symptom. In general, 75 percent of women get some improvement over one year of therapy, but long-term failure rates are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A systematic review observed that in trials where women were randomly assigned to oral medical therapy, almost 60 percent had undergone surgery by two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A trial of medical therapy in premenopausal women with mild symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mildly enlarged uteri can also be useful for helping to distinguish symptoms primarily related to leiomyomas from those primarily due to a concurrent problem, such as oligoovulation, which may be contributing to abnormal uterine bleeding or infertility. However, in postmenopausal women, caution should be exercised when raising the level of steroid hormones from the physiologic baseline, as there is indirect evidence that taking hormone therapy causes leiomyomas to grow in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined hormonal contraceptives and progestational agents are commonly prescribed to regulate abnormal uterine bleeding, but appear to have limited efficacy in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. These drugs can be useful in some women with heavy menstrual bleeding, particularly those with coexisting problems (eg, dysmenorrhea or oligoovulation); but they do not appear to be effective in decreasing bulk symptoms. There is also evidence that, in some women, contraceptive steroids may be associated with a decreased risk of uterine fibroids; however, it is not clear that these agents are useful for either primary or secondary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. There is one study that suggests that oral contraceptives started before age 16 may be associated with an increased risk of fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A large study of commercially insured United States women with fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding who initiated medical therapy showed that almost 80 percent were started on short acting hormonal contraceptives (SARCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, women who were started on long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) including progestin implants, injections and IUDs were less like to discontinue or switch medications compared to women using SARCs as first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Steroid hormones influence the pathogenesis of leiomyomas, but the relationship is complex. As an example, although there are high levels of both estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy and with estrogen-progestin contraceptive use, both decrease the risk of developing new leiomyomas but may lead to leiomyoma growth. The specific hormonal compound, the timing and duration of exposure, the delivery method (endogenous, oral, transdermal, depot, local) and other factors may all be important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen-progestin contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some texts continue to suggest that estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills (OC) are contraindicated in women with uterine leiomyomas. However, clinical experience suggests some women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with leiomyomas respond to OC therapy. This, plus data that OCs are associated with a decreased risk of leiomyomas and reduced symptoms from other concurrent gynecologic conditions, suggests that a therapeutic trial may be appropriate before proceeding to more invasive therapies. The purported mechanism of action is via endometrial atrophy.</p><p>This approach should be reassessed if a woman has exacerbation of bulk-related symptoms on OCs. Since most formulations appear to work similarly, switching to other formulations does not appear to be effective in the woman who does not respond to a three- to six-month trial of one formulation.</p><p>Data are not available regarding treatment using newer methods of contraceptive steroid delivery (eg, ring, patch). However, with vaginal administration (NuvaRing), the uterus is likely to receive a higher dose of medication than other systemic tissues, which could affect how leiomyomas respond to hormone therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials evaluating the use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine leiomyomas. Observational studies and systematic reviews have shown a reduction in uterine volume and bleeding, and an increase in hematocrit after placement of this IUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/11,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21-24</a>]. The device is widely used for control of heavy menstrual bleeding and is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication. A second advantage of this treatment is that it provides contraception for women who do not desire pregnancy. The presence of intracavitary leiomyomas amenable to hysteroscopic resection is a strong relative contraindication to use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Progestin implants, injections, and pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with combination OCs, there are no data to discern the effectiveness of progestin-only contraceptive steroids specifically for treatment of leiomyomas. As with the breast, progesterone is a growth factor for myomas and may even be more critical than estrogen. That being said, progestin-only contraceptives cause endometrial atrophy and thus provide relief of menstrual bleeding-related symptoms. They can be considered for treatment of mild symptoms, especially for women who need contraception. There is also consistent evidence from cohort studies that these agents are associated with a decreased risk of leiomyoma formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/19,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25</a>].</p><p>In contrast to gonadotropin-releasing agonists and antagonists, most of these &quot;contraceptives&quot; provide continuous exposure to low doses of hormones, which should minimize deleterious effects. (See <a href=\"#H2371032558\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1250705500\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists'</a> below.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Progesterone receptor modulators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs that modulate progesterone are increasingly used as first line medical treatment of fibroids. None, however, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and available in the US. They have the advantage of oral administration and minimal symptomatic side effects. The major concern is whether there are endometrial effects with long-term continuous use. Thus, most are administered intermittently with endometrial shedding between treatment cycles.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials including 1021 women evaluated progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs) compared with placebo or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a>, a GnRH-agonist for uterine fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. PRMs showed modest reduction in MBL compared with placebo (three trials; standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.11 mL, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.83) and significant improvements in fibroid symptom severity and health-related quality of life. The analysis include two trials comparing PRMs with leuprolide, but the data were insufficient to find differences in MBL or symptoms. One of these trials (n = 501) was subsequently fully published, and found that three months of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> (10 or 25mg) was as effective as leuprolide (3.75 mg) based on the reduction in volume of the largest leiomyoma (mifepristone: 40 to 43 percent versus leuprolide: 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Mifepristone was better tolerated than leuprolide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24356925\"><span class=\"h4\">Ulipristal acetate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ulipristal</a> acetate is a PRM that is approved outside the United States both for three months of preoperative therapy and short intermittent courses interrupted by menstruation (European Conformity [CE mark] and Canadian drug authority). Ulipristal acetate (oral, 5 and 10 mg once daily for 13 weeks) was compared with placebo in one randomized trial of 242 women with heavy menstrual bleeding, fibroid-associated anemia, and a uterus that was &le;16 weeks of gestation size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Ulipristal acetate resulted in a significantly higher rate of resolution of menorrhagia (5 mg: 91 percent; 10 mg: 92 percent; placebo: 19 percent) and a significant, but only slightly higher increase in hemoglobin (5 mg: 4.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dl;</span> 10 mg: 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dl;</span> placebo: 3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dl)</span>. Significant reductions in fibroid volume occurred in women treated with ulipristal acetate (5 mg: -21 percent volume; 10 mg: -12 percent; placebo: +3 percent). There were no findings of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. Approximately half of patients in each group chose to undergo surgical treatment of fibroids at the completion of the study.</p><p>Another randomized trial by the same group included 307 women with menorrhagia and a uterus that was &le;16 weeks of gestation size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Participants were assigned to 13 weeks of therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> acetate (oral, 5 mg or 10 mg per day) or the GnRH-agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate (intramuscular, 3.75 mg monthly).&nbsp;All groups had comparable rates of resolution of menorrhagia. Resolution of menorrhagia was achieved more quickly in the ulipristal groups (approximately six days compared with 30 days for leuprolide). Women treated with ulipristal had a significantly lower frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes (in the ulipristal acetate groups, 5 mg: 11 percent; 10 mg: 10 percent versus leuprolide: 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The reduction in uterine size was significantly lower for the ulipristal groups (5 mg: 20 percent; 10 mg: 22 percent; leuprolide: 47 percent). </p><p>Finally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> acetate use has been reported for up to four three-month courses separated by a spontaneous withdrawal menstrual flow or one brought on by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There were no differences in outcomes following norethindrone except that menses resumed more quickly (15 rather than 30 days) and bleeding scores were statistically reduced at the end of the trial, although bleeding was reduced in both groups at the end of four cycles. There were no cases of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in either group. There appeared to be a cumulative volume reduction in women remaining in the study. However, half of the subjects did not complete the four cycles.</p><p>Some leaders in the field are advocating for use of PRMs as a first-line therapy in all fibroids except FIGO type 0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, no national or society guidelines currently support this approach. The approved dose in 5 mg daily. </p><p>Trials are ongoing of this agent and other PRMs in the United States. The available dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> in the United States is an impediment to off-label treatment. Ulipristal acetate is sold in the United States as a single 30 mg dose, as opposed to 5 mg per day approved for fibroid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29821201\"><span class=\"h4\">Mifepristone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiprogestin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> (RU-486) is the most widely studied PRM and reduces uterine volume by 26 to 74 percent in women with leiomyomas, comparable to the reduction observed with GnRH agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, it is not currently approved for fibroid use. Regrowth occurs slowly following cessation of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Data from randomized trials and prospective studies have shown that high dose regimens (&gt;10 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> give comparable rates of amenorrhea to GnRH agonists, while lower doses (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> achieve an amenorrhea rate of 40 to 70 percent and, in other women, produce a reduction in menstrual flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-38</a>]. There is accumulating evidence that mifepristone provides symptomatic relief and improved quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. There is also a small randomized clinical trial utilizing the PRM CDB-2914 and a pilot study utilizing asoprisnil, both of which may have similar effects to mifepristone for leiomyoma treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mifepristone</a> is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of uterine myomas. As with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> acetate, an impediment to use of mifepristone for treatment of leiomyomas is that currently available doses are not appropriate (200 mg once for termination of pregnancy versus 5 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for three to six months for myoma reduction). Use of a compounding pharmacy is required and many are reluctant to provide this compound due to political, rather than medical, concerns for this off-label treatment indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>An expert panel of pathologists, convened by the United States National Institutes of Health, reported that a novel pattern of changes that resemble hyperplasia is found in endometrial tissue following treatment with PRMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. They term this new pattern PRM-associated endometrial changes and suggest that long-term follow-up is indicated to define the natural history of these changes. Recent molecular studies suggest that endometrium exposed to PRMs do not appear to express the typical molecular signatures of endometrial malignant progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Another potential complication of these agents is transient elevations in serum aminotransferases, which has been reported with high dose regimens; this appears to be a rare occurrence with low dose regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2049264184\"><span class=\"h4\">Endometrial changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A unique pattern of endometrial changes has been observed following treatment with PRMs termed &quot;progesterone receptor modulator-associated endometrial changes&quot; (PAECs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/28,42,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,42,44-46</a>]. The most common histologic finding observed in women taking PRMs is cystic glandular dilatation, with both estrogen and progestin epithelial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In some cases, the endometrial histology had been interpreted erroneously as showing hyperplasia; true endometrial hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia have not been observed following PRM therapy, and no woman has developed endometrial carcinoma.</p><p>The clinician detecting endometrial thickening in women treated with PRMs should be aware that the cystic glandular dilatation produces the endometrial thickening and that the histological changes do not represent endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial thickening has been detected on ultrasound as early as three months after doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> ranging from 5 to 10 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

In addition, rare instances of breakthrough bleeding have occurred when treatment with PRMs exceeds four months. Breakthrough bleeding is usually, but not always, associated with endometrial thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371032558\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are the most effective medical therapy for uterine myomas. These drugs work by initially increasing the release of gonadotropins, followed by desensitization and downregulation to a hypogonadotropic, hypogonadal state that clinically resembles menopause. Most women will develop amenorrhea, improvement in anemia (if present), and a significant reduction (35 to 60 percent) in uterine size within three months of initiating this therapy, thus achieving improvement in both categories of myoma symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16,17,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,50</a>].</p><p>However, there is rapid resumption of menses and pretreatment uterine volume after discontinuation of GnRH agonists. In addition, significant symptoms can result from the severe hypoestrogenism that accompanies such therapy, including hot flashes, sleep disturbance, vaginal dryness, myalgias and arthralgias, and possible impairment of mood and cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Bone loss leading to osteoporosis after long-term (12+ months) use is the most serious complication and most often limits therapy. A rule of thumb for women with endometriosis is that approximately 6 percent of bone is lost over 12 months of therapy and 3 percent is regained following the cessation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, women with leiomyomas tend to be older and heavier than women with endometriosis, thus they may have less bone loss.</p><p>Because of the rapid rebound in symptoms and side effects, GnRH agonists are primarily used selectively as preoperative therapy. GnRH agonists are approved for administration for three to six months prior to leiomyoma-related surgery in conjunction with iron supplementation to facilitate the procedure and enable correction of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Reduction in uterine size can facilitate subsequent surgery by reducing intraoperative blood loss and by increasing the number of women who are candidates for a vaginal procedure, a transverse (rather than vertical) abdominal incision, or a minimally-invasive procedure. Since oral iron supplementation alone will improve the preoperative hematocrit in a significant number of patients, the cost and adverse effects of GnRH agonists must be weighed against their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Although some clinicians reflexively plan three or six months of treatment, interval assessment of goals is optimal because of the variability of response. Continuing GnRH agonist for six months prior to abdominal myomectomy to effect volume reduction is not optimal treatment if there is no volume reduction by two to three months. Likewise, treatment of a 2.8 cm submucous leiomyoma prior to surgery is not helpful if the hysteroscopic surgeon can easily resect a 3 cm leiomyoma.</p><p>The side effects of long-term GnRH agonist administration can be minimized during therapy by giving add-back therapy with low dose estrogen-progestin after the initial phase of downregulation. A phase of downregulation is necessary to achieve shrinkage of leiomyomas even though simultaneous administration of a GnRH agonist and steroids can work for other diseases, such as endometriosis. Low dose estrogen-progestin therapy, such as used for menopausal replacement (equivalent to 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen and 2.5 of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> or 5 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate) maintains amenorrhea and the reduction in uterine volume, while preventing significant hypoestrogenic side effects (eg, osteoporosis, vasomotor symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Using OC add-back for leiomyomas is not indicated.</p><p>Rarely, GnRH-agonists are used to provide short-term relief to women close to menopause or with acute medical contraindications to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The FDA has approved use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> and iron preoperatively in women with leiomyomas, but not for medical management of these tumors.

However, the fact that these agents are best administered at specific times in the menstrual cycle (late luteal if no chance of pregnancy or with onset of menses), cause an increase in estrogen prior to downregulation and take a minimum of three weeks to reach this down-regulated state means that some women who might benefit are not candidates for therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1250705500\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar clinical results have been achieved with GnRH antagonists, which compete with endogenous GnRH for pituitary binding sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>].

According to a survey, MRgFUS practitioners consider a fibroid &gt;10 cm to be somewhat of an impediment, but not an absolute contraindication to the procedure. Factors reported as the most important contraindications included severe adenomyosis, five or more fibroids, and nonenhancement with gadolinium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Further study is needed to determine the optimal fibroid size threshold for MRgFUS. It appears that MRgFUS results in a reduction in myoma volume of approximately 37 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. </p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging gives good visualization of the anatomic structures and provides real-time thermal monitoring to optimize tissue destruction. Symptomatic improvement is observed within the first three months postprocedure, and this improvement has been maintained at least through 24 to 36 months follow-up, with more complete ablation leading to better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/111-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-115</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Expectant management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal women</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of postmenopausal hormonal therapy, leiomyomas generally become smaller and asymptomatic in postmenopausal women; therefore, intervention is not usually indicated. We suggest evaluation to exclude sarcoma in a postmenopausal woman with a new or enlarging pelvic mass (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The incidence of sarcoma is 1 to 2 percent in women with a new or enlarging pelvic mass, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Submucosal leiomyomas</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend hysteroscopic myomectomy for women with appropriate submucosal leiomyomas that are symptomatic (eg, bleeding, miscarriage) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). This procedure allows future childbearing, usually without compromising the integrity of the myometrium, but is also an appropriate option in women who have completed childbearing since it is minimally invasive. Abdominal myomectomy is performed in women with significant symptoms and a submucous leiomyoma(s) not amenable to hysteroscopic resection. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Myomectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Premenopausal women</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Women who desire fertility</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the lack of information about the safety of pregnancy after other invasive procedures, we recommend abdominal myomectomy for treatment of symptomatic intramural and subserosal leiomyomas in women who wish to preserve their childbearing potential and who have no major contraindications to a surgical approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the preferred approach to submucosal leiomyomas. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Myomectomy'</a> above.)<br/><br/>However, for women for whom risk of intraoperative conversion to hysterectomy is high, or women who are considering a future pregnancy but will accept impaired fertility in exchange for an expedited recovery phase, other options such as uterine artery embolization and magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound may be considered appropriate treatment options. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Uterine artery embolization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Laparoscopic myomectomy is an option for women with a uterus less than 17 weeks' size or with a small number of subserosal or intramural leiomyomas. Future childbearing is possible; however, the integrity of the uterine incision during pregnancy has not been evaluated adequately and may be inferior to abdominal myomectomy. Due to reports of uterine rupture in pregnancy following some laparoscopic myomectomies, surgeons should discuss the risks and benefits of each option with patients, including possible risk of uterine rupture, as well as provide information regarding their experience with laparoscopic suturing. While robotic assistance may alleviate these problems, there are currently little data to support this contention.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Women who do not desire fertility</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy is the definitive procedure for relief of symptoms and prevention of recurrent leiomyoma-related problems. However, even women who do not desire fertility may have adequate symptom relief with alternatives to hysterectomy if they are close to menopause. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hysterectomy'</a> above.)<br/><br/>We suggest use of GnRH agonists prior to a potentially complicated hysterectomy (or myomectomy) if the surgeon feels reduction in <span class=\"nowrap\">uterine/myoma</span> volume will significantly facilitate the procedure or if there is significant anemia which has not responded to iron therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2371032558\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with abnormal uterine bleeding related to leiomyomas who wish to undergo the least invasive procedure, we suggest a trial of placement of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraception over other drug therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). PRMs may also be a first line measure where they are available. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several less invasive options, both surgical and using interventional radiology, are available to symptomatic women (bleeding, pain, pressure) who have completed childbearing but wish to retain their uterus. There is no high-quality evidence to recommend one procedure over another. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Interventional radiology'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Since fertility and pregnancy outcome may be adversely affected after many of these procedures, we suggest not performing these procedures (other than myomectomy) for women wishing to optimize future pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-treatment-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Parker WH.
