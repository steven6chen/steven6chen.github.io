Myelomeningocele (spina bifida) is the most common NTD. It is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed. Patients with myelomeningocele may have weakness and absence of sensation affecting the lower extremities and <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/bladder</span> dysfunction, depending upon the level of the spinal lesion.</p><p>An overview of the management of myelomeningocele and its complications will be presented here.

Historically, selective treatment was provided only for infants considered to have the best chance of neurologic outcome; however, nonselective treatment increases overall survival several fold, and there is little difference in functionality as compared with individuals surviving selective treatment protocols. (See <a href=\"#H4200177449\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>At our institution, the management choice is dependent on parent preference after ensuring that parents understand the management options and expected outcomes. During prenatal counseling, discussion with the parents includes the natural history of myelomeningocele and the prenatal management decisions, including termination of the pregnancy, pursuit of additional prenatal testing, choice of delivery setting, and, when applicable, the possibility of fetal surgery. The postnatal management choices are also discussed, including surgical closure of the defect and possible need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Longitudinal follow-up after prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele suggests that approximately 60 to 70 percent of pregnancies end in termination or fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Serial ultrasounds for fetal growth, head size, and ventricular size can provide useful information to inform prenatal counseling and delivery planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional prenatal evaluation is reviewed in detail separately.

Fetal surgery is performed at many specialized centers across North America and Europe.</p><p>The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) was a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of fetal surgery for repair of myelomeningocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The trial was conducted from 2003 to 2010 at three institutions in the United States with extensive experience in fetal surgery. Eligible women were randomized to undergo fetal surgery at 18 to 25 weeks gestation (n = 91) or standard postnatal repair (n = 92). The trial was stopped early because of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In an analysis of the complete trial, the need for cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement during the first year of life was lower in the fetal surgery group compared with the postnatal repair group (44 versus 84 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Fetal surgery also resulted in improvement in psychomotor development at 30 months of age as measured by the Bailey Scales of Infant Development II tool (mean score 63.9&plusmn;17.3 versus 58.9&plusmn;15.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Patients who underwent fetal surgery were more likely to achieve independent ambulation at 30 months compared with those who underwent postnatal repair (45 versus 24 percent). Factors associated with independent ambulation included the presence of in utero ankle, knee, and hip movement; absence of a sac over the lesion; and a myelomeningocele lesion of &le;L3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Postnatal motor function was not correlated with either prenatal ventricular size or postnatal shunt placement.</p><p>These benefits occurred despite a higher risk of preterm delivery and pulmonary complications among infants undergoing fetal surgery, and of obstetrical complications including placental abruption, dehiscence of the hysterotomy site, and maternal transfusion at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Mortality was similar in the two groups (one fetal death and one neonatal death in the fetal surgery group; two neonatal deaths in the postnatal surgery group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, in a review of the experience at one center after completion of MOMS, the reported perinatal mortality rate was higher than in the trial; among 100 patients who underwent fetal surgery after 2011, perinatal mortality was 6 percent (two fetal and four neonatal deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In a follow-up study of 115 children who participated in the MOMS trial, fetal surgery was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the need for clean intermittent catheterization by 30 months (38 percent in the fetal surgery group versus 51 percent in the postnatal surgery group; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The participants are being followed into childhood to evaluate the long-term effect of fetal intervention on bladder function and other important outcomes, including bowel function, sexual function, and cognitive development.</p><p>Because fetal surgery is associated with risks of fetal and maternal complications, we agree with recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) that fetal surgery only be offered at facilities with the special expertise, multidisciplinary teams, and facilities to provide the intensive care required for these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In our practice, we inform the family about the option of prenatal surgery, including the uncertainty regarding whether the risks of the procedure are outweighed by the potential benefits, particularly since long-term outcomes are not clearly known. If the family wishes to pursue prenatal surgery, we assist in setting up an evaluation at a specialized fetal surgery center. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Fetal evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LABOR AND DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For infants with a prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele who do not undergo fetal intervention, delivery should occur at a center with a level III neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric neurosurgery services, and other personnel experienced in the neonatal management of these infants. Latex-free gloves and equipment should be used during delivery and subsequent care of the infant because patients with myelomeningocele are at risk for developing life-threatening latex allergy.</p><p>Term delivery is preferable, but increasing ventriculomegaly with macrocephaly on prenatal ultrasound may necessitate preterm delivery as determined by the obstetrical team.</p><p>Fetuses presenting in the breech position are typically delivered by cesarean section. The optimal route of delivery of a fetus presenting in the vertex position is controversial, and no prospective randomized trials have been performed to determine the risks and benefits of labor and vaginal delivery for these infants.</p><p>One retrospective study addressed this question by comparing the outcome of 47 infants with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated myelomeningocele without severe hydrocephalus, delivered by cesarean section before labor, to a historic cohort of 113 infants with myelomeningocele diagnosed after delivery (35 delivered by cesarean section after a period of labor and 78 delivered vaginally) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The level of paralysis at two years of age was approximately two segments lower in the group delivered by elective cesarean section without labor. However, it is possible that advances in neonatal care and prenatal diagnosis led to interventions in the delivery room that resulted in a better outcome in the study group as compared with the historical controls.</p><p>Because no study has definitively shown advantages of cesarean delivery for fetuses with myelomeningocele, we believe vaginal delivery is reasonable if the head is normal size, the meningocele is unlikely to cause dystocia, and there are no obstetrical indications for cesarean. This is an obstetrical decision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF THE NEONATE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after birth, the lesion should be briefly assessed to note its location and size, and whether it is leaking cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Sterile, non-latex gloves should be used to minimize the risk of latex sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Large defects should also be covered by plastic wrap to prevent heat loss. In most cases, only the neurosurgeon should remove the dressing. The infant should be placed in a prone or lateral position to avoid prolonged pressure on the lesion.</p><p>A thorough neurologic examination should be performed.

In a retrospective study of infants with back closure performed after 48 hours of age, ventriculitis occurred less often in infants given antibiotic prophylaxis as compared with those who were not (1 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-treatment-and-outcome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Treatment and outcome&quot;, section on 'Empiric therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The back lesion should be surgically closed within the first 72 hours after birth; this step further decreases the risk of CNS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The recommended technique involves the approximation of the lateral edges of the open neural plate in the midline to form a neural tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This covers the caudal end of the spinal cord with a layer of pia mater. It is unclear whether this decreases the incidence of tethered cord, but it certainly facilitates untethering of the cord later in life, should this be necessary. Complications of closure include CSF leak, infection, and dermoid inclusion tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydrocephalus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following repair of the myelomeningocele, many infants develop some degree of hydrocephalus, which causes the head circumference to increase at a rate greater than the normal curve. We recommend active surveillance of head circumference and ventricular size in the weeks following repair to determine if the infants requires placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.</p><p>Ventricular size should be evaluated soon after birth by ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57510\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57510 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Serial neuroimaging using ultrasound is then performed to identify the development of hydrocephalus. The patient is reassessed every 3 to 10 days depending on the level of concern. Subsequent management varies with the clinical and radiologic findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable or slowly progressive increases in ventricular size in a stable infant should be followed. If the infant is stable and without apnea, feeding normally, and responding normally, we suggest expectant management, measuring the head circumference and imaging of the ventricles with ultrasound every one to three weeks until the head growth has stabilized. In many of these infants, the head growth will slow and eventually follow a curve slightly above but parallel to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile line. This may take several weeks or up to three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, rapidly progressive hydrocephalus that causes the infant to become unstable, or to develop stridor, poor feeding, or emesis should be treated by insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Shunt placement may also be triggered by cosmetic concerns if the infant's head circumference is markedly larger than that of a normal infant this age (eg, nearing the size of a three-year-old child).</p><p/><p>Approximately 60 percent of infants require ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement when followed using the above protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The remaining infants appear to do well without a shunt, and there is no evidence that the lack of a shunt impairs their development. Additional evidence that mild hydrocephalus is not necessarily associated with cognitive dysfunction comes from historical observations: Many of the adults who survived prior to the availability of shunting have large heads and very large ventricles, but have normal intelligence and are living independently. Although shunt placement increases survival through childhood for infants with rapidly progressive hydrocephalus, there is some evidence that having a shunt may reduce survival during adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In a few infants with very early evidence of progressive hydrocephalus, simultaneous myelomeningocele repair and shunt placement may be appropriate. This approach does not appear to increase the complication rate. In a retrospective review, the frequency of CSF infection, shunt malfunction, and symptomatic Chiari II malformation was similar with simultaneous and sequential repair and shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The rate of wound leak was lower and hospital length of stay was shorter in the group that underwent simultaneous repair and shunt placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic and physical function often deteriorate over time. Almost all deterioration has a treatable cause and if not treated appropriately can lead to severe disability by adulthood.</p><p>Deterioration in a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt should prompt evaluation for possible shunt malfunction as the initial consideration. Other causes of progressive disability include tethered cord, progressive compression of the cervical canal from the Chiari II, and hydromyelia, as well as orthopedic and urologic complications. The most common cause of decline is a shunt malfunction; the second most common cause is tethered cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

A baseline head computed tomography (CT) scan, spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and manual muscle tests are essential.</p><p>Regular re-evaluation is necessary to allow early detection of deterioration. Children should be followed by a multidisciplinary team, including pediatric, orthopedic, urologic, and neurosurgical specialists. Patients should be evaluated at least annually for function and clinical status, including manual muscle tests.

Identifying patients who may have a shunt malfunction in this population can be difficult as the classic signs and symptoms may be absent. The signs and symptoms tend to be consistent for a given patient, but vary between individuals.</p><p>Shunt malfunction and infection are discussed in greater detail separately.

In patients with myelomeningocele, tethered cord is typically caused by scar tissue at the site of prior closure. Nearly all children who have undergone myelomeningocele repair have a low-lying spinal cord with adhesions to the surrounding dura; however, only 10 to 30 percent develop symptoms of neurologic deterioration that prompt surgical release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The symptoms of tethered cord are nonspecific, and shunt malfunction must be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Shunt malfunction'</a> above.)</p><p>If a child demonstrates concerning neurologic, urologic, or orthopedic decline, a search for the cause should be undertaken, including imaging of the brain and spine. Neuroimaging is performed chiefly to exclude other potential causes (eg, shunt malfunction). Tethered cord is largely a clinical diagnosis in children with myelomeningocele, since nearly all demonstrate radiographic evidence of tethering.</p><p>Treatment of tethered cord is surgical and consists of releasing the scar tissue around the prior placode closure. Untethering will be easier if the exposed neural tissue was closed into a tube during the primary closure. The symptoms will often stabilize or improve with untethering; however, symptomatic retethering may occur in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>].

Abnormalities of the forebrain are also commonly associated with the Chiari II malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Interestingly, the radiographic appearance of hindbrain herniation is improved in infants who have undergone prenatal closure of their nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Whether this has any long-term impact on outcome is yet to be determined. (See <a href=\"#H178693823\" class=\"local\">'Fetal surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>In some patients, the brainstem or spinal cord becomes progressively compressed within the spinal canal, causing swallowing difficulties, vocal cord paresis, stridor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> apneic episodes. Neck pain is also common. Other symptoms may include new onset of strabismus, facial weakness, progressive weakness in the lower extremities, or worsening incontinence. When present, brainstem compression caused by the Chiari II malformation is associated with a high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Many of these symptoms are nonspecific and in our experience, they are more likely to be due to a shunt malfunction causing increased pressure on the lower brainstem located in the upper spinal canal. Shunt revision usually relieves the symptoms. Shunt malfunction must be definitively excluded before considering an alternative diagnosis and intervention: surgical decompression of the cervical or lumbar CSF spaces in the face of a shunt malfunction may cause herniation of the hindbrain because of the sudden reduction of CSF pressure. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Shunt malfunction'</a> above.)</p><p>When surgical decompression of Chiari II is indicated and shunt malfunction has been definitively excluded, a variety of approaches are used, including cervical bone-only decompression, dural opening (with or without a graft to increase the size of the canal), resection of the cerebellar tonsils, stent placement into the fourth ventricle, or a combination of these.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydromyelia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydromyelia describes the accumulation of fluid within the central canal of the spinal cord. This occurs in individuals with myelomeningocele because of a shunt malfunction or untreated hydrocephalus acting through the persistent embryonic connection between the neurocele, central canal, and the ventricular system of the brain. Fluid outside of the central canal has a different pathophysiology and is known as syringomyelia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Syringomyelia'</a>.)</p><p>It is unclear what role hydromyelia plays in the deterioration of an individual with myelomeningocele. MRI of the spinal cord reveals that 50 percent of the patients who appear to be stable have some degree of hydromyelia; some have severe holocord hydromyelia or segmental hydromyelia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Hydromyelia has some association with shunt malfunction: it is rare in the newborn, and usually develops with the first shunt malfunction. Shunt revision often diminishes or reverses the asymptomatic hydromyelia.</p><p>For patients with hydromyelia and nonspecific symptoms such as progressive scoliosis, urologic problems, pain, and motor or sensory defects, we first exclude shunt malfunction or empirically revise the shunt. If this is not successful, we suggest untethering the cord before considering specific treatment for hydromyelia. In many cases, untethering leads to improvement in the neurologic deficits. It is unclear why untethering of the spinal cord is also effective in reducing the radiologic findings of hydromyelia. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Shunt malfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Tethered cord'</a> above.)</p><p>Interventions for hydromyelia include fenestration and shunting (either to the subarachnoid space or peritoneal cavity), but these approaches can paradoxically increase the defect, cause tethering, or create an imbalance with the ventricular shunt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3754455510\"><span class=\"h3\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures occur in 10 to 25 percent of children with myelomeningocele and correlate with poor cognitive outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The Chiari II malformation is the major factor that distinguishes myelomeningocele from other disorders that are limited to the spinal cord (eg, traumatic paraplegia, spinal cord lipomas) and hence are not associated with cognitive impairment. The Chiari II malformation alters cognitive function by affecting brain development. Cognitive function may be further affected by the common complications of hydrocephalus and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p>Learning disabilities may include poor executive skills, attention deficits, and retrospective and prospective memory problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].

Treatment to reduce bladder pressures and minimize urine stasis usually prevents or attenuates this important complication. Close attention to urinary tract function is also important because changes in bladder function may be the only indication of a change in neurologic function and should prompt an evaluation for shunt malfunction or tethered cord as previously discussed. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Shunt malfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Tethered cord'</a> above.)</p><p>Management of the urinary tract includes early initiation of clean intermittent catheterization and close monitoring for changes in bladder function. Most patients also benefit from anticholinergic medication. These and other interventions can also improve urinary continence, which has important social benefits, allowing children with myelomeningocele to participate in mainstream educational settings. Management of neurogenic bladder and other urinary tract complications associated with myelomeningocele are discussed in detail in a separate topic review.

For the next few weeks, the infant should be monitored closely for the development of hydrocephalus, using serial head circumference measures and head ultrasounds. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surgical closure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hydrocephalus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have rapidly increasing ventricular size, we recommend ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have stable or slowly increasing ventricular size can be followed with serial head circumference measurements and ventricular ultrasounds every one to three weeks, depending on the level of concern, until the head growth has stabilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throughout life, patients with myelomeningocele should have serial evaluations of their neurologic function, including signs and symptoms of spinal cord or brainstem compression. Any changes should prompt evaluation for shunt malfunction. If this possibility is excluded, then tethered cord and brainstem compression from the Chiari II malformation should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly all patients with myelomeningocele have neurogenic bladder. Treatment with early initiation of clean intermittent catheterization reduces the risk of progressive renal disease. Changes in bladder function may be a sign of an acute neurologic complication (eg, shunt malfunction or tethered cord). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract complications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract complications of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In almost all individuals with myelomeningocele, innervation of the bowel and anus are affected, leading to decreased bowel motility and poor sphincter control, and often to fecal incontinence. The goals of a bowel management program are to achieve continence by prompting regular elimination of stool, and to avoid fecal impaction. This is often achievable through the use of oral laxatives, suppositories, and enemas, singly or in combination. Advanced bowel management options include transanal irrigation and the antegrade continence enema procedure. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Bowel management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthopedic management is directed at correcting deformities, maintaining posture, and promoting ambulation to maximize function and independence. Scoliosis occurs in most children with lesions above the second lumbar vertebra. New or rapidly progressive scoliosis in an individual with myelomeningocele may be caused by a reversible neurologic complication such as shunt malfunction, tethered cord, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydromyelia, and should prompt a thorough neurologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-issues-in-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic issues in myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Shunt malfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Tethered cord'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 75 percent of patients with myelomeningocele survive to early adulthood. Long-term outcomes vary considerably depending on the myelomeningocele level, the presence of hydrocephalus, and severity of the Chiari II malformation. (See <a href=\"#H4200177449\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wilson RD, SOGC GENETICS COMMITTEE, SPECIAL CONTRIBUTOR.
