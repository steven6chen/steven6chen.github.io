It is characterized by mutations that lead to a decrease in the level or impairment in the action of von Willebrand factor (VWF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71525 \">table 1</a>). Most cases are transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait that affects males and females equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There are also acquired forms of VWD that are caused by several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathophysiology of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation and diagnosis of VWD will be reviewed here.

It also contributes to fibrin clot formation by acting as a carrier protein for factor VIII, which has a greatly shortened half-life and abnormally low concentration unless it is bound to VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Von Willebrand factor circulates as a series of multimers formed from a basic dimer subunit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>.) High molecular weight VWF multimers are the most active form of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], providing multiple binding sites that can interact with both platelet receptors and subendothelial structures at sites of injury. Plasma VWF is synthesized by megakaryocytes and endothelial cells and undergoes extensive post-synthetic processing. When released acutely from these cells, VWF contains even larger multimers than are normally observed in the circulation. These &quot;unusually large&quot; forms are prothrombotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; they are rapidly proteolyzed by the VWF cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) to the &quot;normal&quot; multimer size distribution as defined by a normal plasma pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although decreased levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) are relatively common, only a fraction of patients come to medical attention because of bleeding symptoms and are diagnosed as having von Willebrand disease (VWD). This low incidence of bleeding is due to the mild nature of the disease in many patients and to the lack of bleeding challenges <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of recognition of minor excessive bleeding (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding) in others.</p><p>Bleeding symptoms in VWD occur when VWF is sufficiently decreased in the plasma or when a qualitative defect in VWF impairs one of its functions. These abnormalities mostly affect platelet plug formation during the primary hemostatic response. As a result, many of the usual clinical manifestations of VWD are similar to those seen in platelet disorders. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Easy bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged bleeding from mucosal surfaces (eg, oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, uterine)</p><p/><p>An exception to this general pattern of bleeding occurs in type 2N VWD in which there is a qualitative defect in VWF that affects its binding site for factor VIII (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Type 2N'</a> below). In these patients, the bleeding is due to low factor VIII levels and mimics the findings seen in classical hemophilia, including soft tissue, joint, and urinary bleeding, and bleeding after invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In the rare patients with type 3 VWD, both types of bleeding (ie, mucocutaneous and soft tissue bleeding as well as joint bleeding) may occur (see <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Type 3'</a> below).</p><p>Patients with VWD can become symptomatic at any age. A typical history in a patient with mild to moderate disease includes epistaxis lasting longer than 10 minutes in childhood, lifelong easy bruising, and bleeding with or following dental extractions, other invasive dental procedures, or other forms of surgery.</p><p>Women with VWD usually have a history of heavy menstrual bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and may have bleeding during the peripartum period, often at or within hours of delivery and at 5 to 10 days after delivery. The bleeding may be delayed until 14 to 21 days postpartum, or persist for this time period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract can be serious, but is less common. Patients may have undergone surgical procedures without excessive bleeding if the surgeon has been meticulous with hemostasis during the procedure.</p><p>In patients with mild VWD, the ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other antiplatelet medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can precipitate bleeding that may not have occurred otherwise. Some patients remain asymptomatic, with the diagnosis being made during the course of screening studies because of a family member with newly-diagnosed severe VWD.</p><p>Bleeding manifestations are more serious and tend to occur earlier in life in patients who have a VWD variant (type 2) or who are homozygous or doubly heterozygous for mutations in VWF (type 3 VWD). Type 3 patients often have symptoms in infancy (eg, with circumcision) or when they begin to be mobile, as bleeding occurs after the usual minor traumas associated with learning to crawl and walk.</p><p>As noted above, soft tissue, joint, and urinary bleeding due to factor VIII deficiency can occur when there is a marked reduction in binding of factor VIII to VWF. This occurs in type 2N VWD which has a defect in factor VIII binding, or in type 3 in which there are factor VIII levels of less than 10 percent along with extremely low or absent plasma VWF. Eruption of deciduous teeth may also cause bleeding, and affected young women may have life-threatening hemorrhage when they reach menarche. Serious and often recurrent and intractable gastrointestinal bleeding also can occur, especially when associated with angiodysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiodysplasia-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-evaluation-and-approach-to-diagnosis#H928693211\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Evaluation and approach to diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Bleeding disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Von Willebrand disease (VWD) should be considered in patients who present with the above clinical manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Personal and family history and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's personal and family history of bleeding episodes is important, and one needs to specifically seek a history of challenges such as invasive dental procedures, tonsillectomy, other surgical procedures (particularly involving mucous membrane surfaces), and menstrual and peripartum bleeding. In general, having several bleeding symptoms makes it more likely that the patient has VWD, and having a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of VWD also makes this diagnosis more likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A medication history is also important because of the frequent use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the population.</p><p>Several questionnaires, called Bleeding Assessment Tools (BATs), have been devised to help unify history taking and help determine the significance of the patient's bleeding history. These tools consist of questions about specific bleeding episodes, their severity, duration, and need for treatment. Some have been validated in practice, and the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) has merged a number of these questionnaires to bring clinical researchers and clinicians together to use a common assessment tool, the <a href=\"https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.isth.org/resource/resmgr/ssc/isth-ssc_bleeding_assessment.pdf&amp;token=gLYjWUwJLyYVZnbDsDux4g4EC5igIkTfJMbTmWhK6g1rPsf+eD32ox30vCS7vAtz3rdCDENPxzNLNhmf8lMV4taqSWmD6+fG0f4fZk5isROgdkKGLT52ftWE41CIC0eb&amp;TOPIC_ID=1307\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ISTH-BAT</a>, which can be found online at the ISTH reference tools page [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. We encourage the use of the ISTH-BAT. The ISTH questionnaire is lengthy and needs to be administered by a trained health care worker, usually the hematologist, but it allows for a quantitative scoring and a more objective bleeding history. In an analysis of data from 1040 adults and 328 children, the normal ranges were determined to be 0 to 3 for adult males, 0 to 5 for adult females, and 0 to 2 for all children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Efforts to design and validate a self-administered test are welcomed; the questionnaire will need to be validated in a larger number of patients and controls without a bleeding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Symptoms limited to bruising need to be interpreted with caution, particularly in women. Hematoma formation with bruising lends more significance to this symptom. A negative bleeding history does not rule out the diagnosis of VWD in patients with a family history of VWD.</p><p>Physical examination should include a search for ecchymoses and hematomas, their size and location, and evidence for current or recent mucosal bleeding. A negative physical examination is not uncommon in patients with VWD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening of family members</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether or not to screen for VWD in an asymptomatic patient with a negative bleeding history but a positive family history is not entirely clear, especially if the patient has not yet been hemostatically challenged (ie, no prior surgery or significant trauma). The following issues are important in making this decision:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of VWD in the family should be a firm one with available data. Specifically, one would want to know how low their VWF values are and how much and what types of bleeding other family members have had.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has not yet been challenged hemostatically, the decision to screen may depend on the patient's personal activities. If <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is quite active physically or plans to be, it may be reasonable to do the testing. If not, one might wait until the patient faces a challenge, although if the patient or family are anxious about this issue and want testing, one might be more likely to test earlier.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient's screening activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is totally normal in the face of no prior bleeding, additional testing is probably not indicated, unless the family history indicates that affected family members have unexpectedly low VWF values in the face of normal aPTTs, a rare occurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients will have testing of platelet count and coagulation studies during the initial evaluation for excessive bleeding or bruising. Patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) generally have a normal platelet count, with the exception of those with type 2B VWD, most of whom will have mild thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count 100,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">140,000/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with VWD have a normal prothrombin time (PT), and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may be normal or prolonged, depending on the degree of reduction of the factor VIII level.</p><p>Three tests are recommended as <strong>initial</strong> <strong>screening tests</strong> for VWD by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (see table for definitions) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73391 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen (VWF:Ag)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma VWF activity (ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF:RCo and VWF collagen binding, VWF:CB)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII activity (FVIII)</p><p/><p>A VWF activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antigen level of 30 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL</span> or less is recommended to establish a firm diagnosis of VWD (see <a href=\"#H623769\" class=\"local\">'Low VWF versus type 1 VWD'</a> below). If there is still a high index of suspicion for VWD in the face of normal or equivocal initial results, further testing is carried out which first includes repeating the initial tests. If the repeat VWF levels are normal, other causes of bleeding should be investigated.</p><p>If one of the VWF tests is abnormal, the following <strong>specialized assays</strong> should be performed (see table for definitions) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73391 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VWF multimer distribution using gel electrophoresis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA)</p><p/><p>These latter two tests should be performed to determine the type of VWD when initial tests are positive, since the type of VWD directs the choice of treatment.</p><p>Ristocetin cofactor activity and VWF antigen tests can be performed on platelet VWF as well as plasma VWF, after VWF has been isolated from circulating platelets. However, methods and reference ranges are not well established for platelet-associated VWF. Decreased platelet VWF has been described as the sole cause of a bleeding diathesis in a few families whose plasma VWF is within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">VWF antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) was initially measured in an electroimmunoassay (Laurell method) using monospecific antibodies to VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At present, this test is usually performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on microtiter plates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Automated methods (utilizing latex beads coated with antibodies to VWF and patient plasma as the source of VWF) have also been introduced; they utilize a turbidimetric end-point. Results of the latex bead assay compare favorably with the ELISA in most, but not all, instances. A potential problem is that rheumatoid factors can falsely elevate the VWF latex assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">VWF activity (platelet binding)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VWF activity is commonly assayed as ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo), which tests the ability of VWF to agglutinate platelets by binding to its primary receptor, platelet glycoprotein Ib (GP Ib) in the presence of ristocetin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ristocetin is an antibiotic that was taken off the market because it caused thrombocytopenia in individuals with normal VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It binds to both VWF and platelet glycoprotein Ib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], and causes agglutination of platelets that can be assessed either visually using a tilt-tube method or with the use of a platelet aggregometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. Formalinized platelets or fragments of platelet membranes can be conveniently used in this test, eliminating the need for fresh washed platelets for each assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. If fresh washed platelets are used, they will be activated by the binding of VWF to GP Ib and will undergo a release reaction and a secondary aggregation reaction.</p><p>Ristocetin cofactor testing has been automated for a number of different analyzers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Many of these tests take advantage of the ability of the patient's plasma VWF to bind to isolated glycoprotein Ib (GP Ib), which usually is attached to a latex bead in these assays. The tests still require ristocetin at an optimal concentration (VWF:GPIbR), but a variation of the test uses a &quot;gain of function&quot; GP Ib mutant (GPIbM, a mutated GPIb that binds VWF more avidly), eliminating the need for ristocetin. A different automated assay measures the binding of a specific monoclonal antibody to the GP Ib site on VWF (VWF:Ab), although this does not necessarily detect the functional platelet binding ability of VWF. Flow cytometry has also been used to measure VWF-platelet binding, but it is not widely available. Most of these tests have been compared with the ristocetin cofactor assay, and they function well in most instances and often are more sensitive below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL;</span> however, a few VWF variants have not been identified correctly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The VWF reagents used should always be related to the WHO standard for VWF, and the results should be reported in international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL</span> or mL, where 100 percent equals 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL</span>. Though the ristocetin cofactor test remains the &quot;gold standard&quot; for VWF's platelet binding activity, the automated tests are generally more reproducible and some are more sensitive in the lower range; they are rapidly becoming widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Collagen binding assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collagen binding has been introduced as a second type of functional assay for VWF (VWF:CB), but is not widely used in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. The binding of plasma VWF to collagen-coated plates is dependent upon the quantity of VWF in plasma and on the presence of higher molecular weight multimers that bind more readily to collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39,40</a>]. This functional assay takes longer to perform, but has gained acceptance in some clinical laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. It measures a different function of VWF from the Ristocetin cofactor activity. Three distinct mutations have been described in families with VWD that cause defective collagen binding and bleeding without other VWF functional defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Other mutations including those that decrease VWF binding to type IV collagen have been described, but not all have been associated with clinical bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623617\"><span class=\"h2\">Factor VIII activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since normal VWF protects factor VIII from proteolysis, decreased plasma VWF or a mutation in the VWF binding site for factor VIII (eg, type 2N VWD) can lead to decreased plasma factor VIII concentrations.

Typically, the VWF:RCo to VWF:Ag ratio (or the VWF:CB to VWF:Ag ratio) is used.</p><p>Most laboratories, however, have not standardized this ratio in a large group of type 1 VWD patients or normal subjects, so the absolute cut-off for this ratio is not known. Type 1 VWD patients usually have a ratio greater than 0.7, with probable lower limits in the range of 0.5 to 0.7.

A decreased ratio of VWF:RCo to VWF:Ag helps distinguish type 2M from type 1. The multimer studies may also show an abnormal banding pattern within each individual multimer; variants that were previously classified as types IC and ID are examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].

A number of patients with decreased collagen binding are also classified as type 2M [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>The Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a rare disorder in which there is a decrease or abnormality in platelet GP Ib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. It can be confused with type 1 or type 2M VWD if an abnormal RIPA is obtained without knowledge of the patient's ristocetin cofactor level. In patients with the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, the RIPA (requiring both normal platelet receptors and normal VWF in the test plasma) will be impaired, but the ristocetin cofactor activity is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 2N</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2N VWD (N is for Normandy where one of the first patients was described) is an uncommon disorder that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

Since the molar concentration in normal plasma of VWF monomers, each of which contains a factor VIII binding site, is much higher than that of factor VIII, the concentration of functional VWF molecules has to fall considerably below 50 percent in order to significantly reduce the factor VIII level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>A serious potential problem is that some patients with type 2N VWD are misdiagnosed as having hemophilia A.
