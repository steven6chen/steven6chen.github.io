Very few people take all of the medicines listed. But if you have this type of heart failure, the list probably includes at least some of the medicines you take.</p><p>Many people take 3 medicines or more. That might seem like a lot. But each of these medicines does something different. The medicines work together to keep you as healthy as possible.</p><p>Keep in mind that the doses and choices of medicines you get might change now and then. Work with your doctor to find the combinations and doses of medicine that work best for you (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59726 \">table 1</a>). If your heart's ability to pump blood changes or if your body gets used to medicines, you might need changes. But if you follow your doctor's suggestions (for example, checking your weight) and report back any problems, those changes can help you feel better and keep you out of the hospital.</p><p>It is a good idea to keep a list of all the medicines you take, and bring it with you each time you visit any doctor. You can find an example of this kind of list at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm079489.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IOhw8tWkhkVaWidZQDUIbu9gDMhwPSip8u9zifYOMQtFzUgxleN7AXwBD6pfdpaGrA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16189\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm</a>.</p><p>The list below includes just some basic information on the main medicines used in heart failure. If you would like more detailed information, including information on the side effects caused by specific medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8479888\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines to treat heart failure</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI</strong> &ndash; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (called &quot;ACE inhibitor&quot;), angiotensin receptor blocker (called &quot;ARB&quot;), and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (called &quot;ARNI&quot;) medicines are often grouped together. That's because they work in similar ways. Doctors usually prescribe an ACE inhibitor before an ARB. But they sometimes switch to an ARB if the patient has side effects with an ACE inhibitor. The ARNI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sacubitril-valsartan</a> is a newer heart failure medicine that can be used instead of an ACE inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI relaxes blood vessels and can lower blood pressure. This makes it easier for the heart to pump. An ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI can also help prevent or undo changes in the shape of the heart that can happen because of heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some examples of ACE inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">enalapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">captopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lisinopril</a> (brand name: Zestril). Some examples of ARBs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">losartan</a> (brand name: Cozaar) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">valsartan</a> (brand name: Diovan). The ARNI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sacubitril-valsartan</a> (brand name: Entresto) has 2 medicines in a single pill. One is the ARB called valsartan. The other is called sacubitril, and can help your body to retain less fluid and relax blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta-blocker</strong> &ndash; A beta blocker slows the heart down and can lower blood pressure. It can help reduce the amount of work the heart has to do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When people first start taking a beta-blocker, they sometimes feel a little worse than before. That is just while the body gets used to the medicine. But once the body gets used to the beta blocker, the medicine can really help. If your doctor prescribes a beta blocker, give it a little time to start working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some examples of beta blockers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">carvedilol</a> (brand name: Coreg), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">metoprolol</a> (brand name: Toprol XL), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bisoprolol</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivabradine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Ivabradine</a> (brand name: Corlanor) is a newer type of drug to slow the heart down. Your doctor might prescribe ivabradine if your heart rate is still a little fast with a beta blocker, or if you cannot take a beta blocker.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diuretic</strong> &ndash; When you have heart failure, your body holds onto extra fluid. A diuretic helps the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. It is sometimes called a &quot;water pill.&quot; It can reduce heart failure symptoms or keep them from getting worse. For example, a diuretic can help pull fluid out of the lungs, which makes breathing easier.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A diuretic makes you urinate a lot, especially when you first start taking it. That actually means the medicine is working. But if the need to urinate a lot makes it hard for you to take the medicine, work with your doctor or nurse to find a good time to take it. Take it at the same time every day and do not miss any doses. It's very important that you take this medicine exactly the way your doctor or nurse tells you to. If you are not able to drink normally or are losing a lot of fluid (for example, if you have diarrhea), ask your doctor if your diuretic dose should change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some examples of diuretics include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">furosemide</a> (brand name: Lasix), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">torsemide</a> (brand name: Demadex), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bumetanide</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist</strong> &ndash; A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is a type of diuretic. It helps the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. But it also helps the body hold onto potassium. That's important because other diuretics sometimes make the body lose too much potassium, which the body needs to work normally. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists might also protect the heart from hormone effects that can happen when a person has heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When taking this type of medicine, it is very important to have regular blood tests to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working. Your doctor or nurse should follow the results of these tests closely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some examples of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">spironolactone</a> (brand name: Aldactone) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">eplerenone</a> (brand name: Inspra).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nitrate with </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydralazine</a> &ndash; A nitrate and hydralazine work together to relax and expand blood vessels. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood throughout the body. This combination of medicines is sometimes used in people who cannot take an ACE inhibitor. Unfortunately, the medicines often cause side effects (such as headaches and nausea), so doctors usually try other options before suggesting them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These 2 medicines come in a single pill, but it is possible to get the 2 ingredients separately for much less money. The 2 ingredients come in pills of &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">isosorbide dinitrate</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydralazine</a>.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Digoxin</a> &ndash; Digoxin helps the heart pump with more force. This can help reduce some of the symptoms of heart failure.</p><p/><p>If you are having trouble getting your medicines or they are too expensive, talk to your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8479914\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
