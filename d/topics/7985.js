As a result, treatment algorithms are drawn from retrospective case series and principles are derived from treatment of sarcomas at other sites, rather than from large clinical trials. Their study is also made more difficult by the diversity of histologic subtypes and the variable clinical behavior. Furthermore, the confining anatomy and proximity to vital structures makes even adherence to traditional margin-driven therapy challenging.</p><p>The demographics of head and neck sarcomas, the clinical behavior of the common subtypes, and general treatment principles will be reviewed here.

The main histologic subtypes are rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in children, osteosarcoma (and chondrosarcoma), angiosarcoma, the common adult soft-tissue sarcomas <span class=\"nowrap\">(undifferentiated/unclassified</span> sarcomas [formerly included within the terms &quot;malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)&quot; and &quot;undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS),&quot; and now a separate soft tissue sarcoma category with an undifferentiated pleomorphic variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]], liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma [LMS], synovial sarcoma), hemangiosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). In series in which desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) are included, these tumors account for a large proportion of cases. Other less commonly occurring sarcomas include hemangiopericytoma, Ewing sarcoma, and alveolar soft parts sarcoma.

General oncologic surgeons are likely to see a different array of patients compared to otolaryngologic surgeons, pediatric surgeons, or plastic surgeons. Many series exclude bone sarcomas or benign or low malignant potential tumors (eg, desmoid tumors and DFSP). Some series include pediatric sarcomas and thus have a very large proportion of RMS; others exclude these subtypes. Many of the largest series use older pathologic classification schemes in which tumors of the fibrosarcoma spectrum were not yet re-categorized appropriately as MFH, pleomorphic sarcoma, or <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span>.

For most patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the superior neuroimaging study. In many cases, computed tomography (CT) scanning complements MRI, and both are helpful in surgical planning, particularly for bone sarcomas. Models can now be made preoperatively from CT scans for expected bone defects, allowing reconstructive planning and preparation to begin preoperatively, thus increasing the efficiency of the intraoperative repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Pretreatment evaluation should also include a directed metastatic workup, with a CT of the chest, a complete blood count, and assessment of serum alkaline phosphatase. A more extensive diagnostic workup (eg, CT of the brain, radionuclide bone scan, positron emission tomography [PET] scan) should generally be based upon symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

There is no consensus on the appropriate use of this imaging modality.

Imaging guidelines from the Children's Oncology Group Bone Tumor Committee recommend radionuclide bone scan <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PET scan for whole body staging for all patients with osteosarcoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55623\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55623 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Regardless of the type of scan that is chosen, the same imaging modality should be used throughout treatment and during posttreatment surveillance. Ideally, a PET scan or bone scan should be performed prior to biopsy to avoid a biopsy-related false positive result.

However, the biopsy method can affect subsequent treatment and thus should be carefully planned in conjunction with the surgeon who will perform the definitive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Despite its absence from this staging system, histopathologic grade likely has a significant influence on prognosis, as it does for soft tissue sarcomas at other body sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>This staging system is used for all soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck, with the exception of angiosarcomas, embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and Kaposi sarcoma (which do not have an AJCC staging system).

The newest version (eighth edition, 2017) classifies bone sarcomas arising in the skull and facial bones the same way as it classifies tumors arising in the appendicular skeleton and trunk, and there is a set of prognostic stage groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110737\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110737 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It remains to be seen whether this version will be widely adopted for clinical use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15528150\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the natural history of head and neck sarcomas parallels that of their non-head and neck counterparts, but with a higher rate of local recurrence after treatment. Whether overall survival rates are lower with head and neck primaries is unclear; the available data are conflicting.</p><p>The worse outcomes with head and neck primary sarcomas can be illustrated by a single institution series comparing outcomes among 102 patients with head and neck sarcoma and 1044 patients with extremity or superficial trunk lesions, all of whom were treated between 1960 and 1999 with surgery and radiation therapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At five years, local control rates were inferior for patients with head and neck primaries (74 versus 85 percent) as was disease-specific survival (64 versus 76 percent). On the other hand, the largest study, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on over 12,000 patients treated between 1973 and 2010, found a five-year cause-specific survival of 66 percent in adults and 73 percent in children with a broad variety of histologic subtypes, and these numbers appear comparable to those of non-head and neck sarcomas.</p><p>It is not clear that a primary site in the head and neck constitutes an independent risk factor for a worse prognosis per se. Rather, the complex functional anatomy of the head and neck makes it much harder to perform a resection with negative margins. The failure to obtain negative margins is associated with a very poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H15527726\" class=\"local\">'Surgical margins'</a> below.)</p><p>As with soft tissue sarcomas in the extremities, lymph node involvement is uncommon, occurring in only about 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The most common histologic head and neck subtypes associated with nodal metastases are rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and angiosarcoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H7798376\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Regional nodes'</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients who die of soft tissue sarcomas in non-head and neck sites die of metastatic disease. In comparison, those with head and neck sarcomas frequently have local relapse and succumb to their tumor without distant metastatic disease. As an example, in a report of 103 patients with sarcoma of the head and neck treated from 1944 to 1988, locally recurrent disease was the sole cause of death in 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The predominance of local recurrence occurs despite a relatively small average size (4 cm) compared with soft tissue sarcomas in other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. A major contributor is the difficulty in achieving clear surgical margins. (See <a href=\"#H15527726\" class=\"local\">'Surgical margins'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgical principles'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15527615\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important prognostic factors are gender, tumor grade and size, status of the surgical margins, histologic subtype, and nodal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/7,8,16,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,16,30,31</a>]. A large study of over 12,000 patients from the SEER database (which did not uniformly include data on grade, size, or margins) identified male gender, more advanced tumor stage, and treatment prior to year 2000 as adverse prognostic factors in multivariate analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Histologic grade and tumor size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most series, prognosis is worse in patients with higher grade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110709\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110709 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and larger size tumors. In one study of 122 sarcomas of the head or neck, patients with high-grade lesions had significantly worse survival compared with those with low-grade lesions (hazard ratio [HR] for death 5.52, 95% CI 1.51-20.21), and locoregional recurrence rates were much higher for lesions &gt;10 cm in diameter compared with tumors &le;5 cm (HR 6.13, 95%CI 1.84-20.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15527726\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive surgical margins are associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/5,7,8,11,20,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8,11,20,31</a>]. In a series of 146 patients with a variety of skull base sarcomas (both of soft tissue and bone), five-year disease-specific survival rates were 77, 43, and 36 percent for those with negative, close (often defined as &lt;1 mm), and positive surgical margins, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/close</span> margins was the only independent predictor of poor survival in multivariate analysis.</p><p>Negative margins are difficult to achieve in the region of the head and neck because these sarcomas tend to grow in tight anatomic confines and in close proximity to vital neurovascular, bony, or other structures.

Overall disease-free survival was 56 percent at five years. Major determinants of survival were adequacy of resection margins and tumor type (tumor grade was not available). Patients with chondrosarcoma or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) had survival approaching 100 percent, while those with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) or fibrosarcoma had survivals of 60 to 70 percent.

Other important considerations include the potential for morbidity related to breathing, swallowing and speaking, and the significant cosmetic deformity that may follow neck and facial resections. The quality of the tissue forming the margin is a more important indicator of the risk for local recurrence than is the physical distance from the tumor to the resection margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thus, the generally accepted recommendation for surgical margins of head and neck sarcomas is to obtain a complete tumor resection with as wide a cuff of normal tissue as is feasible, with as little morbidity as possible.</p><p>The incidence of cervical lymph node metastases is sufficiently low in head and neck sarcomas that elective neck dissections are generally not indicated.

There are no randomized trials proving benefit for RT in head and neck sarcomas, and results from retrospective reports are mixed.

As an example, in a population-based analysis of 11,481 adult and 1244 pediatric head and neck sarcomas reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1973 and 2010, the addition of RT resulted in an 80 percent reduction in survival compared with patients who did not receive adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, this outcome is at least partly the result of negative selection bias (ie, that use of RT is simply a marker for clinically appreciated, higher risk, poorer prognosis disease). To address this issue, the authors of the SEER analysis performed a propensity score-matched analysis and did not confirm an inferior cause-specific mortality in those who received adjuvant RT in conjunction with surgery. A lack of association of adjuvant RT with inferior cause-specific survival was also seen in a separate single institution series from the University of Washington [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, retrospective series suggest a benefit for adding adjuvant RT to surgery in patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck, particularly if they are large and high-grade, or low-grade with positive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> close margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], as is done with extremity sarcomas.

The typical patient presents with a mass or swelling in the cheek or jaw, sometimes with pain and occasionally with dental complaints. Initial treatment should consist of en bloc excision of the tumor with a wide margin of normal tissue, if feasible. For patients with positive surgical margins, reexcision is preferred, if possible. If the margin is still positive after reexcision or if reexcision is not feasible, we suggest postoperative radiotherapy. Although objective data do not exist to assess chemotherapy as a radiosensitizer for margin-positive osteosarcoma of the head and neck, use of concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per week during radio therapy [RT] or 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> during weeks 1 and 4) as a radiation sensitizer is a reasonable alternative. For patients with negative resection margins, we suggest not pursuing adjuvant RT. For most patients with high-grade tumors, we suggest adjuvant chemotherapy using an aggressive cisplatin-based regimen as used for osteosarcomas arising at other sites. For most patients with low-grade tumors we generally suggest not pursuing adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>Osteosarcomas are primary malignant tumors of bone that are characterized by the production of osteoid or immature bone by the malignant cells. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary tumor of bone and about 10 percent of cases arise in the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

In most series, the majority present in the jaw and are about evenly split between the mandible and the maxilla; about 20 percent develop in the extragnathic bones (eg, skull, orbit) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/18,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,47</a>].</p><p>The typical patient presents with a mass or swelling in the cheek or jaw, sometimes with pain, and occasionally with dental complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/44,46,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46,48-50</a>]. There is a slight male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]. The median age at presentation, 36, is at least 10 years older than patients with non-head and neck osteosarcomas, although for non-head and neck osteosarcomas, there is a second peak in incidence in later adulthood that corresponds to secondary Paget disease-related osteosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/46,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49,50</a>].

While patients with extremity osteosarcoma are at very high risk for metastatic involvement of the lungs, lung metastases are less common in patients with jaw osteosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/18,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,53,54</a>].

As an example, patients with mandibular and maxillary tumors have better survival than do those with disease in the paranasal sinuses or calvarial bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Older series of patients with head and neck osteosarcoma reported five-year survival rates of approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/46,48,50,51,58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48,50,51,58-62</a>]. However, improved outcomes have been seen over time, attributed in part to the introduction of modern multimodality management, which usually includes systemic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/15,53,54,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,53,54,63</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One contemporary series of 44 patients, 30 of whom received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, reported three-year overall, disease-specific, and recurrence-free survival rates of 81, 81, and 73 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Local control was achieved in 78 percent, a marked improvement over historical series, in which 50 to 65 percent of patients recurred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis included 541 patients identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1973 to 2011 using site-specific codes and histologic classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Importantly, the SEER database does not allow assessment of use of chemotherapy or status of margins. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 years were 53 percent and 62 percent, respectively, and at 10 years 35 percent and 54 percent, respectively. The magnitude of the difference between disease-free and overall survival in this very young population points to possibly significant late treatment-related mortality.</p><p/><p>Local recurrence predominates; distant metastases are less common. As an example, in a meta-analysis that included 163 patients with head and neck osteosarcoma from non-randomized studies, 56 percent recurred; of these, 50 percent recurred locally, 3 percent regionally, and only 20 percent had a component of distant failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Other series report somewhat higher rates of distant metastasis (35 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]).</p><p>Local recurrences are usually, although not uniformly, fatal. These patients can occasionally be salvaged surgically if wide surgical margins can be attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rarity of head and neck osteosarcoma and the lack of prospective trials make it difficult to reach valid conclusions regarding optimal treatment.</p><p>En bloc excision with a margin of normal tissue is the goal of surgical treatment; however, soft tissue margins may be difficult to obtain because of the proximity of critical structures. The soft tissue resection margin can be evaluated intraoperatively by frozen section analysis until either a negative margin is obtained or further resection is not feasible. However, the bony margins cannot be microscopically evaluated in this way, and only a gross estimate of the resection margins can be performed intraoperatively. If the permanent sections show a positive bone margin, this should be addressed surgically, if possible, with reresection of the margin soon after the initial procedure.</p><p>As with other head and neck sarcomas, reconstruction is often best accomplished with microvascular free flap reconstruction. Mandibular and associated soft tissue defects can be reconstructed with a free flap of fibular bone and overlying skin. This minimizes speech, swallowing, and cosmetic defects as well as donor site morbidity. Dental implants may be possible after healing is complete. Reconstruction of midface and skull base tumors may require either locoregional rotational flaps for smaller defects or microvascular free flaps (such as the rectus abdominis) for larger defects. Maxillofacial prosthetics may also be necessary.

For most patients with low-grade tumors, we suggest not pursuing adjuvant chemotherapy. The decision to pursue chemotherapy for very small high-grade tumors and for very large low-grade tumors must be individualized and made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Modern treatment regimens for osteosarcomas at non-head and neck sites generally include systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy to eradicate occult micrometastatic disease. While chemotherapy (given postoperatively [adjuvant] or preoperatively [neoadjuvant]) improves the prognosis of extremity osteosarcoma dramatically, its benefit in osteosarcoma of the head and neck is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-osteosarcoma#H82108693\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the management of osteosarcoma&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Prospective data to support benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in head and neck osteosarcomas are lacking. In uncontrolled case series, the use of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with improved survival in patients with head and neck osteosarcomas in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/18,55,64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,55,64-67</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/55,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,63</a>] series. Two meta-analyses on this subject reported conflicting conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/46,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,68</a>]. Part of the explanation for these disparate results may have been related to incomplete information on the influence of surgical margin status. Nevertheless, in many series, the majority of patients with osteosarcomas of the head and neck have received modern combination chemotherapy, and the improved outcomes over time have been largely attributed to the use of combined modality therapy (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Natural history and prognosis'</a> above). Whether it is optimal to deliver in the preoperative or postoperative setting is unclear.</p><p>Whether patients with low-grade osteosarcomas benefit from chemotherapy is unclear. Most low-grade jaw osteosarcomas may be adequately treated with surgery alone, as long as clear margins can be achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Larger low-grade osteosarcomas, with poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], may also benefit from chemotherapy, but the decision to pursue chemotherapy in these situations must be individualized and made on a case-by-case basis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3299381\"><span class=\"h4\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of achieving clear surgical margins has been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Following initial en bloc excision of the tumor with a sufficiently wide margin of normal tissue, we do not generally give adjuvant RT if the surgical margins are clear. If the margin is positive, reexcision should be performed if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The optimal chemotherapy regimen to use for radiosensitization is not established. We generally use concomitant cisplatin (35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per week during radiotherapy [RT] or 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> during weeks 1 and 4). If both adjuvant chemotherapy and RT are being used, we would generally delay RT until the end of adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>Conventional osteosarcoma is relatively resistant to RT, although the small cell variant may be more radiosensitive. Primary RT is usually inadequate to achieve local control, particularly for bulky tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]; surgery is preferred if possible.</p><p>For patients treated with effective surgery and chemotherapy, adjuvant RT does not improve survival and increases the risk for secondary tumors.

Laryngeal chondrosarcomas may be amenable to complete excision with preserved laryngeal function through a voice-sparing partial laryngectomy. For the rare patient with a high grade (mesenchymal) chondrosarcoma of the head and neck, the poor prognosis seen with surgery alone provides a strong argument to discuss the potential benefits of neoadjuvant or adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in medically fit patients.</p><p>Chondrosarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant bone tumors that share in common the production of chondroid (cartilaginous) matrix. Chondrosarcomas of the head and neck are rarer than osteosarcomas.

Men are affected three times more often than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Chondrosarcomas are classified according to microscopic appearance. In the report of the National Cancer Data Base of 400 cases, histologic subtypes included conventional (81 percent), myxoid (11 percent), and mesenchymal (9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The mesenchymal and myxoid subtypes were rare among Caucasian patients (17 percent) and more common among African Americans and Hispanics (32 and 45 percent, respectively). Histologic classification and grading of chondrosarcomas is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chondrosarcoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chondrosarcoma&quot;, section on 'Classification, histology, and clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment usually consists of wide local excision. The specific anatomic location of chondrosarcomas greatly affects resectability. For example, only recently have skull base chondrosarcomas been removed en bloc using advanced neurosurgical approaches. Such radical procedures may require sacrifice of multiple cranial nerves and necessitate carotid artery occlusion, with its attendant risk of death, stroke, and other significant morbidities. Management of skull base chondrosarcomas is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chordoma-and-chondrosarcoma-of-the-skull-base\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, chondrosarcomas of the larynx may be excised completely while preserving laryngeal function through a voice-sparing partial laryngectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Local recurrences following organ preserving surgery usually require salvage laryngectomy and postoperative RT.</p><p>The majority of head and neck chondrosarcomas (with the exception of the mesenchymal subtype) are low grade and stage I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], and long-term survival or cure is achieved with aggressive surgery in most patients. In contrast, high-grade tumors such as mesenchymal chondrosarcoma have a poorer prognosis. In the National Cancer Data Base series, in which 60 percent of patients were treated with surgery alone, and 21 percent received surgery plus RT, the overall disease-free survival at 5 and 10 years was 87 and 71 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The myxoid and mesenchymal subtypes had a worse five-year disease-free survival (45 and 53 percent, respectively), as did those with higher grade tumors (67 percent).</p><p>Other reports note a low (approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]) survival for high-grade tumors, largely as a result of distant metastases. In at least one of these series, suboptimal resection may have contributed to the poor outcome; complete resection was only accomplished in one of seven patients with high-grade histology compared with 9 of 10 with low-grade histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>Experience with adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy in patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma suggests the potential for benefit. In a study of 113 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, the addition of chemotherapy provided a 57 percent improvement in survival and 52 percent improvement in local control among those with localized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. There are no published reports of effective adjuvant chemotherapy specific for head and neck chondrosarcomas. Nevertheless, the poor prognosis seen with surgery alone provides a strong argument to discuss the risks and potential benefits of adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy with patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma who have not received neoadjuvant therapy as long as they are medically fit and able to tolerate the therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chondrosarcoma#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chondrosarcoma&quot;, section on 'Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p>Unresectable chondrosarcomas (ie, those arising in the cervical spine or base of skull) can be treated with RT, especially proton beam RT.

The clinical presentation is dependent upon tumor location and may include a facial or neck mass, proptosis, nasal discharge, headache, vomiting, change in hearing, vision, speech, swallowing, or respiratory symptoms. The treatment of RMS is complex and typically involves surgery, RT, and multi-agent chemotherapy. If appropriate, children should be offered treatment on a clinical trial. Complete excision should be considered for localized disease as long as functional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmetic results are acceptable. When surgical excision is not possible, or when surgery is incomplete, RT is used for local control.</p><p>Risk-adapted therapy guidelines assist in treatment decisions for adjuvant RT and adjuvant chemotherapy, including selection of the appropriate chemotherapy regimen.

The sites of head and neck RMS can be divided into three main groups: orbit (25 percent), parameningeal area (paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, middle <span class=\"nowrap\">ear/</span> mastoid, and infratemporal fossa; 50 percent), and non-orbital non-parameningeal sites (scalp, parotid gland, oral cavity, pharynx, thyroid and parathyroid glands, and neck; 25 percent).</p><p>The two major histologic subtypes of RMS are embryonal and alveolar. When head and neck RMS arises in the orbit, it is almost always of the embryonal type. A unique form of embryonal RMS, the botryoid variant (sarcoma botryoides), typically arises within the wall of the bladder or vagina, almost exclusively in infants. However, it can arise within the nasopharynx in older children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Histologic classification'</a>.)</p><p>Cases of RMS are reported in adults at all sites, including the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. In a report from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Database (SEER), 35 percent of head and neck RMS reported between 1973 and 2005 arose in patients 19 years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation is dependent upon tumor location and may include a facial or neck mass, proptosis, nasal discharge, headache, vomiting, change in hearing, vision, speech, swallowing, or respiratory symptoms.

MRI is increasingly considered the imaging method of choice for certain primary locations, such as the head and neck, because of its multiplanar capacity, ability to attenuate bone artifact, and superior soft tissue contrast. While CT scan may best identify lung metastases, whole body MRI or integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scans efficiently evaluate bone, soft tissue, and parenchymal organs. Distant brain metastases are uncommon. In general, brain imaging is reserved for patients with clinical suspicion; however, imaging of the brain is often included as part of the imaging of the primary site, especially in parameningeal tumors. Since parameningeal tumors may show earlier spread to the skull base and the intracranial compartment, lumbar puncture should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging&quot;, section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>.)</p><p>Two different staging systems are used in conjunction by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group <span class=\"nowrap\">(IRSG)/Children's</span> Oncology Group (COG) for the purpose of estimating prognosis and assigning risk-directed treatment. The IRSG Clinical Group (CG) system recognizes four disease categories (Group I through IV) that are based upon the degree of tumor spread at diagnosis and the amount of disease remaining after initial surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Although the CG system is clinically useful for assigning treatment, it does not take into account other important prognostic factors, such as tumor size and primary site, disease extent, histology, and patient age. A site-based tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system was incorporated for assessing prognosis and assigning therapy in conjunction with the traditional surgicopathologic clinical grouping system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62717 \">table 6</a>). Although there are clear prognostic differences based upon the site of origin, within the head and neck, prognosis is more specifically dependent upon location than TNM stage and upon other factors such as age and histologic type.</p><p>Both the CG and TNM stage as well as several other clinicopathologic variables are included in a prognostic stratification system that is used to select treatment based upon the estimated prognosis (risk-adapted therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404 \">table 7</a>)). RMS of the orbit and eyelid are considered favorable prognosis sites, while parameningeal tumors are considered unfavorable.

In a review of the SEER database of 11,481 adult cases and 1244 pediatric cases of head and neck sarcoma diagnosed between 1973 and 2010, five-year disease-specific survival with RMS was 68 percent in the pediatric group compared with 36 percent in the adult cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The poorer outcomes in adults may reflect, in part, the inadequacy of primary treatment. However, adults are also more likely to present with advanced disease. As an example, in one series of 26 adults with head and neck RMS, 69 percent were stage III or IV at presentation, and the five-year survival rate for all patients was 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In contrast, in the IRSG studies, fewer than 15 percent of children had stage IV disease, and the cure rate with multimodality therapy was about 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/91,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,97,98</a>].

Confirmation with lymph node sampling is recommended only when clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imaging studies suggest lymph node involvement. There is some concern that lymph node involvement might be underestimated with current guidelines, which suggest radiographic screening for evidence of suspicious lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. In particular, some data suggest that patients with parameningeal primary sites and alveolar histology may be at a higher than expected risk for nodal dissemination, and that thorough staging of the retropharyngeal and cervical lymph nodes is necessary in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].

Although locally aggressive, with a propensity for local recurrence, even after complete resection, they do not have the capacity to establish metastatic lesions.

The tumor often presents as a firm, solitary, slowly enlarging, cutaneous nodule between 2 and 5 cm in size. The scalp and neck (supraclavicular fossa) are the most common sites in the head and neck. As with other sites, DFSP of the head and neck has a marked propensity for local recurrence but is typically associated with long term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/5,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,10</a>].

There may be a role for chemotherapy or hormonal therapy in patients with unresectable or recurrent desmoid tumors. Although close observation is an acceptable strategy for stable asymptomatic desmoids, treatment is indicated for symptomatic patients, if there is imminent risk to adjacent structures or if the tumor creates cosmetic concerns; if observation is chosen, follow-up should be frequent to avoid substantial disease progression that can be associated with high morbidity.

Wide local excision (WLE) with 3 cm margins of visibly uninvolved tissue, when possible, and inclusion of superficial fascia produces better clearance rates, but with a corresponding loss of normal tissue. As at other sites, Mohs micrographic surgery of DFSPs arising in the head and neck has been shown to provide adequate local control while reducing local recurrence rates compared with WLE (1.11 versus 6.32 percent in one systematic review) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>], with a significant sparing of adjacent normal tissue, thus preserving cosmetically and functionally vital tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/125-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">125-129</a>].

Although adjuvant radiation is often recommended for patients with positive resection margins, there is no consensus regarding the role of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with completely resected disease since its benefit is limited to improved local control but not improved overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].

The majority of DFSPs have a translocation involving chromosomes 17 and 22, which places platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGFB) under the control of the COL1A1 promoter, leading to constitutive activation of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase. Orally active small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib inhibit the PDGFR. Imatinib is approved in the United States and Europe for use in adult patients who have unresectable, recurrent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastatic DFSP, either alone or in combination with surgery.

Extirpative surgery with wide margins is preferred, if feasible. We recommend adjuvant RT (either preoperative or postoperative) for all high-grade tumors and any malignant tumor (even low-grade) treated with less than wide margin excisional surgery. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy following optimal local therapy remains uncertain. We do not routinely pursue this approach for soft tissue sarcomas arising in the head and neck; however, it may be considered for patients with a good performance status who are at high risk of a distant or possibly local recurrence.</p><p>Approximately 40 percent of all head and neck sarcomas do not fit into any of the above categories. These include a variety of histologies <span class=\"nowrap\">(undifferentiated/unclassified</span> sarcoma [previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)], fibrosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors [MPNST], synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma [LMS], liposarcoma, etc) and they can arise from any site in the head and neck.

Synovial sarcomas involving sites in the head and neck are rare overall; they appear to behave more aggressively than those involving the extremities, and prognosis is generally less favorable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/132-135\" class=\"abstract_t\">132-135</a>].</p><p>One study examined prognostic factors and implications for treatment in 103 patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the head or neck who were treated from 1944 to 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-sarcomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Neck primaries occurred in 23 percent, with a variety of other sites accounting for the remainder. MFH was the most common histologic subtype.

The five-year local control rate was only 47 percent, and local tumor was the cause of death in 63 percent. In multivariate analysis, the only independent prognostic factor for survival was the ability to perform excisional surgery. Local control was better for patients with tumors of the head than of the neck, and better for patients receiving RT plus surgery versus RT or surgery alone.

Because of their proximity to vital structures and the relatively small space of the head and neck region, surgical removal of head and neck sarcomas often cannot achieve the ideal &quot;wide&quot; resection margins that are preferred in other anatomic sites, and there are important considerations for morbidity related to breathing, swallowing and speaking, and the significant cosmetic deformity that may follow neck and facial resections.
