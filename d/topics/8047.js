It probably represents a severe form of preeclampsia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975 \">table 2</a>), but the relationship between the two disorders remains controversial. As many as 15 to 20 percent of patients with HELLP syndrome do not have antecedent hypertension or proteinuria, leading some authorities to believe that HELLP is a separate disorder from preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Both preeclampsia with severe features and HELLP syndrome may be associated with serious hepatic manifestations, including infarction, hemorrhage, and rupture. </p><p>This topic will focus upon the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of HELLP syndrome. Preeclampsia is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HELLP develops in approximately 0.1 to 0.2 percent of pregnancies overall and in 10 to 20 percent of women with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464511939\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A previous history of preeclampsia or HELLP is a risk factor for HELLP syndrome (see <a href=\"#H632892225\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies'</a> below). A variety of genetic variants associated with an increased risk of HELLP syndrome have been reported, but have no role in clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In contrast to preeclampsia, nulliparity is <strong>not</strong> a risk factor for HELLP syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Half or more of affected patients are multiparous. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464512040\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of HELLP syndrome is unclear. If it is a form of severe preeclampsia, it likely originates from aberrant placental development and function (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>). As an independent entity, it has been attributed to abnormal placentation, similar to preeclampsia, but with greater hepatic inflammation and greater activation of the coagulation system than in preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. In a case report of a woman with severe early HELLP syndrome, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>, a targeted inhibitor of complement protein C5, was associated with marked clinical improvement and complete normalization of lab parameters for 16 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The authors chose this intervention based on the hypothesis that <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/HELLP</span> is a systemic inflammatory disorder and the complement cascade is a key mediator, and the observation that women with mutations in complement regulatory proteins appear to be at increased risk of severe preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>In less than 2 percent of patients with HELLP, the underlying etiology appears to be related to fetal long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In one case series, all six pregnancies with fetal LCHAD deficiency developed severe maternal liver disease (HELLP or acute fatty liver of pregnancy [AFLP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These complications probably were not due to chance or maternal heterozygosity for LCHAD deficiency alone because three other pregnancies with unaffected fetuses among these mothers were uncomplicated. In another case series in which 19 fetuses had LCHAD deficiency, 15 mothers (79 percent) developed AFLP or the HELLP syndrome during their pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although these findings inform theories about the pathogenesis of HELLP, the laboratory tests have no role in clinical management of women with HELLP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632891544\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HELLP syndrome has a variable presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64665\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64665 \">table 3</a>). The most common symptom is abdominal pain and tenderness in the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant, or below the sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Many patients also have nausea, vomiting, and malaise, which may be mistaken for a nonspecific viral illness or viral hepatitis, particularly if the serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are markedly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Less common signs and symptoms include headache, visual changes, jaundice, and ascites.</p><p>Hypertension (defined as blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;140/90</span> mmHg) and proteinuria are present in approximately 85 percent of cases, but it is important to remember that either or both may be absent in women with otherwise severe HELLP syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Signs and symptoms typically develop between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation, but second trimester or postpartum onset is also common. In an illustrative series of 437 women who had 442 pregnancies complicated by the HELLP syndrome, 70 percent occurred prior to delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of these patients, approximately 80 percent were diagnosed prior to 37 weeks of gestation and fewer than 3 percent developed the disease between 17 and 20 weeks of gestation. The disease presented postpartum in 30 percent, usually within 48 hours of delivery, but occasionally as long as 7 days after birth. Eighty percent of postpartum patients with HELLP had evidence of preeclampsia before delivery; in the remaining 20 percent, signs and symptoms of preeclampsia were first detected after delivery.</p><p>Serious maternal morbidity may be present at initial presentation or develop shortly thereafter. This includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), abruptio placentae, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, subcapsular or intraparenchymal liver hematoma, and retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Some investigators obtain alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels instead of, or in addition to, AST levels. An advantage of the AST is that it is a single test that reflects both hepatocellular necrosis and red cell hemolysis.</p><p/><p>These thresholds were chosen, in part, to avoid problems related to differences in assays used to measure liver enzymes, which may result in an elevated value in one hospital that is near normal in another. We do not include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the laboratory criteria for HELLP syndrome because it is a nonspecific finding associated with both hemolysis and liver disease. These criteria have been adopted by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy.</p><p>As discussed above, women who do not meet all of the above laboratory abnormalities are considered to have partial HELLP syndrome. However, these patients may progress to complete expression of HELLP syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HELLP syndrome may occasionally be confused with other diseases complicating pregnancy: acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), gastroenteritis, hepatitis, appendicitis, gallbladder disease, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), lupus flare, antiphospholipid syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), pancreatitis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53332 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These disorders can often be readily distinguished by the clinical history and laboratory findings. (Refer to individual topic reviews on these subjects).</p><p>In one series of 46 women who developed liver disease during pregnancy severe enough to require admission to a liver failure unit, 70 percent had acute fatty liver and 15 percent had HELLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Most of the remaining patients had liver disease that was unrelated to pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute fatty liver of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of AFLP commonly includes nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, <span class=\"nowrap\">polydipsia/polyuria,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">jaundice/dark</span> urine, encephalopathy, and <span class=\"nowrap\">hypertension/preeclampsia</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. HELLP may be difficult to distinguish clinically from AFLP since both occur at the same time in gestation and share several clinical features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57913\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57913 \">figure 1</a>). In fact, in one study approximately half of AFLP patients based on the Swansea criteria (which identify the most severe spectrum of the disease) also fulfilled criteria for HELLP syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to differentiate between the two disorders because women with AFLP can rapidly develop liver failure and encephalopathy. Additional laboratory testing can be helpful: prolongation of the prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), severe hypoglycemia, and elevated creatinine concentration are more common in women with AFLP than in those with HELLP. Hypertension is more common in HELLP than in AFLP (in one review: 80 to 100 percent of cases versus 26 to 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]). &#160;</p><p>Of note, women with AFLP are more likely than women with HELLP to have offspring with an inherited defect in mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids, such as long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, or carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/11,12,14,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14,22,23</a>]. However, this information is not typically available during differential diagnosis, and is not highly sensitive or specific. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>AFLP can be confirmed by diagnostic liver biopsy, but this is rarely performed because the clinical diagnosis is usually reasonably certain, the information gained would not change management (ie, delivery of the fetus), and the procedure exposes the mother and pregnancy to additional risks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69691\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69691 \">picture 2</a>). Furthermore, AFLP and HELLP share several common histological features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Liver biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombotic microangiopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure occurring late in pregnancy can also occur in HUS and TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. TTP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HUS should be considered in all pregnant women with severe thrombocytopenia, severe anemia, and elevated LDH levels with minimal elevation of AST (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53332 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The distinction between TTP, HUS, and severe preeclampsia or HELLP is important for therapeutic and prognostic reasons. However, the clinical and histologic features are so similar that establishing the correct diagnosis is often difficult; furthermore, these disorders may occur concurrently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Time of onset may suggest one disorder over the other. The onset of TTP tends to be earlier in gestation than the onset of preeclampsia or HELLP: about 12 percent of TTP in pregnancy occurs in the first trimester, 56 percent in the second trimester, and 33 percent in the third <span class=\"nowrap\">trimester/postpartum,</span> whereas preeclampsia-HELLP does not occur before 20 weeks of gestation and most cases are diagnosed in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A history of proteinuria and hypertension prior to onset of hemolysis, liver abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia favor the diagnosis of preeclampsia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2127265344\"><span class=\"h4\">Laboratory findings in differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies are most helpful for distinguishing between TTP, HUS, and HELLP as the coagulation abnormalities in these disorders are different. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HELLP is associated with thrombocytopenia and, in severe cases, there may be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with the attendant prolongation of the PT and aPTT, and reductions in the plasma concentrations of factors V and VIII.

There are few studies on the outcome of expectant management of HELLP syndrome. In these studies, the laboratory abnormalities of HELLP syndrome reversed in a subset of patients managed expectantly and serious maternal complications were uncommon with careful maternal monitoring and timely intervention. However, the aim of expectant management is to improve neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is no evidence demonstrating improvement in overall perinatal outcome with expectant management compared with pregnancies delivered after a course of corticosteroids, and no maternal benefits from expectant management.

Labor can be induced in women with favorable cervices or pregnancies at least 30 to 32 weeks of gestation. Cesarean delivery is performed for the usual obstetrical indications (eg, breech, nonreassuring fetal status). However, we feel cesarean delivery is probably preferable in pregnancies less than 30 to 32 weeks of gestation if the cervix is unfavorable for induction, especially if there are signs of fetal compromise (growth restriction, abruptio placenta, oligohydramnios). Induction of these pregnancies, even with use of cervical ripening agents, generally has a high failure rate and is often prolonged, thereby potentially exposing the mother and fetus to a higher risk of complications from severe HELLP syndrome.

In this population, the potential risks of preterm birth are outweighed by the risks associated with HELLP syndrome. We also deliver pregnancies &lt;23 weeks of gestation because expectant management is associated with a high risk of maternal complications without significant improvement in perinatal prognosis.

Although the laboratory abnormalities of HELLP syndrome will reverse in a subgroup of patients managed expectantly and serious maternal complications are uncommon with careful maternal monitoring, overall perinatal outcome is not improved with expectant management.

Dexamethasone does not accelerate resolution of laboratory abnormalities or reduce the risk of maternal complications.
