Fibroids may develop anywhere within the muscular wall of the uterus, including submucosal, intramural, or subserosal positions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53241 \">figure 1</a>). For women with a pedunculated submucosal fibroid that is contained within the uterine cavity, removal is typically performed using hysteroscopy. Infrequently, uterine contractions will push a pedunculated submucosal fibroid through the cervical canal and it may prolapse into the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pedunculated fibroids that dilate the cervix or prolapse through the cervix into the vagina can usually be removed via the vagina.</p><p>Removal of subserosal or intramural fibroids through a vaginal colpotomy incision is an uncommonly performed procedure that has also been referred to as vaginal myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This approach has been associated with an increased risk of infection compared with other surgical approaches to myomectomy. This procedure is not discussed here. &#160;</p><p>Vaginal myomectomy for a prolapsed submucosal uterine fibroid is reviewed here. Hysteroscopic, abdominal, and laparoscopic approaches to myomectomy are discussed separately.

In general, uterine leiomyomas are the most common type of pelvic tumor in women, with a prevalence of up to 80 percent. Submucosal fibroids account for approximately 15 to 20 percent of these and an unknown proportion of submucosal leiomyomas prolapse through the cervix. In our experience, this clinical finding is uncommon, but is not exceedingly rare. The epidemiology and risk factors of uterine leiomyomas are discussed separately.

Often, uterine cramping is significant during the process of fibroid expulsion through the cervix. Rarely, profuse bleeding occurs.</p><p>General symptoms of submucosal fibroids include heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H735961\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidental finding on pelvic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prolapsed fibroid may be discovered during a pelvic examination performed for other indications. A prolapsed uterine leiomyoma is visualized on speculum examination as a mass protruding from the cervix. (See <a href=\"#H1456367\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic examination'</a> below.)</p><p>In our experience, these women may not have initially complained of associated symptoms, but further questioning often reveals a history of heavy vaginal bleeding, pelvic cramping, or vaginal discharge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1456332\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic examination is required to further evaluate symptoms suggestive of a prolapsed fibroid and helps to differentiate a leiomyoma from other lesions. Imaging studies are required only if examination of the mass is not consistent with any of these lesions. Pathology evaluation is required to make the final diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1456367\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On speculum examination, a prolapsed uterine fibroid appears as a bulbous mass protruding from the external cervical os. In general, the size ranges from approximately 1 to 6 cm in diameter. Larger fibroids are unlikely to prolapse through the cervix. The fibroid may be friable and active bleeding may be present.</p><p>The mass should be palpated to identify the consistency and whether there is a pedicle. A fibroid is likely to have a firmer consistency than a cervical or endometrial polyp, which is usually soft and fleshy. A prolapsed fibroid or endometrial polyp will have a palpable pedicle that originates from the uterine cavity, while a cervical polyp will originate from the exocervix or endocervical canal. It is not always possible to differentiate between fibroids and polyps on examination and the final diagnosis is made with pathology evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H735886\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H690549\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A lesion that originates from the uterine cavity but is extensive and has no clear pedicle raises suspicion for a uterine sarcoma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H485249\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging is not typically required prior to removing a lesion that is consistent with a prolapsed fibroid on examination, and should be performed only if the appearance of the mass is not consistent with a leiomyoma or cervical or endometrial polyp or if the pedicle of the mass cannot be seen or palpated on examination. In such cases, imaging helps guide surgical planning and further evaluates the possibility of a uterine sarcoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2709798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine sarcoma: Classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>If imaging is required, pelvic sonography is typically the first line study, since it provides good quality images of uterine lesions and is relatively inexpensive. In our experience, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often helpful, since it is more likely to provide information about the size and position of the uterine attachment than ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50202\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50202 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Limited sequences (T2, sagittal, axial and parallel to the uterus) without contrast are usually sufficient to evaluate the mass and can reduce the cost of imaging. As an example, a case report described a large prolapsed fibroid connected to the endometrial cavity by a stalk. On the sagittal T2 MR image, the stalk contained multiple fine linear structures, which the authors described as the &ldquo;broccoli sign&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Preoperative biopsy is indicated only if the appearance of the lesion is not consistent with a fibroid or a cervical or endometrial polyp, although uterine sarcomas may be heterogeneous and the pathologic diagnosis based upon a small biopsy may not be possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2709798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine sarcoma: Classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690549\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of a prolapsed fibroid is made upon visualization and palpation during pelvic examination.

Cervical polyps are a very common finding and prolapse of an endometrial polyp occurs infrequently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cervical anomalies and benign cervical lesions&quot;, section on 'Polyps'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-polyps#H10071598\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial polyps&quot;, section on 'Polypectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Differentiating between these lesions on physical examination is discussed above.

Polypoid uterine adenomyosis may mimic a prolapsed fibroid or endometrial polyp on examination, but will be identified with pathology evaluation after removal.

Most clinicians remove these lesions even in asymptomatic patients, because symptoms eventually develop in nearly all women. Removal of prolapsed fibroids is also prudent to prevent uterine infection.</p><p>The removal of a prolapsed uterine fibroid is performed either in an office setting or with a minimally invasive approach in an operating room. In general, there are few contraindications to vaginal myomectomy with the exception of women with significant medical co-morbidities who have an increased risk of complications associated with anesthesia or who have a bleeding diathesis or are on anticoagulants. These women require medical consultation prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5351763\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL MYOMECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal myomectomy is often performed in an office setting during the visit at which the prolapsed fibroid was discovered.

The potential need for a further procedure if the fibroid cannot be removed completely should be discussed, including laparoscopic or abdominal myomectomy or possibly hysterectomy. This discussion should be documented in the medical record and on the procedure consent form signed by the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H736508\"><span class=\"h3\">Operative setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most prolapsed myomas can be removed in an office setting, but some vaginal myomectomy procedures should be performed in the operating room for better access to anesthesia, measures to control bleeding, and surgical instruments. It is important to assess the feasibility of an office-based procedure before the procedure is attempted to avoid incomplete removal, excessive blood loss, or the need to transfer the patient to the operating room. </p><p>There are no data regarding removal in an operating room rather than in an office setting. In our practice, we remove fibroids with the following characteristics in the operating room:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larger than 4 cm </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pedicle cannot be visualized or palpated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broad-based (pedicle &gt;2 cm in diameter) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical fibroid that is not pedunculated </p><p/><p>Removal in the operating room may also be required for women who cannot tolerate an office procedure or who have a bleeding diathesis or are on anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"#H485115\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690752\"><span class=\"h3\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal myomectomy of a prolapsed fibroid in an office setting is typically performed with a paracervical block. There are no data regarding the optimal type of anesthesia for this procedure. Some women can tolerate the removal of small fibroids with a thin pedicle without anesthesia. Use of an anxiolytic or conscious sedation may be used to facilitate an office procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pudendal-and-paracervical-block#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pudendal and paracervical block&quot;, section on 'Women undergoing gynecologic procedures'</a>.)</p><p>For procedures in an operating room, the decision to use sedation, regional, or general anesthesia should be made through consultation with the patient and anesthesiologist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690598\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are not required for vaginal myomectomy of a prolapsed myoma for the prevention of surgical site infection or endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In our practice, however, we give a single dose of perioperative antibiotics if the fibroid is necrotic or obviously infected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H17330349\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>There is a potential risk of infection, as with any surgical procedure, but there are few data about this procedure and no cases of infection were reported in the two largest series, each with 46 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H485884\"><span class=\"h3\">Thromboprophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Procedures performed in an office setting are typically brief and thromboprophylaxis is not required. For women who undergo vaginal myomectomy in an operating room, since surgery is performed in the lithotomy position and may be prolonged, thromboprophylaxis with an intermittent pneumatic compression device should be used in all but the shortest procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H17332175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Thromboprophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure for vaginal myomectomy is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prolapsed fibroid is grasped with a towel clamp or tenaculum and pulled down into the vagina and away from the cervix. Excessive traction on the fibroid should be avoided to prevent avulsion of the lesion or uterine inversion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the entire pedicle of the fibroid can be palpated, the entire pedicle can often be clamped across the base. It is then cut and suture ligated using a delayed absorbable suture material. Alternatively, a suture can be passed around the pedicle and tied or a pre-tied surgical loop passed over the fibroid to the pedicle and the base ligated. We secure this with an additional suture ligature. After it is cut, the stalk will usually recede into the uterine cavity.</p><p/><p>If the entire pedicle cannot be palpated because it is broad-based or the fibroid is within the cervical canal and the cervix is dilated, access to the fibroid can be obtained by making cervical incisions at 2, 6 and 10:00 (D&uuml;hrssen's incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]). This procedure should only be performed in an operating room with adequate anesthesia.</p><p>After making the cervical incisions, using gentle traction, the fibroid can be brought down into the vagina and morcellated using a scalpel or Mayo scissors until the base of the pedicle can be palpated. Once the pedicle can be palpated, clamping or suture ligation can be accomplished and the remainder of the fibroid excised. Care should be taken to avoid extension of the incisions into the lateral vaginal fornices to avoid the uterine vessels. The cervical incisions should then be closed. In our practice, we use a 0-polyglactin (Vicryl&trade;) in a running stitch. </p><p>If the vaginal myomectomy procedure is performed in the operating room, some surgeons perform hysteroscopy after removal of the fibroid to evaluate the uterine cavity for a remnant of the fibroid and for additional submucous fibroids that may be amenable to hysteroscopic myomectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-myomectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic myomectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179596\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of vaginal myomectomy for a prolapsed fibroid are rare, based upon the few available data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/3,5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,11</a>]. In two retrospective series of 46 patients, there were no complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. </p><p>The most likely potential complication of vaginal myomectomy is excessive bleeding from the fibroid site. This can be managed with pressure, using either a uterine pack or a bladder catheter balloon placed inside the uterus and inflated or, if the site is accessible, with a suture. These may be left in place for several hours and then slowly removed to ensure hemostasis. If bleeding persists, hysteroscopy should be performed to identify and control the bleeding site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-an-episode-of-severe-or-prolonged-uterine-bleeding#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Managing an episode of severe or prolonged uterine bleeding&quot;, section on 'Intrauterine tamponade'</a>.)</p><p>Uterine inversion due to excessive traction on the fibroid prior to removal is another potential complication. Replacement of an inverted uterus is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=puerperal-uterine-inversion#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Puerperal uterine inversion&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p>There is a theoretical risk of infection, but none was reported in the two largest series, each with 46 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure appears successful in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. A retrospective series of 46 women who underwent vaginal myomectomy for a prolapsed fibroid reported two failed procedures in which the lesion could not be removed, both of which were due to difficulty reaching the fibroid pedicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Another series reported treatment with vaginal myomectomy, abdominal myomectomy, or hysterectomy, but the rate of conversion from a vaginal myomectomy to another procedure was not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Recurrence of a prolapsed fibroid or of fibroid-related symptoms appears to occur infrequently. A retrospective series of 46 women reported that, at 5.5-year follow-up, 9 percent required a repeat vaginal myomectomy and 6 percent had a hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hysterectomy in these cases may have been due to indications other than the original prolapsed myoma.</p><p>To avoid recurrent fibroid-related symptoms, hysteroscopy may be performed after removal of a prolapsed fibroid to exclude other pedunculated or submucosal fibroids that may require treatment. Alternatively, a preoperative imaging study can be used to evaluate the uterus for other fibroids.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful to determine the size and position of the attachment of the fibroid to the uterus. During pregnancy, prolapsed fibroids should be removed only for excessive bleeding, infection, pain or urinary retention. If obstruction of labor occurs or is predicted, cesarean section can be performed and the fibroid can be removed at a later time. Surgical removal during pregnancy may be associated with rupture of the membranes, preterm labor or hemorrhage and need for hysterectomy. In two women reported requiring removal, there were no complications.</p><p>Management of uterine leiomyomas in pregnant women is discussed in detail separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

For women with submucosal fibroids that have not prolapsed, removal is typically performed hysteroscopically. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a fibroid that has prolapsed through the cervix may present with vaginal bleeding, watery vaginal discharge, uterine contractions, pressure from a vaginal mass, or they may be asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H179244\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of a prolapsed leiomyoma is made upon visualization during a pelvic speculum examination. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (without contrast) is helpful to provide information about the size and position of the uterine attachment. The diagnosis is confirmed with pathology examination. Preoperative biopsy is not typically required. (See <a href=\"#H690549\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolapsed leiomyomas require removal and can often be removed in an office setting. We suggest removal in an operating room rather than in an office setting for women with fibroids with the following characteristics: non-prolapsed, larger than 4 cm, broad-based, the pedicle cannot be visualized or palpated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Removal in the operating room is also preferable for women who cannot tolerate an office procedure or who have a bleeding diathesis. (See <a href=\"#H736508\" class=\"local\">'Operative setting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal myomectomy of a prolapsed myoma is usually successful. Conversion to abdominal myomectomy or abdominal hysterectomy has been reported. Complications of the procedure are rare. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H179596\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During pregnancy, prolapsed fibroids should be removed only for excessive bleeding, infection, pain or urinary retention. If obstruction of labor occurs or is predicted, cesarean section can be performed and the fibroid can be removed at a later time. Surgical removal during pregnancy may be associated with rupture of the membranes, preterm labor or hemorrhage and need for hysterectomy.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Baird DD, Dunson DB, Hill MC, et al.
