ID encompasses a broad spectrum of functioning, disability, and strengths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ID is an important public health issue because of its prevalence and the need for extensive support services. Its management requires early diagnosis and intervention, coupled with access to health care and appropriate supports. Identifying a cause enables focused interventions, treatments, surveillance, and appropriate counseling, with anticipation of possible medical or behavioral complications and a more specific prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology of ID and the evaluation of affected children for a specific cause.

The term replaces and improves upon the older term of &quot;mental retardation.&quot; A variety of other terms are used outside of the United States to describe ID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57206 \">table 2</a>). The severity of ID is defined according to the level of support needed to address impaired adaptive functioning. Standardized intelligence quotient testing is no longer used to classify severity of impairment in ID.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Global developmental delay</strong> &ndash; Global developmental delay (GDD) is the preferred term to describe intellectual and adaptive impairment in children &lt;5 years old who fail to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning. Not all children with GDD will meet criteria for ID as they grow older. The term ID usually is applied to children &ge;5 years old, when the clinical severity of impairment is more reliably assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167153175\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167153413\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of ID varies substantially among studies due to differences in study design, diagnostic approach, severity of the condition, and population characteristics, such as age. In the general population, the prevalence of ID (with deficits in both adaptive and intellectual functioning) is approximately 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. ID is mild in approximately 85 percent of affected individuals.</p><p>The prevalence of global developmental delay (GDD; ie, intellectual and adaptive impairment in children &lt;5 years old) is estimated to be 1 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. GDD does not necessarily predict later ID, although there is a strong correlation.</p><p>The prevalence of ID varies with age and gender, and is highest in school-age and male populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is estimated that approximately 30 percent more males are diagnosed with ID as compared with females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the gender difference diminishes with more severe ID. The prevalence of mild ID is more variable across populations than is severe ID, varying with environmental factors of maternal education, educational access, or opportunities and access to healthcare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167153419\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important risk factors for ID include maternal age (older age is associated with greater risk) and maternal education (lower levels are associated with greater risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Many other risk factors for ID have been identified and they differ somewhat according to the severity of ID.</p><p>In a large birth cohort in Tennessee, low level of maternal education was the strongest predictor of mild ID, and a stronger predictor than maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The risk of ID in children of mothers with &le;12 years of education was seven times greater compared with mothers with some post-secondary education, and three times greater than those with a high school diploma. The risk for mild ID was slightly increased in children born to mothers 15 to 19 years old, while the risk of moderate to severe ID was greatest in those born to mothers 40 to 44 years of age.</p><p>In a study of children born in California between 1987 and 1994, the risk of unexplained ID was increased among males, low birth weight infants, multiple births, second or later-born children, older maternal age at delivery, and lower maternal level of education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The risk for ID also appears to be associated with advanced paternal age; one study found that paternal age &gt;40 years is associated with an increased risk for mild to moderate ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167148873\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of ID are extensive and include any disorder that interferes with brain development and functioning.

Metabolic disorders may be the cause ID or may be a comorbid condition. ID can occur in isolation or with neurological abnormalities such as epilepsy or structural brain defects, or with other congenital anomalies.</p><p>A minority of cases have environmental causes such as teratogens, toxins, infections, trauma, birth asphyxia, and nutritional deficiencies. The timing, dose, and extent of environmental exposure are important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The increasing use of next-generation DNA sequencing techniques (eg, whole exome sequencing [WES]) has uncovered many more genes involved in both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Newborn screening advances in many countries have been pivotal in the early diagnosis and treatment of these children. Increasing identification of treatable inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) has enabled specific intervention, functional improvement, or stabilization.

The higher yield of CMA compared with G-banded karyotype analysis or FISH is primarily because of its sensitivity for submicroscopic copy-number variations (ie, deletions and duplications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 33 studies of patients with ID, autism spectrum disorder, or multiple congenital anomalies, the average diagnostic yield of CMA was 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another study of more than 35,000 patients with ID, CMA detected a pathogenic abnormality in nearly 19 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>CMA does not detect point mutations (sequence variants) responsible for single-gene disorders. In addition, CMA will not identify balanced translocations, such as translocations or inversions and may not detect low-level mosaicism, but these are relatively infrequent causes of abnormal phenotypes in this population.</p><p>Clinicians should be aware that there are different platforms for CMA studies. Oligonucleotide-based arrays provide a superb means of detecting DNA copy-number changes, including single exon deletions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. There are a large number of designs of CMA with different levels of resolution (from approximately 1 Mb to several kb). The arrays might be whole-genome arrays, designed to cover the entire genome, or targeted arrays, which target known disease-causing regions.</p><p>Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays can detect copy-number changes, as well as long contiguous stretches of copy-number neutral regions of absence of heterozygosity that can be associated with uniparental disomy or parental consanguinity. Both of these findings increase the risk for autosomal recessive conditions. In addition, SNP arrays detect triploidy, low-level mosaicism, and chimerism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Combined <span class=\"nowrap\">oligonucleotide/SNP</span> arrays are also available to pool the advantages of each method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Deciphering variants of uncertain clinical significance may be challenging. Interpretation of a CMA result requires expert review to determine whether a copy-number variant is clinically significant. In some cases, testing of the patient's parents is necessary to fully assess the clinical significance of a result to enable appropriate genetic counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/22,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,72</a>]. Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are frequently observed for several disorders associated with genomic microdeletions or microduplications. Carrier parents may be completely healthy for some of these disorders, such as 15q13.3 deletion, 1q21.1 deletion, and <em>NRXN1</em> deletion.</p><p>If the CMA testing result is normal or yields a known benign variant, then further evaluation using specific tests may be considered, as recommended in a consensus statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In another report, 10 of 120 children had abnormal EEGs associated with epileptic syndromes, although it is likely that they already had a recognized seizure disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause/abstract/9,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,84</a>].

In a child with suspected genetic disorder and a nondiagnostic WES study, re-evaluation is recommended every few years, in view of the expanding scientific advances concerning novel genetic disorders of ID.

In the general population, the prevalence of ID is approximately 1 percent. ID is mild in approximately 85 percent of affected individuals. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H167153175\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A genetic cause can be identified in &gt;50 percent of cases of ID in populations referred for specialty evaluation. Down syndrome is the single most common genetic cause of ID. X-linked disorders (including fragile X syndrome) account for approximately 10 to 12 percent of ID in males. De novo dominant mutations are an important cause of severe ID. (See <a href=\"#H167148879\" class=\"local\">'Genetic causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nongenetic prenatal causes of ID include congenital infections, and teratogens such as alcohol, lead, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a>. Perinatal abnormalities account for up to 5 percent of ID and include preterm birth, hypoxia, infection, trauma, and intracranial hemorrhage. Postnatal and acquired causes of ID include accidental or nonaccidental trauma, central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, congenital hypothyroidism, hypoxia (eg, near-drowning), environmental toxins, psychosocial deprivation, malnutrition, intracranial infection, and CNS malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H167152857\" class=\"local\">'Environmental causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection and sequence of diagnostic tests in children with ID is guided by individual patient characteristics and the availability of specific tests. The evaluation begins with a detailed medical history (including review of newborn screening results), family history, and thorough physical examination (including neurologic examination and evaluation for dysmorphic features). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with features suggestive of a specific diagnosis, the initial evaluation involves testing for the specific syndrome or disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107958\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107958 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H988137389\" class=\"local\">'Testing for specific disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with unexplained ID (ie, those without features suggestive of a specific diagnosis and those with negative results of specific tests), we suggest the following testing for genetic and metabolic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95374\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95374 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is the first-line genetic test for unexplained ID and detects a cause in 15 to 20 percent of the cases of ID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72211\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72211 \">table 3</a>). Abnormalities that can be detected by CMA include submicroscopic deletions and duplications. If CMA is not available, then G-banded karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization testing may be applied instead. (See <a href=\"#H18781219\" class=\"local\">'Chromosomal microarray analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with features that suggest the possibility of a balanced translocation in the family (eg, maternal history of frequent miscarriages or a family history of chromosomal abnormalities), G-banded karyotyping should be performed either before or in addition to CMA. (See <a href=\"#H1977480125\" class=\"local\">'Karyotype analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the CMA is normal or benign, fragile X testing should be performed (if not already obtained based on clinical suspicion). (See <a href=\"#H31558952\" class=\"local\">'Testing for fragile X syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood lead testing should be performed if the child has not had prior lead screening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> risk factors for exposure are present (eg, persistent mouthing behavior, living in a house or child care facility built before 1950, recent immigration or home renovation, folk remedies, and some parental occupations [smelting, soldering, and auto body repair]). (See <a href=\"#H2810354544\" class=\"local\">'Lead screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuroimaging should be performed if there are concerning features in the history (eg, seizures, progressive or degenerative neurologic symptoms) or abnormal findings on physical examination (eg, microcephaly, macrocephaly, focal neurologic deficits). Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the above testing is negative, genetics consultation should be obtained to guide further evaluation, which may include metabolic testing (if not done previously) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> whole exome sequencing (depending on availability). (See <a href=\"#H941038336\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H488491940\" class=\"local\">'Whole exome sequencing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a pediatric geneticist is valuable for many children with ID, especially those with moderate to severe ID who remain undiagnosed despite appropriate investigation. The consultation may yield a definitive diagnosis and facilitate genetic counseling for the family and appropriate management of the patient.
