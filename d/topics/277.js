It is an autosomal dominant disorder with low penetrance; development of symptoms is affected by a variety of exacerbating factors.</p><p>Despite its well characterized molecular genetics, the diagnosis of AIP is challenging. Symptoms are often vague and nonspecific; the other possible causes of neurologic findings and abdominal pain are numerous; and acute porphyria is often not considered because it is rare. Clues from the family history may be absent, because penetrance of AIP is low and symptoms may not manifest in the majority of family members with a disease-causing mutation. Even if acute porphyria is considered, many clinicians are unfamiliar with typical findings of the disease, appropriate testing, and interpretation of test results. As a consequence, diagnosis and life-saving treatment are often delayed.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of AIP will be reviewed here. Management of AIP and a general overview of the porphyrias are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10090359\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Porphyrias are caused by alterations in the enzymes of heme biosynthesis. Heme is essential in the function of hemoglobin and many other hemoproteins, including hepatic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 enzymes. The liver is the major source of overproduction of heme pathway intermediates in patients with hepatic porphyrias such as AIP; and the central, peripheral, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems are affected when levels of these intermediates are elevated in the circulation, suggesting neurotoxic effects of one or more intermediates. Some neurological manifestations may result from heme depletion in neuronal cells, although this remains unproven. (See <a href=\"#H10089546\" class=\"local\">'Neurological dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H940543\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIP is caused by heterozygosity for a mutation in the gene encoding porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) and previously referred to as uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with low penetrance. More than 300 <em>PBGD</em> gene mutations have been recognized in AIP, all of which lead to severe loss of PBGD enzymatic activity from the mutant allele. Virtually all remaining PBGD activity is due to expression from the unaffected allele.</p><p>There is no convincing evidence for genotype-phenotype correlation in AIP (ie, particular mutations do not predict disease severity). Rather, disease severity is highly variable, even within families that share the same mutation. Disease severity is affected by a variety of environmental and other factors that act primarily by increasing expression of an enzyme upstream of <span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</span> in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1). (See <a href=\"#H10089479\" class=\"local\">'Enzymatic defect'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10089552\" class=\"local\">'Exacerbating factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The <em>PBGD</em> gene is transcribed as two separate splice variants, one erythroid-specific (expressed only in erythroid precursor cells), the other a housekeeping form expressed in all cell types, including hepatocytes and to a minor extent erythroid cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96535\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96535 \">figure 1</a>). The two isoforms are produced through alternative splicing of two distinct primary mRNA transcripts arising from two different promoters for the same gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The housekeeping promoter (upstream of exon 1) is active in all tissues, while the erythroid-specific promotor (upstream of exon 2) is only active in erythroid cells. Sequences in the erythroid promoter are recognized by erythroid-specific trans-acting factors, such as GATA-1 and NF-E2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>In AIP, the <em>PBGD</em> mutation always affects hepatic PBGD (ie, the housekeeping form of the enzyme). The erythroid enzyme is generally affected as well because the mutations generally occur in a region of the gene used for transcribing both housekeeping and erythroid forms, although alterations in the erythroid enzyme are not important in causing the disease. Mutations in some families (eg, splice-site mutations in exon 1, base transitions in intron 1) result in decreased PBGD expression in non-erythroid tissues including the liver, but not in erythroid cells, because transcription of the gene in erythroid cells starts downstream of the site of the mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The observation that some individuals who inherit such mutations have clinical symptoms of AIP supports a role for deficiency of the housekeeping form in disease pathogenesis. This observation also accounts for the finding that in some AIP families, erythrocyte PBGD activity may be within the normal range in all those who have inherited the familial mutation. (See <a href=\"#H177669\" class=\"local\">'Confirmatory testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10089479\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzymatic defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIP mutations in <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> decrease the activity of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</span> enzyme in the liver. This cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the third step in heme biosynthesis, whereby four molecules of porphobilinogen (PBG; a five-membered pyrrole ring) are sequentially condensed to form hydroxymethylbilane (HMB; a linear tetrapyrrole) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 3</a>). HMB is unstable and is rapidly metabolized by the fourth enzyme in the pathway to uroporphyrinogen III.</p><p>The PBGD enzyme is found in two forms: an erythroid-specific form that is synthesized only in red blood cell (RBC) precursors in the bone marrow, and a housekeeping (ubiquitous) form found in the liver and other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,6</a>]. As circulating RBCs age, residual amounts of the erythroid-specific enzyme decline, which may cause variability in measurements of erythrocyte PBGD activity. Decreased activity of the hepatic (housekeeping) form of PBGD, rather than the erythroid form, is responsible for AIP disease manifestations. The role of the liver in the mechanism of neuronal damage is supported by findings from liver transplantation: patients with AIP who survive after a liver transplant from an unaffected donor have marked clinical improvement; liver transplant recipients without porphyria who receive a liver from a donor with AIP have neurovisceral symptoms and elevated PBG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Despite the causative role of <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutation in AIP, symptomatic AIP does not develop in the majority of individuals with the mutation, who have asymptomatic (latent) AIP throughout life (ie, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutation is necessary but not sufficient for symptomatic disease). AIP also becomes latent in some patients with a history of symptomatic disease once they determine the exacerbating factors responsible for their attacks and are able to eliminate these factors. </p><p>In addition to reduced PBGD activity, symptomatic AIP requires a marked induction of the housekeeping (ubiquitous) form of the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase (ALAS1), which is upstream of PBGD in heme synthesis pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 2</a>). ALAS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for heme synthesis in the liver. Marked ALAS1 induction leads to increased production and accumulation of ALA and PBG. This, coupled with their decreased metabolism due to PBGD deficiency, cause accumulation of these potentially toxic intermediates. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and imaging findings'</a> below.)</p><p>ALAS1 synthesis is normally regulated by a pool of &quot;free&quot; heme in hepatocytes that is not yet committed to hemoprotein synthesis. An increase in this &quot;free&quot; heme pool represses the synthesis of ALAS1. Most of the heme synthesized in liver is used to make hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are abundant and turn over rapidly. Thus, the pool of &quot;free&quot; or regulatory heme in hepatocytes is depleted by substances that induce CYP synthesis. CYP inducers and reduced food intake can also induce ALAS1 directly.</p><p>ALAS1 synthesis is induced by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depletion of the regulatory hepatic &quot;free&quot; heme pool, which in AIP is further favored by a partial deficiency of PBGD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some drugs, xenobiotics, and sex hormones (especially progesterone) that may induce synthesis of ALAS1 and CYPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10089558\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10089564\" class=\"local\">'Sex hormones'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caloric and carbohydrate restriction. (See <a href=\"#H10089570\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition, glucose metabolism, and stress'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic stress, which may induce hepatic heme oxygenase and accelerate heme destruction and depletion of the regulatory heme pool, although this mechanism is not proven in AIP. (See <a href=\"#H10089570\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition, glucose metabolism, and stress'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Many of these factors contribute in an additive fashion to cause ALAS1 induction and increased levels of ALA and PBG, leading to exacerbations of AIP.</p><p>The PBGD enzyme has a unique cofactor, a dipyrromethane, that binds to its catalytic site, upon which four additional pyrroles are assembled, forming a linear hexapyrrole; after formation of the hexapyrrole, HMB is released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. It is possible, although unproven, that high concentrations of PBG that accumulate during exacerbations of AIP may inhibit the interaction of this cofactor with the enzyme and further reduce hepatic PBGD activity.</p><p>ALA and PBG are colorless. However, PBG degrades to form porphobilin, a brownish product excreted in urine. In addition to ALA and PBG, urinary porphyrins are also increased in AIP. Their formation may be enzymatic or non-enzymatic. At high concentrations in urine, PBG molecules can randomly associate non-enzymatically to form a mixture of uroporphyrin isomers. However, there is evidence that porphyrins in AIP are predominantly isomer III, which are formed enzymatically, perhaps from ALA transported to tissues other than the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Porphobilin and increased porphyrins account for the reddish-brown urine seen during acute attacks. (See <a href=\"#H2059233\" class=\"local\">'Bladder dysfunction/red urine'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10089546\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurological dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic dysfunction is responsible for the symptoms of AIP. Symptoms may be due to a combination of central, peripheral, sensory, motor, autonomic, and enteric nervous system abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-delayed-gastric-emptying#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of delayed gastric emptying&quot;, section on 'Enteric nervous system'</a>.)</p><p>The exact mechanism of these nervous system abnormalities is unknown. As with all acute porphyrias, the most favored explanation is that one or more heme pathway intermediates that are overproduced by the liver, or products derived from them, are neurotoxic. Favorable experience with liver transplantation, which corrects PBGD deficiency in the liver but not in other tissues, supports an essential role for the liver in the neuropathic process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. An alternative hypothesis is that deficiency of heme in neuronal cells causes symptoms by limiting formation of heme-containing proteins important for neurologic functioning; however, there is less evidence supporting a role for heme depletion in the pathogenesis of the nervous system abnormalities.</p><p>Evidence supporting the role of ALA or an ALA derivative as the pathogenic intermediate in AIP includes the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating levels of ALA are increased in a variety of conditions with similar neurologic sequelae, including all four of the acute porphyrias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51032 \">table 1</a>), lead poisoning, and hereditary tyrosinemia type I.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ALA can enter cells readily and be converted to porphyrins, which in turn may have toxic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ALA is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and can interact with GABA receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p/><p>However, a study of ALA loading in a normal volunteer to levels seen in patients with AIP during acute attacks did not show any adverse neurologic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Suggestions that reduced formation of heme-containing proteins might have clinical consequences in AIP come from the following observations, although there is little evidence of this mechanism in humans:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heme is essential for mitochondrial electron transport used to make ATP, and lack of heme might cause dysfunction of the axonal membrane Na<sup>+</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/K<sup>+</sup></span> ATPase, adversely affecting neuronal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased production of nitric oxide by the heme-containing enzyme nitric oxide synthase might compromise cerebral and intestinal blood flow in AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic heme depletion in rats impairs the activity of the hepatic enzyme tryptophan pyrrolase, which is associated with increased tryptophan levels in plasma and brain, and increased synthesis of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetically engineered <em>PBGD</em> mutant mice (created by gene targeting) show impaired motor function and ataxia, despite normal or only slightly increased ALA levels in plasma and urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H10090359\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>In many cases, it is apparent that exacerbating factors are additive. For example, in a study that evaluated acute attacks in 47 individuals with acute porphyria receiving anesthetic agents (33 of whom had AIP), porphyric symptoms were worsened by anesthesia in 9 of 14 patients who already had symptoms; in contrast, none of the 37 patients who received an anesthetic during an asymptomatic period developed symptoms due to the anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Some patients continue to have attacks of AIP after known exacerbating factors are addressed, indicating that additional factors contribute to the clinical expression of the disease (eg, disease-modifying genes, other inducers of ALAS1); these factors remain to be identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10089558\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications are among the most important exacerbating factors for AIP.

It typically presents in the third or fourth decades of life. Acute attacks are exceedingly rare before puberty, and few well-documented instances of AIP in children are described in the literature. Rare homozygous cases are manifest in children, but with a different clinical picture that includes impaired neurological development but not acute attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>The lack of major AIP symptoms before puberty was illustrated in a Swedish registry that evaluated 61 healthy children aged 3 to 16 years, who were diagnosed with AIP based on DNA testing rather than symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Clinical findings were evaluated prospectively for approximately 2.5 years, during which time symptoms developed in only six children (10 percent). In these six cases, symptoms were generally mild and of short duration (eg, abdominal pain or nausea for two or three days). None of the children had paresis or other severe symptoms. Moreover, urinary levels of ALA and PBG were elevated only slightly or not at all during these episodes. Since abdominal pain is reported in 10 to 20 percent of healthy children, these findings may not be different from the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of AIP is highly variable and the symptoms are nonspecific, which accounts in part for delays in diagnosis. Most individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</span> mutations <strong>never</strong> develop symptoms (ie, most individuals with a mutation have latent rather than manifest AIP). Of note, the neurovisceral symptoms in AIP are indistinguishable from the symptoms of other acute porphyrias.

These symptoms are due to abnormalities of the peripheral, autonomic, enteric, and central nervous systems. Symptoms typically resolve between attacks, although patients can develop chronic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chronic manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>AIP does not have cutaneous manifestations, with the rare exception of patients with advanced renal failure, who may develop elevations in plasma porphyrins that produce blistering skin lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51032 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10092231\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manifest (symptomatic) AIP is characterized by acute attacks of neurovisceral symptoms accompanied by laboratory findings such as elevations in urinary porphyrin precursors and porphyrins. Attacks develop over hours to days and persist for days to weeks, depending upon precipitating factors and treatment. An exacerbating factor is often apparent, but may not be in patients with frequent recurrent attacks. The frequency of attacks is highly individual for each patient. As noted above, these acute neurovisceral symptoms are identical to other acute porphyrias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is the most common and often the earliest symptom in AIP, occurring in 85 to 95 percent of patients with acute attacks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It is usually severe, steady, and poorly localized. Sometimes there is associated cramping. Also common are constipation, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and signs of ileus such as abdominal distension and decreased bowel sounds. Diarrhea and increased bowel sounds are sometimes seen.</p><p>Because the pain and other symptoms are neuropathic rather than infectious or inflammatory, abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis are usually minimal or absent during an acute attack. If present, these findings suggest an inflammatory disease rather than a direct manifestation of AIP. However, the presence of an inflammatory process does not exclude the possibility of an AIP attack; infection may be a precipitating factor for an acute attack, and treatment for infection and AIP may be needed simultaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-management#H7384748\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Management&quot;, section on 'Elimination of exacerbating factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory and motor neuropathy is common during acute AIP attacks and may precede the abdominal pain. The presentation is variable and the onset may be acute. Pain in the extremities, along with patchy numbness, paresthesias, and dysesthesias, may occur. A peripheral motor neuropathy develops early in some attacks, but is more often a later manifestation of a prolonged attack.</p><p>Motor weakness, when present, usually begins proximally in the upper extremities and may progress to the lower extremities and distally. Especially with prolonged attacks, it may also involve cranial nerves and lead to bulbar paralysis, respiratory impairment, and death. Advanced motor neuropathy with quadriplegia and respiratory paralysis can occur and is potentially reversible with appropriate treatment (eg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>); however, some permanent paralysis may remain in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Autonomic, enteric, and central nervous system involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autonomic nervous system is commonly affected in AIP.

Hypertension, sweating, restlessness, and tremor also occur. Attacks are accompanied by marked elevations of catecholamines, which may explain some of these symptoms. Involvement of the enteric nervous system is also likely, but has not been studied directly.</p><p>Insomnia is often an early symptom of an AIP attack. Other acute neuropsychiatric manifestations include anxiety, restlessness, agitation, hallucinations, hysteria, disorientation, delirium, apathy, depression, phobias, and altered consciousness, ranging from somnolence to coma.</p><p>Central nervous system (CNS) involvement can cause seizures, and involvement of the hypothalamus can result in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which may also cause seizures from hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Porphyria should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with unexplained abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuropsychiatric symptoms even when acute porphyria is not the most likely diagnosis (ie, even when the index of suspicion is not yet high). While every patient with an acute episode of abdominal pain should not be screened for acute porphyria, testing is appropriate after an initial workup for more common causes is unrevealing. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In addition to the importance of considering AIP, early testing for elevated PBG using spot urine is also important because PBG testing is not available in-house at most medical centers, and there will likely be delay in obtaining a result from an outside laboratory. Urinary PBG testing is very sensitive and specific for AIP, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria when done in the setting of acute symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115704392\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of the evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIP (or other acute porphyria) should be suspected in an adult with otherwise unexplained neurovisceral symptoms, including abdominal pain; vomiting; constipation; muscle weakness; psychiatric symptoms; or pain in the limbs, head, neck, or chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856 \">table 3</a>). Previous similar and recurrent symptoms may have occurred. Importantly, a negative family history is not helpful in excluding the diagnosis of AIP, because symptomatic disease may skip generations; in some families, only a single individual who carries the AIP disease mutation has manifestations of AIP. Ethnicity is also not helpful because AIP occurs in all races. &#160;</p><p>The diagnostic approach depends on whether the patient is symptomatic at the time of testing. Symptomatic patients are tested for elevations of urinary porphobilinogen (PBG); if this test is positive, the patient can be diagnosed with acute porphyria, and treatment can (and often should) be initiated without waiting for additional testing to determine the specific type of porphyria. However, samples for this subsequent testing should be obtained at the time of the acute attack (ie, before therapy is initiated) because samples obtained before treatment have the greatest likelihood of providing a clear diagnosis.</p><p>Major features of the diagnostic evaluation include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Establish presence of acute porphyria and start therapy</strong> &ndash; A patient with acute symptoms who is not previously known to have acute porphyria should have urinary PBG tested with as little delay as possible. Urinary porphyrins are also measured on the initial spot urine sample, but results of this testing are not immediately available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A substantial elevation of urinary porphobilinogen PBG (eg, &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> or &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine) is sufficient to establish the presence of acute porphyria; importantly, <strong>this is the only result required to initiate treatment</strong>, which is the same for all of the three most common acute porphyrias (AIP, hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], and variegate porphyria [VP]). If urinary PBG is substantially elevated, treatment should not be delayed while awaiting the results of further testing to determine the specific type of porphyria, especially in acutely ill patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>). Details of PBG testing are discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H178387\" class=\"local\">'Test urinary PBG and initiate treatment if positive'</a> below.)<br/><br/>Subsequent biochemical testing can be done after treatment is started, preferably using samples obtained before treatment is started. Of note, this subsequent analysis may take days or weeks, depending on available laboratory resources.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Determine the type of acute porphyria </strong>&ndash; Once the patient is determined to have a substantial PBG elevation, the specific diagnosis of AIP, HCP, or VP can be established by biochemical testing of urine (for ALA, PBG, and porphyrins), plasma and stool (for porphyrins). In order to ensure the most accurate results, samples should be collected before treatment is initiated because therapy (especially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>) reduces the levels of these intermediates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 4</a>). In practice, urinary PBG and some or all of this additional biochemical testing is often ordered simultaneously before treatment with hemin. Measuring creatinine on the same sample is helpful, since a very dilute sample may give a falsely low PBG value, and results can be expressed per gram of creatinine.

This information is useful for the management of patients who have recurring attacks after known exacerbating factors have been addressed, a setting in which management may be especially challenging. It is also useful to measure &quot;baseline&quot; PBG levels between attacks for comparison. However, in individuals with a known diagnosis of AIP, subsequent acute attacks are often similar to past attacks, and the diagnosis of an acute attack is confirmed clinically (ie, based on symptoms rather than biochemical testing). Treatment of an acute attack in a patient with known AIP should not be delayed while awaiting the results of PBG levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-management#H27078974\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Management&quot;, section on 'Establish presence of an acute attack'</a>.)</p><p/><p>This testing is described in more detail in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178387\"><span class=\"h3\">Test urinary PBG and initiate treatment if positive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening of a patient with suspected acute porphyria is done with a spot (random) urine sample, which should be assessed for PBG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>). Urine is tested first because these intermediates are increased in urine in all of the three most common acute porphyrias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a patient with renal failure, plasma or serum PBG can be measured instead of urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,46</a>]. A sample obtained at the time of the acute attack before therapy is the most reliable for this testing because therapy (especially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>) can lower production and levels of these intermediates in plasma and urine. Porphyrins are also measured on the urine sample, but if the PBG is elevated, a porphyrin result is not required to initiate treatment.</p><p>PBG measurement is the most important test for determining whether the patient has one of the three most common acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, or VP). <strong>Substantially elevated urinary PBG </strong>(eg, &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> or &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine) <strong>is highly sensitive and specific for these acute porphyrias and is sufficient for initiating treatment</strong>, regardless of the results of subsequent testing to determine which of the acute porphyrias is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-management#H3098728\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Management&quot;, section on 'Therapy for an acute attack'</a> and <a href=\"#H178394\" class=\"local\">'Obtain plasma and stool samples during the acute attack'</a> below.) </p><p>Urinary PBG can be measured on a spot urine sample in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid qualitative or quantitative</strong> <strong>test for elevated PBG</strong> &ndash; Elevated urinary PBG can be established using an inexpensive kit for rapid, semi-quantitative determination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Results are based on color change (ie, positive at several different levels or negative) and are reliable and available within minutes on-site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. However, this kit is no longer marketed in the US and many other countries. Therefore, it is necessary to have a rapid method for urine PBG measurement available on-site, or to ask referral laboratories how rapidly a quantitative result can be obtained. The value of a rapid result is in the ability to initiate immediate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> based on a positive result, or to provide strong evidence against AIP, HCP, and VP if the result is negative. Delays in therapy for critically ill patients may occur when a rapid test is not available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Regardless of results from the rapid test, we perform quantitative PBG and porphyrin measurements (send out tests at most institutions) using the same sample. The original spot urine (or an aliquot) should be submitted to a laboratory that will carry out both determinations on one sample.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quantitative measurement (send-out test)</strong> &ndash; In many medical centers, a send-out test for PBG measurement may be the only way to measure urinary PBG, and results may take one to two weeks. If this is the only PBG test available, the laboratory should be made aware of the urgency of testing. We also obtain quantitative PBG porphyrin measurement in patients evaluated by a rapid qualitative method, in order to quantitate levels for those with a positive qualitative result, and to identify a rare patient with a negative test kit result. Measurement of urine creatinine is also important, because a very dilute sample obtained, after initial hydration with oral or intravenous fluids may show a misleadingly low PBG concentration even during an acute attack. Quantitative urinary PBG testing is also accompanied by testing of urinary porphyrins and ALA, with porphyrin fractionation if total porphyrins are elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Substantial urinary PBG elevation is sufficient to initiate therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>. </p><p/><p>Non-urgent urine testing for porphyrins and ALA is also performed at the time of PBG measurement. Elevated urinary porphyrins not accompanied by PBG elevation is a nonspecific finding; is not diagnostic for acute porphyria; and, while this may be seen during recovery of an attack of HCP or VP, such patients rarely require urgent treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>. ALA is elevated, but less-so than PBG, in the three most common acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, and VP). Urine ALA is also increased in the least common acute porphyria, ALA dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP), as well as other disorders in which ALAD activity is diminished such as lead poisoning. Results of this urine testing are interpreted along with results of plasma and stool porphyrin testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 5</a>). Importantly, however, this additional testing is <strong>not</strong> required to exclude AIP, HCP, and VP if urinary PBG and total porphyrins were normal at or near the time of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H178394\" class=\"local\">'Obtain plasma and stool samples during the acute attack'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27589549\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Measuring creatinine in the spot urine sample is also recommended so that results can be expressed per gram of creatinine. Results expressed per gram of creatinine on a spot urine sample are as useful as results from a 24-hour collection unless the spot sample is very dilute, since the effects of aggressive hydration on the relative amounts of urinary PBG and creatinine have not been studied in patients with acute porphyrias.</p><p>If initial urine testing is negative but concern for AIP remains (eg, samples obtained after partial symptom resolution or treatment initiation), urine testing can be repeated when symptoms recur. Depending on the degree of suspicion for AIP and other acute porphyrias, biochemical testing can also be done during asymptomatic periods; in this setting, testing must be more comprehensive. (See <a href=\"#H7642424\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178394\"><span class=\"h3\">Obtain plasma and stool samples during the acute attack</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing of plasma and stool porphyrins, preferably before treatment, is required to distinguish among AIP and the other acute porphyrias (HCP, VP, ADP); this is done when a symptomatic patient is found to have a substantial increase in urine PBG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> porphyrins. These tests are available from all major commercial laboratories. Characteristic patterns for AIP and other porphyrias are presented in the table. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 4</a>)</p><p>Spot samples obtained at the time of acute symptoms (before treatment) are most reliable; however, obtaining these samples should not delay treatment in a patient who is acutely ill and has a substantial elevation in urinary PBG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ALA (or a history of these findings). Results from a spot fecal sample obtained one to two days after starting treatment are likely to be accurate, depending on intestinal transport time. If samples were not obtained during the acute attack, these can be obtained during a subsequent attack; alternatively, comprehensive biochemical testing with or without DNA testing can be done during asymptomatic periods. (See <a href=\"#H7642424\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Results consistent with AIP include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma or serum</strong> &ndash; AIP is characterized by increased plasma or serum ALA and PBG, especially during exacerbations, but less so than urine, along with normal or slightly elevated total plasma porphyrins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 5</a>).

In individuals who are asymptomatic at the time of testing, measurement of urinary PBG, ALA, and total porphyrins may be useful if positive, but results are less likely to be positive than at the time of symptoms. If results are negative, further evaluation depends on clinical suspicion and elimination of other possible causes of the symptoms, and may include plasma porphyrins, fecal porphyrins, and erythrocyte PBGD activity; gene sequencing may also be performed, but this is also likely to be more costly than biochemical analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H178387\" class=\"local\">'Test urinary PBG and initiate treatment if positive'</a> above and <a href=\"#H178394\" class=\"local\">'Obtain plasma and stool samples during the acute attack'</a> above and <a href=\"#H177669\" class=\"local\">'Confirmatory testing'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An individual may be asymptomatic but learn that a porphobilinogen <span class=\"nowrap\">deaminase/hydroxymethylbilane</span> synthase <span class=\"nowrap\">(PBGD/HMBS)</span> mutation has been identified in a family member. In this setting, DNA testing specifically for the known familial mutation should be used because it is more cost effective and specific than the biochemical testing described above for patients with acute symptoms. Individuals found to carry the familial mutation should have urinary PBG measured, since substantial elevation indicates a higher risk for becoming symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H177669\" class=\"local\">'Confirmatory testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If there is a family history of porphyria but a familial <span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</span> mutation has not been identified, evaluation of the index patient (ie, the family member with acute porphyria) should be pursued first to determine the type of porphyria and the mutation, if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Individuals identified to have a <span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</span> mutation should be counseled on preventive measures to avoid developing symptoms.

The advantage of identifying asymptomatic children who have inherited the familial mutation is that the risk of developing symptoms is present soon after puberty, and identification of a mutation can facilitate precautions to prevent attacks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diagnose and treat attacks promptly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-management#H1422388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Management&quot;, section on 'Prevention of attacks'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The decision to test is largely up to the parents, after considering the benefit of early diagnosis, the potential risks of discrimination regarding insurance and occupational opportunities, and the cost of DNA testing. Because the danger of attacks is low during childhood, such testing can be postponed until near puberty at the discretion of the parents. Ethical issues related to genetic testing of children are reviewed in more detail separately.

DNA testing is occasionally negative in the case of mutations in non-coding regions of the gene. Large deletions may not be recognized by gene sequencing. Thus, we prefer to test both for erythrocyte PBGD enzyme activity and gene mutations if possible.</p><p>Of note, PBGD deficiency can be identified in a fetus by measuring the enzyme activity or by identifying the parental DNA mutation in amniotic fluid cells. However, this is seldom done and usually not indicated, because the great majority of individuals with <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutations remain asymptomatic during their lifetime, and those who do become symptomatic typically do so after puberty; moreover, effective treatment is available for any attacks that may develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Importantly, findings from confirmatory testing cannot be used to distinguish between latent and active AIP or to identify an acute attack. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676247\"><span class=\"h3\">PBGD activity (erythrocytes)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PBGD activity is measured in erythrocytes because <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutations typically affect enzymatic activity of both the ubiquitous and erythrocyte-specific forms of PBGD, and erythrocytes are the most accessible source for measuring cytosolic heme pathway enzymes. PBGD activity testing is less expensive and more widely available than DNA testing. </p><p>Erythrocyte PBGD activity is approximately half-normal in most patients with AIP. Decreased PBGD activity in the appropriate clinical setting is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of AIP. However, PBGD activity is less accurate than DNA testing, for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is overlap between the wide ranges of activity for this enzyme in individuals with and without AIP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some <em>PBGD</em> mutations cause enzymatic activity to be deficient only in non-erythroid tissues.

(See <a href=\"#H10089479\" class=\"local\">'Enzymatic defect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>PBGD activity testing is also useful in rare AIP families without an identified mutation, because some mutations are not detected by gene sequencing (eg, large deletions or mutations in regulatory regions), although this is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676263\"><span class=\"h3\">DNA testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pathogenic variant (mutation) in the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> gene is identified by DNA testing (also called molecular testing or mutation analysis).

Identification of a pathogenic mutation not only confirms the diagnosis of AIP, but most importantly enables accurate identification of other gene carriers in a family. If DNA testing reveals a pathogenic <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutation in an individual who has never had symptoms and with a normal PBG level, we refer to this as latent AIP. (See <a href=\"#H291618\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Finding a specific mutation in an index patient with proven AIP is highly recommended before other family members are screened using DNA studies (as is the case for other acute porphyrias as well).

These terms should be clearly defined when used in clinical settings and publications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Manifest AIP</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of AIP is generally made by measuring deficient PBGD activity in erythrocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> identifying a <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutation in an individual with symptoms and biochemical findings consistent with AIP (ie, neurovisceral symptoms and substantially elevated urinary PBG, with little or no elevation in plasma and fecal porphyrins) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 5</a>). Both tests are not required for diagnosis. If only one confirmatory test can be done, DNA testing is more reliable. At least 95 percent of individuals with AIP will have a mutation in the <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> gene, and approximately 90 percent will have deficient activity of erythrocyte PBGD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Latent AIP</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of latent AIP is made by identifying a DNA mutation affecting PBGD activity in an individual without symptoms of AIP. The term &quot;latent&quot; is sometimes used for heterozygotes who have never had symptoms or PBG elevation and sometimes for individuals who had manifest AIP in the past but no symptoms for many years, with or without continued PBG elevation. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some individuals with a <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutation who have never had symptoms may have elevations in PBG that can be substantial; these are also considered clinically latent, and these individuals are sometimes referred to as &quot;asymptomatic high excreters.&quot; The latter term may also include asymptomatic individuals with persistently high levels of PBG who had symptoms of AIP in the past. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As noted above, an individual <strong>without </strong>AIP may have low erythrocyte PBGD activity without any clinical symptoms or <span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</span> mutation; in such cases, the diagnosis of latent AIP is not warranted. (See <a href=\"#H676247\" class=\"local\">'PBGD activity (erythrocytes)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27589549\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major considerations in the differential diagnosis of AIP are other causes of abdominal pain; other causes of neuropathic or neuropsychiatric symptoms; other causes of liver <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/abnormal</span> liver function tests; and other porphyrias. Like AIP, these conditions may present with nonspecific symptoms. Unlike AIP, non-porphyric conditions are associated with normal urinary PBG. Isolated elevation of urine porphyrins (ie, without increased ALA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PBG) is more suggestive of a non-porphyric condition rather than AIP; HCP and VP remain possible because urinary ALA and PBG can normalize rapidly in these conditions, which are excluded by further biochemical testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of abdominal pain</strong> &ndash; Abdominal pain can occur in numerous clinical settings. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), other causes of abdominal pain do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. However, other causes of abdominal pain may be associated with elevations in urinary porphyrins (eg, hepatobiliary disease) or ALA and porphyrins (eg, lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type 1). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, an individual with porphyria may present with another cause of abdominal pain (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis, inflammatory or ischemic bowel disease, biliary or renal stones), and these conditions can also precipitate an acute porphyria attack. Therefore, an elevated PBG does not exclude other causes of abdominal pain, and the presence of another cause of abdominal pain does not exclude AIP (or other acute porphyria). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of neuropathy</strong> &ndash; Neuropathies can have a variety of clinical presentations and etiologies. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), other causes of neuropathy (eg, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, which can mimic AIP) do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. However, lead poisoning causes neuropathy and elevations of urinary ALA and porphyrins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary neuropathies&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms</strong> &ndash; Neuropsychiatric symptoms can include anxiety, agitation, insomnia, hallucinations, seizures. There are many potential causes, including neurodegenerative disease, alcohol and drug use, psychiatric illness, and psychotropic medications. Like AIP, some of these other conditions may be associated with hyponatremia from the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), and abnormalities on neuroimaging may be seen. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), these other causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms do not cause elevations of urinary PBG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of seizures</strong> &ndash; Seizures may occur in a setting of acute medical illness including hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, uremia, and drug or alcohol intake. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), these other causes of seizures do not cause elevations in PBG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/abnormal</span> liver function tests</strong> &ndash; Liver disease due to any cause may be associated with elevated urinary porphyrin excretion, especially coproporphyrin. This occurs because coproporphyrin is normally excreted in both bile and urine, and urinary excretion of coproporphyrin increases when hepatobiliary function is impaired. Patients with liver disease may also have slight elevations in ALA. Unlike AIP (or other acute porphyrias), liver disease is not associated with elevated urinary PBG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other acute porphyrias</strong> &ndash; Like AIP, other acute porphyrias can cause acute neurovisceral attacks characterized by abdominal, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and increases in urinary PBG, ALA, and porphyrins. Unlike AIP, other acute porphyrias, which include HCP, VP, and ADP, have different patterns of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins in urine, plasma or serum, and stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 4</a>). HCP and VP may also have blistering skin manifestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51032 \">table 1</a>); however, the absence of skin manifestations does not exclude HCP or VP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, as noted above, it is <strong>not</strong> necessary to differentiate AIP from other acute porphyrias before treatment is started, because all acute porphyrias are treated in the same manner during an acute attack; however, samples needed for distinguishing among acute porphyrias should be collected before treatment if possible. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>HCP</strong> &ndash; Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is an acute porphyria like AIP; both HCP and AIP are characterized by elevated urinary PBG, especially during an acute attack. However, PBG elevation in HCP may be less marked and more transient than in AIP. Unlike AIP, HCP can have blistering photosensitivity, although this is rare. Unlike AIP, HCP is characterized by substantially increased fecal porphyrins, with predominance of coproporphyrin III. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-coproporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary coproporphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>VP</strong> &ndash; Variegate porphyria (VP) is an acute porphyria like AIP; both VP and AIP are characterized by elevated urinary PBG, especially during an acute attack. PBG elevation may be less marked and more transient in VP than in AIP. Unlike AIP, VP also commonly causes blistering photosensitivity. VP is characterized by substantially increased fecal porphyrins, with a predominance of coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin; in VP, plasma porphyrins are increased with a characteristic peak fluorescence at approximately 626 nm when plasma is diluted at neutral pH, which distinguishes VP from all other types of porphyria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variegate-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variegate porphyria&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>ADP</strong> &ndash; 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) porphyria (ADP) is an acute porphyria like AIP. ADP is extremely rare. Unlike AIP (or HCP or VP), ADP is characterized by elevated urinary ALA rather than PBG, as well as markedly increased urinary coproporphyrin III and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ala-dehydratase-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ALA dehydratase porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cutaneous porphyrias</strong> &ndash; Rarely, cutaneous porphyrias, which do not cause neurovisceral symptoms but do cause increased porphyrin levels, may be misdiagnosed as AIP in a patient who presents with coincidental abdominal pain or neurological symptoms that are unrelated to the cutaneous porphyria. Unlike AIP (or HCP or VP), cutaneous porphyrias are associated with normal urinary PBG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89035\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89035 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89123\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89123 \">algorithm 3</a>) and have diagnostic patterns of porphyrins in urine, plasma, erythrocytes, and stool.

It is caused by an inherited deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase [HMBS]), the third enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 3</a>). AIP is an autosomal dominant disease with low penetrance (ie, most patients who inherit the mutation never have symptoms). (See <a href=\"#H10088072\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10090359\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute attacks of AIP are usually associated with one or more exacerbating factors, such as medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 2</a>), smoking, sex hormones (eg, progesterone), reduced caloric or carbohydrate intake (especially fasting), and stress. (See <a href=\"#H10089552\" class=\"local\">'Exacerbating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of AIP are due to neurologic dysfunction, which may include a combination of sensory, motor, enteric and autonomic nervous system abnormalities. The resulting neurovisceral symptoms can include abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and extremity weakness and pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56856 \">table 3</a>). Hypertension, hyponatremia, seizures, quadriplegia, or respiratory paralysis may be life-threatening, requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. The neurovisceral symptoms of AIP are identical to other acute porphyrias. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIP (or other acute porphyria) should be suspected in an adult of any ethnic background with otherwise unexplained neurovisceral symptoms, especially if previous similar and recurrent symptoms have been reported. A negative family history is not helpful in excluding the diagnosis of AIP, because symptomatic disease may skip generations. Delays in diagnosis are common. (See <a href=\"#H115704392\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a previously undiagnosed patient with acute symptoms consistent with AIP (or other acute porphyria), we use a stepwise approach to diagnostic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>). The most useful results are obtained from samples obtained during the acute attack before treatment is initiated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) is tested first; elevated urinary PBG is highly sensitive and specific for the three most common acute porphyrias (AIP, hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], variegate porphyria [VP]) and is sufficient for initiating treatment, which is the same for all acute porphyrias. Rapid testing for elevated urinary PBG should be available for prompt diagnosis or exclusion of these three porphyrias, especially in the presence of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H178387\" class=\"local\">'Test urinary PBG and initiate treatment if positive'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-management#H3098728\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Management&quot;, section on 'Therapy for an acute attack'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Additional diagnostic testing is done, preferably from samples obtained before treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>, to distinguish among AIP, HCP, and VP, and to identify the fourth acute porphyria (delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria [ADP]), which is extremely rare. This testing includes urinary ALA, PBG, and porphyrins, and plasma and stool porphyrins. Urinary porphyrins are fractionated if the total urinary porphyrins are elevated. Urine PBG and total porphyrin testing is ordered first; if these results are normal, no further testing is needed to exclude AIP, HCP, and VP. If urinary PBG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> porphyrins are elevated, plasma and fecal porphyrins are measured; these tests are likely to have, long turnaround times (ie, weeks) at most centers. If PBG is substantially elevated, plasma and stool samples can be obtained and sent for porphyrin measurements while treatment with hemin is started. (See <a href=\"#H178394\" class=\"local\">'Obtain plasma and stool samples during the acute attack'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The diagnosis of AIP is confirmed by a finding of decreased erythrocyte PBG deaminase (PBGD) activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a mutation in the gene encoding PBGD, also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS). We prefer to perform both confirmatory tests if possible. (See <a href=\"#H177669\" class=\"local\">'Confirmatory testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H291618\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic family members and children of <em><span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</em></span> mutation carriers are diagnosed by DNA testing. Measuring erythrocyte PBGD activity is less expensive and less reliable. An individual with a gene mutation but no symptoms is referred to as having latent AIP; this is much more common than symptomatic AIP. (See <a href=\"#H7642424\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H291618\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10088072\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major considerations in the differential diagnosis of AIP are other causes of abdominal pain; other causes of neuropathy (eg, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome); other causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms or seizures; liver disease; other acute porphyrias (ADP, HCP, VP); and, rarely, cutaneous porphyrias presenting with a concurrent condition causing abdominal pain or neuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51032 \">table 1</a>).
