Aspirin in the former group is termed &quot;primary prevention&quot; and in the latter, &quot;secondary prevention.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> as a preventive intervention is not given in some patients who have been identified as having a sensitivity to it or to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> sensitivity is particularly problematic for patients who need an urgent or emergent cardiac or neurologic procedure, such as stenting of an artery (coronary, carotid, or other) or following the diagnosis of an ischemic neurologic event. This topic will discuss an approach for safely introducing low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg daily) to patients with one or more types of NSAID hypersensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H401029906\" class=\"local\">'Patients who require urgent aspirin therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2011719310\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAID hypersensitivity is a relatively complicated area of drug allergy, with six distinct types of hypersensitivity reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). These can be divided into two general categories of reactions: those that occur with multiple NSAIDs (types 1 to 4) and those sensitivities with just one NSAID (types 5 and 6) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). However, patients with any of these reactions can be treated with the approach discussed in this topic, and in-depth knowledge of these reactions is not necessary to manage patients requiring low-dose aspirin. Of note, there are other forms of NSAID hypersensitivity that are contraindications to any future use of aspirin, and these are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2388287559\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p>The term &quot;desensitization&quot; is used throughout this topic to refer to the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> to a patient who is known or suspected to have a hypersensitivity. The goal of desensitization is to allow for the successful use of daily aspirin. However, this is a somewhat inaccurate use of the term, which should technically be applied only to situations in which the patient is known conclusively to have a hypersensitivity. Despite this, the term &quot;desensitization&quot; is used for convenience in this topic. NSAID hypersensitivity, as well as the various challenge and desensitization protocols used by drug allergy specialists to diagnose and treat these reactions, are discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-challenge-and-desensitization-protocols-for-nsaid-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic challenge and desensitization protocols for NSAID reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401029906\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WHO REQUIRE URGENT ASPIRIN THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following patients may need to have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> started on an urgent basis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those suspected of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or an ischemic neurologic event with revascularization not planned</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those suspected of ACS or an acute ischemic neurologic event with revascularization planned or already executed with stent placement, in whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> was not started due to concerns about hypersensitivity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those presenting for nonurgent coronary artery revascularization, who have not been taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278693140\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach can be summarized as follows:</p><p>Low-dose (75 to 100 mg daily) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> can be introduced safely in patients who report aspirin allergy (hypersensitivity), using the standardized protocol that takes between three and five hours to perform and is presented here (see <a href=\"#H2011329982\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization procedure'</a> below). The protocol can be carried out as an outpatient, prior to an elective stenting procedure, or as an inpatient, either before or after the procedure, based upon the patient's stability and the urgency with which the procedure is required. Based on one of the author's (RS) extensive clinical experience, this approach is nearly always successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-of-aspirin-to-patients-with-aspirin-hypersensitivity-requiring-cardiovascular-interventions/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>However, we defer desensitization in patients who are medically unstable and who could not tolerate a severe reaction to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. This is particularly true for those whose past reactions included respiratory symptoms because aspirin can induce a significant bronchospastic reaction (drop in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] of 50 percent or more) in some patients with asthma. This is usually blunted by premedication prior to the protocol, but some bronchospasm can still occur, and both the bronchospasm and the inhaled beta-agonists used to treat it can further stress a fragile patient. When the cardiologist feels the patient can be given beta-agonists safely, we prefer to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levalbuterol</a>, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>.</p><p>The first steps are taking a detailed history of the patient's past reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), categorizing the most likely type of past reaction (ie, cutaneous, respiratory, or other), and determining if the patient could have underlying aspirin-exacerbated asthma or respiratory disease (AERD). Identifying AERD is important because patients with this disorder can have severe respiratory reactions to aspirin and should be premedicated before aspirin is introduced. (See <a href=\"#H3722684136\" class=\"local\">'Premedication agents and doses'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2161344570\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of aspirin introduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protocol discussed here for introduction of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> requires between three and five hours to complete, and the patient may develop some symptoms during it, although they should be mild. Thus, the patient's clinical status determines when the procedure can be performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For aspirin-sensitive patients who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) <strong>prior</strong> to desensitization, the optimal antithrombotic approach is not known. Our experts use one of the following two approaches, which have not been formally evaluated, in patients who cannot be desensitized before the procedure:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administer a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker alone. With this approach, most experts prefer one of the more potent agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a>, to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>.

Factors that contribute to the safety of this approach include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> doses given in this protocol are too low to induce symptoms in many patients with true hypersensitivity to aspirin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients reporting past reactions to NSAIDs are not currently sensitive to these medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> has never been convincingly shown to cause immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated anaphylaxis (although it can cause very severe respiratory reactions that resemble anaphylaxis in patients with AERD who have not been premedicated). (See <a href=\"#H3591871321\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2010705923\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach described here is usually carried out by allergists, although it can be administered by clinicians who are not allergy specialists. Consultation with an allergist is strongly advised if the patient's past reaction to NSAIDs was life-threatening or the clinician is not sure how to categorize the past reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1355459703\"><span class=\"h2\">Categorize the type of NSAID hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When asking about <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> hypersensitivity, it is important to ask patients if they have had problems with any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, etc) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62880 \">table 2</a>). Reactions to multiple NSAIDs narrows the diagnosis to hypersensitivity types 1 to 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). These forms of hypersensitivity are not immunologic reactions but rather are biochemical reactions due to an abnormal response to inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, and they occur with all NSAIDs at a sufficient dose. Therefore, when taking the clinical history, it is best to inquire about all NSAIDs to gather all the relevant information. (See <a href=\"#H300891335\" class=\"local\">'Important questions in the clinical history'</a> below.)</p><p>All of the types of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> hypersensitivity reactions included in the table are amenable to the approach discussed in this topic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). However, it is important for clinicians to identify patients who are likely to have underlying AERD, also called NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD), because these patients require premedication to minimize the asthmatic component of a possible reaction. Without premedication, these reactions can be severe, involving significant bronchospasm and other symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3722684136\" class=\"local\">'Premedication agents and doses'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H300891335\"><span class=\"h3\">Important questions in the clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is helpful to ask the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did you have an unwanted reaction to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in the past? What exactly happened? What dose was taken?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> hypersensitivity will either describe cutaneous symptoms (ie, hives, angioedema) or reactions that involve respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, chest tightness, severe nasal congestion, flushing) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). Known side effects of aspirin (gastrointestinal pain, tinnitus, or bleeding) are not hypersensitivity reactions, and many patients with these reactions in the past can tolerate low-dose aspirin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Respiratory reactions may be accompanied by throat tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms. True IgE-mediated anaphylaxis can occur with a variety of NSAIDs (type 6), although it has never been conclusively demonstrated to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> specifically. (See <a href=\"#H60140669\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you reacted to other NSAIDs in the past? Are there NSAIDs that you can take without problems?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Different types of NSAIDs are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62880 \">table 2</a>). Patients who have reacted similarly to two or more NSAIDs have types 1 to 4 hypersensitivity. These individuals would probably have the same reaction to higher-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (325 or 500 mg) but may tolerate low-dose aspirin. Patients who reacted to one NSAID but tolerate others likely have types 5 or 6 hypersensitivity to a single agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How was the reaction treated?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The answer to this question helps the clinician estimate the severity of the past reaction. Severe reactions may have required emergency care or hospitalization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the initial reaction, have you taken the culprit drug or any other NSAID again? What do you take for pain or fever?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The answer to this question may provide further information about the patient's ability to tolerate different NSAIDs. Patients who were told to avoid all NSAIDs sometimes unknowingly take some other medication in the NSAID group, thus providing information about whether they are reactive to just one NSAID or multiple agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have asthma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of sinus problems?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This question should identify patients with AERD, which is the combination of asthma, chronic sinusitis (with nasal polyps), and NSAID hypersensitivity. These patients have types 1 or 4 reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). Patients with AERD most commonly have respiratory reactions to NSAIDS but occasionally have a mixture of respiratory and cutaneous reactions. These individuals should be premedicated prior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> desensitization because they may react during it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you had hives (urticaria)? If the patient reports hives, how frequently? Does the patient think there are clear triggers?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) have unexplained urticaria most days of the week for a period of six weeks or more, although the problem can be quiescent for months or years at a time. CSU affects approximately 1 percent of the adult population. Angioedema (usually of the lip or face) accompanies some urticarial outbreaks in up to 50 percent of affected patients. Patients reporting hives or angioedema with NSAIDs who have underlying CSU are classified as having type 2 hypersensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F90304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90304 \">table 1</a>). These patients do not require premedication before initiation of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, but if they are already taking daily H1 antihistamines, these should be continued, because stopping antihistamines suddenly may cause an exacerbation of CSU.

For example, the patient may initially have sinus problems, followed after several years by the development of asthma, and then some years after that by adverse reactions to NSAIDs. Patients with AERD may also report severe nasal congestion after drinking alcoholic beverages, which can be a clue to the presence of the disorder. AERD is reviewed in greater detail separately.

In the absence of premedication, the asthmatic component of these reactions can be severe and can resemble anaphylaxis, although the mechanism is not IgE-mediated. It is important to identify these patients and premedicate them for the procedure because premedication blunts the severity of the pulmonary symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3722684136\" class=\"local\">'Premedication agents and doses'</a> below.)</p><p>NSAID reactions in patients with AERD are not immunologically-mediated, so unlike some forms of hypersensitivity, the patient may not react to very small doses of an NSAID. Some patients will react to 81 (or 100) mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and some will not. However, nearly all will react to 325 mg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H386069503\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous reactions to NSAIDs are common and usually involve urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema.

The protocol should <strong>not</strong> be aborted if these occur. Instead, the symptoms should be treated as described below. As soon as the symptoms have subsided, the dose that caused the reaction is repeated until the patient no longer reacts (usually the patient does not react when the same dose is given a second time). The protocol is then continued until complete. If the reaction was limited to a few hives, we usually treat the symptoms but do not repeat the triggering dose, and just continue with the protocol until complete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchospasm (repetitive dry cough, chest tightness, or wheezing) can be treated with inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levalbuterol</a> (preferred in patients with cardiac disease, 1 to 2 inhalations of a metered dose inhaler or 0.63 mg nebulized) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> or another short-acting bronchodilator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urticaria can be treated with H1 antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> 10 mg orally or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> 25 to 50 mg orally or intravenously).

The most common situation in which this might occur is in an inpatient scheduled to undergo PCI within the next five or so days. In this case, the procedure can be extended another three to four hours using a second protocol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112849\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112849 \">algorithm 2</a>). If the second protocol is performed on the same day as the first, patients with past respiratory reactions do not need repeat premedications. However, if the second protocol is performed more than 24 hours later, premedications should be given again. <strong>Most patients with AERD will react during desensitization to this higher dose</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H1827005373\" class=\"local\">'Treating symptoms during the protocol'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients who can wait for more than five days for their procedure can be treated with five consecutive days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 75 to 80 mg daily, and this dose is less likely to elicit symptoms. Alternatively, the procedure for reaching the higher dose can be performed later by an allergist as an outpatient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1527752180\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A different protocol has been published, which does not attempt to distinguish among the different types of NSAID reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/introduction-of-aspirin-to-patients-with-aspirin-hypersensitivity-requiring-cardiovascular-interventions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It was studied in a multicenter trial that included 330 consecutive patients with self-reported histories of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> hypersensitivity. Patients' past reactions were reported to be urticaria or angioedema (74 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">rhinitis/asthma/bronchospasm</span> (20 percent), and anaphylactic shock (6 percent). An aspirin <span class=\"nowrap\">provocation/desensitization</span> procedure consisting of six increasing doses (highest dose 100 mg) given over 5.5 hours was performed in all patients, either prior to cardiac catheterization (76 percent) or after primary PCI (24 percent). No premedications were administered. If the patient reacted, the symptoms were treated, and the procedure was aborted. The procedure was successful in 95 percent of the patients, and all were discharged on 100 mg of aspirin daily. Aspirin therapy was discontinued in 18 percent during the first year of treatment, although this was not due to hypersensitivity in any case.</p><p>An important limitation of this protocol is the recommendation to abort the procedure if symptoms develop because patients with AERD may develop symptoms during desensitization but can be successfully treated through these symptoms. Most AERD patients react to doses between 60 and 120 mg, so not all patients will react to low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, but those who do can still tolerate aspirin if the symptoms are treated and the procedure is continued.

However, low-dose aspirin (ie, 75 to 100 mg) can be safely introduced to most patients in this situation using a simple protocol.
