It almost invariably involves the rectum, and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other portions of the colon. </p><p>Patients with severe presentations of ulcerative colitis are generally categorized as having either severe or fulminant ulcerative colitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a severe ulcerative colitis have frequent loose bloody stools (&ge;6 per day) with severe cramps and evidence of systemic toxicity as demonstrated by a fever (temperature &ge;37.5&deg;C), tachycardia (heart rate [HR] &ge;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute),</span> anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span>. Patients may have rapid weight loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fulminant colitis refers to a subgroup of patients with severe ulcerative colitis who have more than 10 stools per day, continuous bleeding, abdominal pain, distension, and acute, severe toxic symptoms including fever and anorexia. Such patients are at risk of progressing to toxic megacolon and bowel perforation. </p><p/><p>This topic will review the management of severe and fulminant ulcerative colitis. The management of mild to moderate colitis, steroid-refractory and steroid-dependant ulcerative colitis, and toxic megacolon are discussed separately.

It is also important to exclude alternative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> comorbid conditions as a cause for their symptoms even when the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis has been previously established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H1226801754\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Assessment of clinical severity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H350978455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation should consist of laboratory studies including blood counts, liver tests, measurement of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), stool studies to rule out an infectious colitis, and a limited evaluation of the colon with flexible sigmoidoscopy to confirm the presence, severity, and extent of inflammation, and to obtain biopsies to exclude the presence of an infection (eg, cytomegalovirus). A full colonoscopy should be avoided in hospitalized patients with severe colitis because of the potential to precipitate toxic megacolon. Because of the severity of symptoms, treatment should proceed pending the results of investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H350978455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with severe or fulminant ulcerative colitis should also undergo plain abdominal radiography both at presentation and at any time there is clinical deterioration to determine if there is colonic dilation (diameter &ge;5.5 cm) or toxic megacolon (diameter &ge;6 cm or cecum &gt;9 cm and systemic toxicity). The management of toxic megacolon is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach is fundamental to the successful management of all patients with severe ulcerative colitis. When possible, patients should be managed with aggressive medical therapy, though in some surgery will be required. In addition to proper nutritional assessment and support, a colorectal surgeon should be contacted and involved early in the patient's admission. Surgery is indicated for patients who have life-threatening complications of severe ulcerative colitis, such as massive bleeding, perforation, or infection. It may also be necessary for those who have fulminant or chronic severe colitis that fails to improve with intravenous steroids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biologic therapy. It is important the patient be comfortable that all reasonable medical therapy has been attempted prior to considering colectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1133536041\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF SEVERE ULCERATIVE COLITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a severe ulcerative colitis have frequent loose bloody stools (&ge;6 per day) with severe cramps and evidence of systemic toxicity as demonstrated by a fever (temperature &ge;37.5&deg;C), tachycardia (heart rate [HR] &ge;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute),</span> anemia (hemoglobin &lt;10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span>.

Initiation of oral glucocorticoids should not be delayed until the results of stool studies and cultures are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1133540027\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Although there are no randomized controlled trials to support the use of oral 5-ASA medications in severe colitis, clinical experience along with their documented benefit in patients with milder symptoms suggests that oral 5-ASA medications may be a helpful adjunct in the management of patients with severe colitis. However, in rare cases, some 5-ASA medications have been found to cause exacerbations of colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If an ulcerative colitis flare coincides with a recent increase in dose or addition of an oral 5-ASA medication, oral 5-ASA medications should be discontinued. </p><p>No randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a benefit to topical therapy in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. However, we have found that steroid <span class=\"nowrap\">enemas/foam</span> and suppositories or 5-ASA enemas twice daily may be helpful in relieving rectal symptoms of tenesmus and urgency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H113301576\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis'</a>.)</p><p>Anticholinergic, antidiarrheal agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioid drugs should be discontinued in patients with severe colitis due to the risk of precipitating toxic megacolon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We recommend intravenous antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>) in patients with severe colitis and high grade fever, leukocytosis with extreme numbers of immature neutrophils (band form count greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">700/microL),</span> and peritoneal signs or megacolon.

Although bowel rest can help reduce stool volume, it has no established benefit on disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Nutritional support should be considered in patients who are malnourished. In such cases, enteral nutrition is preferred, as it is associated with significantly fewer complications than parenteral nutrition and does not deprive the colon of short chain fatty acids needed for the metabolism and repair of colon epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Prednisolone or methylprednisolone are preferred because they are associated with less sodium-retention and potassium-wasting. A systematic review of 32 trials and cohort studies of intravenous glucocorticoids included 1991 patients with acute severe colitis between 1974 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The overall response rate (both partial and complete) to glucocorticoids was 67 percent; 27 percent of patients required a colectomy. Continuous infusions of intravenous glucocorticoids are not safer or more effective than bolus injection in achieving clinical remission in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>We suggest broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients who improve but do not fully respond to glucocorticoids, and who continue to run low grade fevers with evidence of band forms in their differential.
