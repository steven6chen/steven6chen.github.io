However, there is considerable individual variability in the onset and extent of these changes. Nevertheless, even the healthy older adult has reduced physiologic reserve, and organ systems may be compromised during illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical stress. The following physiologic changes specifically impact anesthetic care, in large part by increasing susceptibility to anesthetic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H251746700\"><span class=\"h2\">Nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-related changes in the central and peripheral nervous system affect the older adult's response to anesthetics and other medications, as well as the perception of pain.</p><p>Central nervous system changes include reduction in brain size and neuronal density and widening of the sulci and ventricles. Regional reductions in neurotransmitters (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>, serotonin, and acetylcholine) and neuroreceptors may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Pharmacodynamic sensitivity increases with age for all intravenous agents that act within the central nervous system (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>). Furthermore, there is an age-related decrease in the minimum alveolar concentration at 1 atmosphere preventing movement in 50 percent of patients exposed to a surgical incision (termed &quot;MAC&quot;) for all volatile anesthetic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, a decrease in cholinergic receptor activity may explain the older patient's vulnerability to the anticholinergic side effects of medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The normal ventilatory response of the central nervous system to hypercapnia, and especially to hypoxemia, is diminished with age. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids, benzodiazepines, and volatile anesthetics are exaggerated in older adults and may further impair the response hypercapnia and hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Changes in the peripheral nervous system include a reduction in myelinated fibers, with potential alterations in pain perception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Higher pain thresholds have been observed in older patients and may contribute to delayed presentation for painful conditions such as acute appendicitis and peritonitis. Finally, although the mechanisms are not clear, it is known that postoperative central nervous system complications, particularly postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive deficits, are primarily a problem in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H183401056\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183400890\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal changes in the older adult's cardiovascular system, such as vascular stiffening and autonomic changes, influence the physiologic response to anesthetic administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Labile blood pressure is common in the anesthetized older adult, and significant hypotension requiring treatment often develops in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Vascular stiffening in older age leads to a gradual increase in blood pressure and renders the vascular system less elastic. These vascular changes increase impedance to left ventricular (LV) outflow, causing an increase in LV work and, ultimately, LV hypertrophy. The myocardium becomes stiffer and diastolic filling is impaired. In fact, frank diastolic dysfunction is present in approximately half of patients over 65 years of age with a known diagnosis of congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. These patients may be extremely dependent upon the atrial contribution to filling during diastole (the &quot;atrial kick&quot;). Thus, even brief episodes of atrial arrhythmias during anesthesia may result in development of significant hypotension. Furthermore, diastolic dysfunction increases the risk of development of pulmonary edema during fluid administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/21,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-25</a>].</p><p>Older adult patients also have autonomic changes, collectively referred to as the &quot;dysautonomia of aging.&quot; Impaired beta receptor responsiveness limits the ability to increase cardiac output by increasing heart rate, so that the patient is more reliant on vascular tone and preload.</p><p>These age-related changes in the cardiovascular system combine to result in greater blood pressure lability and more episodes of perioperative hypotension in older patients compared with young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Furthermore, hypotension is exacerbated by most anesthetic agents, which cause systemic vasodilation. In addition, certain anesthetic techniques, such as spinal anesthesia or an epidural infusion with a local anesthetic agent, may decrease systemic blood pressure due to vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Finally, certain surgical techniques may contribute to hypotension (eg, laparoscopic insufflation of the abdomen, which reduces venous return).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183400896\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal aging of the pulmonary system decreases overall pulmonary reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. As a result, older adults are more susceptible to respiratory compromise in the postoperative period and during monitored anesthesia care.</p><p>Changes in the respiratory system include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiffening of the chest wall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased elasticity of lung parenchyma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased compliance and closing capacity of the smaller airways</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in baseline PaO<sub>2</sub></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased alveolar-arterial gradient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> (VQ) mismatch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired pharyngeal function </p><p/><p>Increased stiffening of the chest wall and decreased elasticity of the lung parenchyma are predictable changes, which increase the work of breathing. In addition, increased compliance of the smaller airways in older patients, as well as increased closing capacity, can lead to small airway collapse. Thus, there is a higher risk of atelectasis and consequent hypoxemia. In addition, impaired pharyngeal function predisposes some older patients to increased risk of aspiration and potential pulmonary complications.</p><p>The exaggerated respiratory depressant effects of opioids, benzodiazepines, and volatile anesthetics in older adults increase the risk of perioperative hypercapnia and hypoxemia, as well as postoperative apnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/15-17,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,28</a>]. This risk is exacerbated if reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) is inadequate, if the patient is frail and more susceptible to fatigue, or has certain comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H183401044\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14104275\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatic system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-related declines in hepatic mass and function, as well as decreased hepatic blood flow, result in slower metabolism of most intravenous drugs used in anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/11,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,30</a>]. In addition, diminished albumin levels may result in larger free-drug concentrations of highly protein bound drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183400902\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging causes a variable decline in glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, and renal functional reserve that may be underestimated by the serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Thus, the plasma concentration of renally excreted intravenous agents may be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/11,29,30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,30,33</a>]. Comorbidities common in older adults (eg, diabetes, hypertension, and vascular disease) can cause further decline in renal function. In addition, functional changes in the kidney alter the patient's ability to maximally dilute urine; thus, the older patient has decreased ability to handle a salt or water load. Finally, the older kidney is more prone to nephrotoxic effects of intravenous contrast or medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H251746247\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume of drug distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased total body water and increased adipose tissue in older adults result in changes in the volume of distribution and clearance of many anesthetics and other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/11,29,30,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,30,34,35</a>]. Thus, the effective concentration of anesthetic induction agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> is increased, due to a smaller initial volume of distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].<em> </em>Increased body fat also results in a prolonged effect of lipid-soluble drugs due to slow release from the relatively large adipose reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/11,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,30</a>].

Much of the perioperative risk associated with age is due to increasing likelihood of comorbidities that confer excess risk. However, the impact of absolute age on perioperative outcomes is modest and should not be used as a sole criterion to guide preoperative testing or withhold a surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Routine preoperative testing is not recommended, even in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. As an example, a prospective randomized trial in older patients having cataract surgery found no difference in complications in 9411 patients who received routine preoperative testing, compared with 9408 patients who received testing only as indicated by their medical condition(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Preoperative laboratory evaluation of the healthy patient is reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>).

These guidelines were based on the observation that older patients have a high incidence of preoperative changes on the ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>] despite data showing little predictive value of the preoperative ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In a prospective observational study of 513 older adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, 75 percent had at least one abnormality on the baseline ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, these abnormalities were not associated with increased risk for cardiac events.

These tests should be obtained selectively in older patients with a history of liver disease, anemia, bleeding and other hematologic disorders, or when the surgical procedure is likely to result in significant blood loss.

Often, a member of the anesthesia team will preview the patient's medical conditions and most recent laboratory tests in order to determine if further testing is likely to be useful. If not, the final preoperative assessment is completed on the day of surgery at the hospital or ambulatory center. In such cases, it is particularly important to communicate to the outside facility regarding instructions for timing the patient's nothing by mouth (NPO) status, and the need to administer or withhold each medication. Clear instructions are particularly important for anticoagulants, as these may ideally be discontinued several days before the surgical procedure.

Additional effort may be required to obtain a clear history as older adult patients may frequently forget or confuse their medication regimen.

In a 2014 review of systematic reviews of neuraxial versus general anesthesia, patients who had a neuraxial block had a lower incidence of pneumonia and reduced 0- to 30-day mortality (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.94; 20 studies, 3006 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In particular, older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may benefit from neuraxial anesthesia. In a review of COPD patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (SCIP) database, the investigators used propensity matching to compare general anesthesia (n = 2644 patients) with regional anesthesia (epidural, spinal, or peripheral nerve block; n = 2644 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Similarly, in a cohort study in 541 consecutive patients with known COPD who were undergoing major abdominal surgery, the investigators noted a reduction in pneumonia (11 versus 16 percent, OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-0.9) and mortality (5 versus 9 percent, OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.2) in those receiving epidural anesthesia (n = 324) versus general anesthesia alone (n = 217) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Epidural anesthesia may be beneficial in older patients with ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/73,74,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74,78</a>]. In the preoperative period, early administration of continuous epidural analgesia in elderly patients with known coronary artery disease was associated with a lower incidence of cardiac events before hip fracture surgery, compared with a control group who received intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In patients undergoing procedures requiring large thoracic or abdominal incisions, thoracic epidural that blocks cardiac accelerator sympathetic fibers attenuates any stress-induced increases in heart rate (HR), contractility, and preload, and also provides preemptive postoperative analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) defines MAC as a circumstance in which an anesthesiologist provides specific anesthesia services to a patient, while the patient receives local anesthesia or, in some cases, no anesthesia at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The standard of care for older patients undergoing MAC is the same as for patients undergoing general or regional anesthesia, including the preoperative assessment, standard intraoperative monitoring, and postoperative recovery care.</p><p>During the MAC technique, the anesthesiologist usually administers short-acting agents that provide analgesia, sedation, and anxiolysis, yet allow rapid recovery. However, progression from a &quot;light&quot; level of sedation to &quot;deep&quot; sedation (or unconsciousness) may occur rather suddenly, particularly in the older patient. Thus, vigilant monitoring and constant communication with the patient is required to avoid airway obstruction, hypoxemia, and even aspiration. In older adults with dementia or significant neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, the anesthesiologist may determine that it is not feasible to provide sedation only, and may recommend general anesthesia, even though the procedure may be minor.</p><p>Older patients are particularly susceptible to developing hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Thus, reduced doses of sedatives and narcotics are recommended. Furthermore, since older patients have a lower baseline PaO<sub>2</sub>, administration of supplemental oxygen is recommended to reduce the risk of hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. In addition, monitoring end tidal carbon dioxide levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiration is recommended in spontaneously breathing older patients, since significant hypercapnia may develop, even when oxygen saturation levels remain normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

We recommend invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring in older patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease or hemodynamic instability, or when the planned surgical procedure is likely to cause large sudden cardiovascular changes, rapid blood loss, or large fluid shifts. In addition, arterial access facilitates monitoring of laboratory results during complex invasive surgical procedures.</p><p>Central venous catheterization is considered when it is necessary to provide secure vascular access for the administration of vasoactive drugs or to initiate rapid fluid resuscitation.

This theory is supported by evidence that a large percentage of older adults undergoing surgery have preexisting cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/50,56,142,154\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,56,142,154</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183401062\"><span class=\"h3\">Hospital readmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After outpatient surgery, the rate of admission to an inpatient hospital within 30 days of the outpatient procedure was significantly higher in patients over age 80 in a large Medicare database study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After inpatient major noncardiac surgery in approximately 160,000 Medicare patients, the readmission rate was 8 percent in those without a preexisting diagnosis of heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].

On average, following major abdominal surgery, recovery to preoperative levels of function may require three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-older-adult/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183401068\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aging is associated with a progressive loss of functional reserve in all organ systems. However, the extent and onset of these physiologic changes are unique to each individual. (See <a href=\"#H183400878\" class=\"local\">'Impact of age-related physiologic changes on anesthetic care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generally, older patients are more susceptible to the effects of all intravenous and volatile anesthetic agents, and the duration of drug effect is often prolonged. Initial doses of intravenous anesthetic agents should be reduced, with a longer interval between repeat doses. The dose of all inhalational agents should also be decreased by approximately 6 percent per decade after age 40 years. (See <a href=\"#H183400878\" class=\"local\">'Impact of age-related physiologic changes on anesthetic care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Labile blood pressure and significant hypotension requiring treatment with a vasopressor agent are common in the anesthetized older patient. (See <a href=\"#H183400890\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory depressant effects of sedative and narcotic agents are exaggerated in older adults. In older patients undergoing general anesthesia, we recommend reduced doses of narcotics and other anesthetic drugs that depress respiration, as well as complete reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents, to minimize the risk of postoperative apnea and respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H183400896\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory system'</a> above and <a href=\"#H183401023\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to appropriate dosing, older patients undergoing procedures using the MAC technique require especially vigilant intraoperative monitoring of oxygen saturation and end tidal carbon dioxide levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiration. (See <a href=\"#H183400950\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and monitored anesthesia care (MAC)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative consultation is necessary in all older patients to assess severity of medical condition(s), risk of the proposed surgical procedure, and medication history. We suggest the following studies to evaluate medical comorbidities (see <a href=\"#H183400920\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of medical comorbidities'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrocardiogram (ECG) for patients with known cardiovascular risk factors undergoing intermediate or high cardiac risk surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest radiograph within the past six months in older patients undergoing high-risk surgery who have symptomatic cardiac or pulmonary disease suggested by clinical evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be obtained selectively in older patients with a history of liver disease, anemia, bleeding and other hematologic disorders, or when the surgical procedure is likely to result in significant blood loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative frailty (ie, decrease in physiological reserve that exceeds what might be expected from advanced age alone) is associated with increased risk for postoperative mortality, longer hospital stay, discharge to a skilled nursing facility, and functional decline. (See <a href=\"#H1720788754\" class=\"local\">'Frailty'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative dementia in older adults is associated with increased risk for postoperative delirium and other morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H1944254019\" class=\"local\">'Dementia'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique should be guided by the requirements of the surgical procedure, coexisting disease(s), need to prevent postoperative complications, and patient preferences. Perioperative neuraxial anesthesia may reduce the incidence of pulmonary or cardiovascular complications in some older patients (eg, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or ischemic heart disease) during major orthopedic surgery or procedures requiring large thoracic or abdominal incisions, presumably by providing preemptive analgesia and sympatholytic effects. (See <a href=\"#H183400944\" class=\"local\">'Regional versus general anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate pain relief is associated with increased incidence of delirium and other morbidity in older patients. We suggest a multimodal approach to pain management to reduce the risk of opioid-related side effects. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is a reasonable approach when clinically indicated. For those unable to use a PCA due to cognitive dysfunction, regularly scheduled, age-adjusted doses of intravenous or subcutaneous analgesics are a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H183401017\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative mortality in older patients depends not only upon chronological age, but upon the presence and severity of coexisting disease, the urgency of the need for surgery, and the invasiveness of the procedure. However, the highest mortality rates occur in patients over age 80 after both inpatient and outpatient procedures. A prior diagnosis of heart failure confers a particularly high risk for mortality, even after minor outpatient procedures. (See <a href=\"#H183401031\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative morbidity is more common in older adults compared with younger patients, including cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and central nervous system complications (eg, stroke, delirium, postoperative cognitive dysfunction [POCD]), as well as hospital readmission and slow functional recovery.
