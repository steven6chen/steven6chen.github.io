Accurate and reliable determination of LV systolic function is important given the key role this plays in clinical practice. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371251782\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS/CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for evaluation of left ventricular (LV) systolic function include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of heart disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs or symptoms suggestive of heart disease such as unexplained electrocardiographic abnormality, palpitations, stroke, or peripheral embolic event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs or symptoms of heart failure. Information on LV systolic function as well as diastolic function, chamber geometry, regional wall motion, and valve function is important for diagnosis and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among patients with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is used to identify categories of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; LVEF &ge;50 percent), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF &le;40 percent), and heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF; LVEF 41 to 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These categories are important for diagnosis and management of heart failure. Thus, documentation of LV systolic function, including evaluation of LV ejection fraction, is considered a quality-of-care performance measure in heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Assessment of regional and global LV systolic function is commonly combined with stress testing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The presence of ventricular arrhythmias is a common indication for evaluation of LV function and structure as part of an evaluation to determine whether there is a structural cause for the arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H10017877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Additional diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planned or prior exposure to potentially cardiotoxic therapy. Patients undergoing treatment with potentially cardiotoxic therapy require serial evaluation of LV systolic function for early detection of cardiotoxicity, which may affect continued treatment.

As an example, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is performed in patients with suspected or increased risk of LV dysfunction prior to renal transplantation. However, a TTE is not generally indicated prior to noncardiac surgery unless there is a specific indication such as a symptom or sign of heart failure or valve dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient#H119947167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Resting echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4026883134\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF TEST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of imaging modality for assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function depends on a number of factors, including test indication, patient-specific factors, and facility-related factors such as availability of expertise and technology for performance of various types of testing. When the primary indication for imaging is assessment of LV systolic function, tests that do not entail radiation or potentially nephrotoxic contrast agents (such as echocardiography [with or without ultrasound contrast] and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [without gadolinium contrast]) are generally preferred, particularly for serial imaging. </p><p>Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most commonly preferred initial imaging modality, while other imaging modalities are less commonly used as the initial test to assess LV systolic function but may be helpful in specific circumstances. </p><p>Unstable patients who require urgent evaluation of LV systolic function require rapid testing, ideally at the bedside and usually by TTE. The urgency of other evaluations, such as assessment of possible acute coronary syndrome, should also be considered. </p><p>If additional information is needed, such as identification of structural heart disease (eg, infarction, cardiomyopathy, or congenital heart disease), myocardial ischemia, viability, or fibrosis, then choosing a test that enables comprehensive evaluation including this additional information is ideal from the standpoint of efficiency, patient convenience, and cost. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who require serial evaluations of LV systolic function (eg, patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy) should undergo a noninvasive, minimal risk test that has high reproducibility and sensitivity since small changes in measurement may affect management. When serial testing is anticipated, use of a consistent imaging modality (ideally at a single institution) is preferred since studies have shown that measurement of LV ejection fraction by different modalities are not interchangeable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Volumetric (3D) methods may also be preferred for serial evaluation and detection of small changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTE is the most commonly preferred initial imaging modality due to widespread availability, portability, and negligible risk. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following imaging modalities are less commonly used as the initial imaging modality for LV systolic function, but may be helpful in specific circumstances when echocardiography is nondiagnostic (eg, suboptimal image quality or results that conflict with other clinical information) or when specific information from another test is needed:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is considered more accurate and reproducible compared with two-dimensional (2D) TEE and unlike computed tomography (CT) does not entail ionizing radiation. CMR also provides additional information on cardiac structures (including pericardium, myocardium, and valves), myocardial perfusion, viability, and fibrosis that can be useful in certain clinical scenarios such as in identifying heart failure etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and is helpful in evaluating congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, CMR is not as widely available as echocardiography and CT. (See <a href=\"#H2818064037\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) may be considered when other tests are unavailable or inadequate, but exposes the patient to 6 to 7 mSv of ionizing radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. RVG may be particularly useful in patients with significant baseline wall motion abnormalities, distorted geometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], or when TTE has poor image quality. Given its high reproducibility, it is helpful when serial evaluations are needed (eg, patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy). (See <a href=\"#H3771325069\" class=\"local\">'Radionuclide ventriculography'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiac CT enables evaluation of the coronary arteries, assessment for pulmonary embolus, and characterization of the myocardium in addition to assessment of LV function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] but exposes the patient to both ionizing radiation (approximately 8 to 18 mSv) and iodinated contrast. Diagnostic accuracy may be compromised in patients with high heart rates or irregular heart rhythms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessment of LV function is generally not the primary reason for referral for single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI), but SPECT-MPI does provide information on LV function when ordered for the assessment of myocardial ischemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].

Evaluation of LV function with left ventriculography is generally not the primary reason for cardiac catheterization, as most patients are referred for coronary angiography or to assess other structural heart disease such as valve disease or congenital heart disease. Left ventriculography is performed selectively as needed (eg, when adequate timely noninvasive imaging is not available) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2121952627\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURES OF LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H388078505\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular ejection fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most commonly reported metric in the assessment of global LV systolic function. LVEF is a measure of the percentage of blood ejected during systole in relation to the total end-diastolic volume. The stroke volume (SV) is the difference between end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volumes. LVEF is calculated by dividing the SV by the end-diastolic volume as follows:</p><p>SV = (LV end-diastolic volume) &ndash; (LV end-systolic volume)</p><p>LVEF (%) = <span class=\"nowrap\">SV/</span> (LV end-diastolic volume) x 100</p><p>A larger ventricle requires a lower EF to achieve the same SV as a smaller ventricle. </p><p>In addition to quantitative calculation of LVEF, semi-quantitative (eg, visual estimates) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and qualitative (normal, hyperdynamic, depressed) assessments of LV systolic function have also been described and used clinically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108519\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108519 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2595817258\"><span class=\"h2\">Other measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other measures of LV systolic function are less commonly used than LVEF.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractional shortening (FS) is an older, simplified, linear measure of the percentage LV systolic diameter reduction, usually performed with M-mode or 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Normal values for fractional shortening are lower than corresponding LVEF measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108520 \">table 2</a>). It is calculated using linear dimensional measurements of the LV cavity diameter at end-diastolic and end-systole as follows: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">FS = [(LV end-diastolic diameter &ndash; LV end-systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">diameter)/LV</span> end-diastolic diameter] x 100</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While calculation of FS is simple, its accuracy in quantifying LV systolic dysfunction is generally limited to settings with global (rather than segmental) LV systolic dysfunction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial contractility, another parameter of LV systolic function, can be measured by calculating rate of pressure rise with time <span class=\"nowrap\">(dP/dt)</span> with the normal range &gt;3200 <span class=\"nowrap\">Hg/s</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial velocities, strain, and strain rate are additional parameters of myocardial contractility that can be measured using various techniques. The term &quot;strain&quot; reflects deformation of a structure and refers to the fractional or percentage change in the structure&rsquo;s dimension corrected for its original dimension and is calculated as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Strain (&epsilon;) = [(instantaneous length &ndash; baseline <span class=\"nowrap\">length)/baseline</span> length]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Strain rate is the rate of this change in deformation, and is calculated as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Strain rate = <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">&epsilon;/&Delta;</span> time = <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;</span> myocardial velocity gradient <span class=\"nowrap\">/baseline</span> length</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The myocardial velocity gradient is the difference in velocities between two points of the myocardial wall. Strain and strain rate can be calculated for various myocardial loci in radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Parameters such as strain and strain rate may prove to be more sensitive, reliable, and reproducible than LVEF, though their clinical roles have not been established. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac output and index are hemodynamic parameters that are impacted by LV systolic function. Cardiac output and index are calculated from SV and heart rate as follows (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults#H939587\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults&quot;, section on 'Calculation of cardiac output'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cardiac output (CO) = SV x heart rate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cardiac index (CI) = <span class=\"nowrap\">CO/body</span> surface area</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1490596655\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography uses ultrasound waves to produce real time images of the heart. A variety of echocardiographic techniques are clinically available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), with the ultrasound probe oriented in various positions over the chest wall and upper abdomen, enables visualization of the cardiac chambers and myocardium for evaluation of left ventricular (LV) size, myocardial wall motion, and wall thickening for qualitative and quantitative assessment of LV systolic function. The use of harmonic imaging and echocardiographic contrast media have been shown to significantly improve image quality for assessment of LV systolic functional parameters, particularly in patients with poor acoustic windows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].

TTE is often used in the initial and follow-up assessment of ventricular function following acute coronary syndromes. Given its availability and portability, TTE is ideal for the assessment of patients with hypotension or hemodynamic instability of uncertain or suspected cardiac etiology, allowing for real time imaging at the bedside [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H822707873\"><span class=\"h2\">Function parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Global LV systolic function can be evaluated by qualitative visual assessment, estimated semi-quantitative visual grading, or quantitatively. Qualitative visual assessment of LV systolic function is commonly reported as normal, hyperdynamic, or depressed. Depressed LV function is often further characterized by the degree of dysfunction and whether the dysfunction is global or regional. There has been some variation among LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ranges used to define the degree of LV systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) 2015 update on chamber quantification included the following LVEF percentage ranges: mildly depressed (41 to 51 for men and 41 to 53 for women), moderately depressed (30 to 40), and severely depressed (&lt;30). Visual estimation of LVEF represents one of the most common methods used in clinical practice for assessment of LV systolic function, and is typically reported in intervals of 5 or 10 percent, often with a range of values (eg, 35 to 40 percent). </p><p>Several methods have been proposed for the quantitative assessment of LVEF. The biplane method of discs (modified Simpson method) using area tracings of the LV cavity is the preferred 2D method for LV volume quantification and measurement of EF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108377 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In comparison with earlier linear methods, the modified Simpson method corrects for shape distortions with fewer geometrical assumptions. 3D echocardiographic imaging is available in some centers as an accurate method for evaluation of LV systolic function without geometric assumptions needed for 2D methods. However, adequate acoustic windows are required for 3D echocardiographic image acquisition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=three-dimensional-echocardiography#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Three-dimensional echocardiography&quot;, section on 'Assessment of left ventricular volume and function'</a>.)</p><p>Myocardial contractility, a measure of LV systolic function, can be described by measuring <span class=\"nowrap\">dP/dt,</span> or rate of pressure rise in the LV during systole using the continuous wave Doppler spectrum of the mitral regurgitation jet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Newer echocardiographic techniques using tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking echocardiography can directly obtain information on myocardial contractility, including myocardial velocities, strain, and strain rate. These methods allow for assessment of the various components of contraction, including radial, longitudinal, and circumferential contraction, allowing for assessment of global and regional systolic function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F108378\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108378 \">image 2</a>). Parameters such as global longitudinal strain may prove to be more sensitive for detection of decreased LV function than traditional measures of LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and have been recommended as an alternative clinical technique that offers incremental prognostic information over LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tissue-doppler-echocardiography#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tissue Doppler echocardiography&quot;, section on 'Strain and strain rate imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Regional evaluation of LV function is commonly determined based on qualitative visual assessment of wall thickening and endocardial motion of each myocardial segment visualized in multiple views. Seventeen- or 16-segment models of the heart are recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64968 \">figure 1</a>), with the ASE guidelines recommending the 16-segment model for routine assessment of wall motion due to limited endocardial excursion and thickening at the tip of the apex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. ASE guidelines also recommend use of a semiquantitative wall motion score (1-normal or hyperkinetic, 2-hypokinetic [reduced thickening], 3-akinetic [absent or negligible thickening], and 4-dyskinetic [systolic thinning or stretching]) assigned to each segment for calculation of LV wall motion score index as the average of scores of all visualized segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Accurate measurement of these parameters is largely dependent on the measurement of the LV outflow tract diameter (which assumes a circular LV outflow tract), although serial evaluations by comparing LV outflow tract velocity time integral are not as dependent and thus may allow for detection of subtle changes in these parameters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3518107743\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of LV volume by 2D TTE has been shown to be a very accurate technique in experimental studies using balloons and heart models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], including asymmetric heart models, with average mean difference of approximately 10 mL compared with the true volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Advantages of TTE include its noninvasive nature, ready availability, low cost, and portability, which makes it especially useful for assessment at bedside in unstable patients. Additionally, TTE offers real time imaging assessment and can be easily repeated without incurring additional risks to the patient, making it good for use in serial follow-up studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H915748163\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations and trouble shooting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>2D TTE is highly operator dependent and requires adequate acoustic windows. Obese patients, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and patients with limited space between the ribs will often have poor imaging quality. Studies have shown that quantitative assessment of LV function by 2D TTE is suboptimal (endocardium not well visualized in all 16 segments) in up to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The use of echo endocardial border definition contrast has been shown to improve the determination of LVEF in some of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Measurements are less accurate in patients with regional systolic dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> altered LV geometry, since measurements taken in one location may not be representative of the other regions. In addition, imaging planes that are off axis or foreshortened due to limited acoustic windows from the chest wall may lead to incorrect measurements entirely. In these cases, visual estimation of LVEF may be better than quantitative methods. </p><p>The other significant limitation of 2D TTE is the limited accuracy of LVEF quantitation in the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> altered LV geometry given the geometric assumptions required for LVEF calculation. 3D TTE improves the accuracy of quantitative LV function parameters compared with 2D TTE, but has even greater reliance on adequate acoustic windows and sometimes inadequate temporal resolution leading to error. Semi-automated software programs are often used for quantification, but rely on accurate placement of fiduciary points or endocardial border definition by the software or operator. With 3D TTE, image data are usually acquired over several heart beats, and artifacts are notable in patients who have ectopic beats or who cannot sustain a breath hold during image acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].

Planar images are usually obtained in three standard cardiac views (anterior, left anterior oblique, and septal) that are reviewed and analyzed to provide quantitative measurements of ventricular volumes (both right and left) and EF.

Poor labeling of the red blood cells can lead to poor count rates in the blood pool, which may lead to difficulty identifying the border between cavity and myocardium due to low target to background ratio of tracer counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Variability in the heart position and rotation in the standard views may lead to misinterpretation of the images. For example, patients with severe obstructive airway disease, pulmonary hypertension, or congenital heart disease may have significant variability in heart position, and if not corrected at the time of image acquisition, this may lead to misinterpretation of the ventricular function and segmental function due to chamber overlap or misidentification of segments or both. In some cases, the chamber overlap may be so severe that the LV cannot be assessed at all.</p><p>Attenuation artifact (shadowing by overlying structures) from breast or other chest wall tissue may affect overall image quality and thus impair image interpretation.

LVEF can be estimated by visual assessment, but more commonly is calculated using manual, semi-automated, or automated methods. The summation of discs method using the short-axis cine images of the LV is the most commonly employed method in which LV endocardial borders are traced on each short axis image at end-diastole and end-systole to determine LV cavity area, which is then multiplied by the slice interval to determine a volume for each slice.

CMR typically requires multiple breath-holds, though free breathing protocols and real time acquisitions are available (albeit with lower temporal and spatial resolution). Claustrophobic patients may be unable to undergo the examination unless they receive antianxiety medications in preparation for the test. Examination times are significantly longer compared with cardiac CT, although new techniques enable shorter examination times compared with standard protocols without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. In addition, patients are isolated from direct care when they are in the scanner and many medical devices including life support equipment cannot safely enter the scanner room, so this test is generally unsuitable for unstable patients.

Image quality may be limited in patients who are unable to hold their breath. If the level of breath holding is inconsistent, image acquisition may occur at different levels of the heart with some segments getting missed and others getting imaged twice, which may lead to variability in the calculated volumes and LVEF. Imaging is often performed at end expiration to minimize these differences. Since imaging data are usually acquired over multiple cardiac cycles with electrocardiographic gating, arrhythmias and ectopic beats may degrade image quality. Real-time methods are an alternative in patients with arrhythmias though spatial resolution is reduced. Variation in data analysis such as the methods of identifying the border between the myocardium and cavity (including how the papillary muscles and trabeculae are traced) and of selecting image slices for inclusion may affect quantitative results and lead to variability among different readers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037400248\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications related to non-contrast CMR are relatively rare, and primarily related to the strong magnetic field and its potential impact on magnetizable materials and electronic devices.

The LV cavity borders are identified using automated, semi-automated, or manual contouring of the endocardial border, with generation of time-volume curves over the entire cardiac cycle. End-diastolic and end-systolic LV cavity volumes are measured for calculation of LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/27,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,86</a>].</p><p>Regional evaluation of LV systolic function relies on visual assessment of the LV for presence of regional wall motion abnormalities using a six-point system (0 = normal, 1 = mild hypokinesis, 2 = moderate hypokinesis, 3 = severe hypokinesis, 4 = akinesis, and 5 = dyskinesis). Wall motion analysis is performed by visualizing the endocardial edge of the LV, and many commercially available programs allow readers to utilize a 3D representation of the function data.

Finally, iodinated contrast enhancement in needed for distinguishing the muscle from the cavity, and poor contrast enhancement of the cavity from inadequate intravenous access, poor timing of contrast injection and scanning, or obesity may lead to inaccurate distinction of the endocardial cavity interface, particularly with automated methods and inaccurate quantification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2384136780\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac CT angiography exposes the patient to radiation associated with the acquisition of the scan, although lower radiation dose protocols have been proposed that limit radiation exposure to less than 5 mSv [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Additionally, cardiac CT angiography exposes the patient to intravenous administration of iodinated contrast. The total volume of iodinated contrast administered is usually based on the injection rate and scan duration, and typically is 50 to 120 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. The risks specific to iodinated contrast induce allergic and non-idiosyncratic reactions. Non-idiosyncratic reactions reflect the physiologic effects of contrast media and direct organ toxicity, such as contrast-induced nephropathy, which is estimated to occur in 2 to 7 percent of all patients undergoing CT scans with contrast. Iodinated contrast agents cross the placenta, although clinical sequelae from brief exposures have not been reported. Breastfeeding is considered reasonable, as less than 1 percent of the contrast dose is excreted into breast milk and only 1 percent of the amount ingested actually absorbed from the infant&rsquo;s gastrointestinal tract, but mothers should be informed of the theoretical risks of toxicity or allergic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/141,142\" class=\"abstract_t\">141,142</a>].

Quantitative assessment of ventricular volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and regional contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>] are often performed using single <span class=\"nowrap\">plane/projection</span> (30 degree right anterior oblique) imaging, although biplane techniques (30 degree right anterior oblique and 60 degree left anterior oblique) are considered more accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">144,145</a>].

Both single and biplane methods are used, with biplane requiring double the radiation dose (and double the contrast if not performed with biplane system). Given this, the risks and benefits must be weighed for individual patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2009871222\"><span class=\"h2\">Function parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Qualitative and semiquantitative methods are available for assessment of LVEF using rapid, automated digital methods. LV systolic function can be graded qualitatively using visual assessment of cine image loops. LVEF can be determined by visual assessment of cine image loops or quantitatively using geometric models for calculation of LV volumes in end-systole and end-diastole. Automated, semi-automated, or manual tracing of endocardial borders using post-processing software is performed at end-diastole and end-systole, and LV volumes are calculated using an appropriate geometric reference figure such as the prolate ellipsoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. LVEF is calculated based on the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes using the LVEF formula. Regional function is commonly evaluated using visual assessment of wall motion for each segment using cine loops of each imaging plane. Concomitant hemodynamic LV measurements of LV pressure can be obtained for assessment of circumferential stress, generation of pressure volume curves, and assessment of LV compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3439398302\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive LVG has been demonstrated in multiple studies to significantly overestimate LV volumes and LVEF compared with noninvasive techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/37,38,146\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,146</a>], with up to 20 percent difference in agreement for LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The use of biplane LVG has not been shown to consistently provide incremental information compared with single plane LVG, although biplane LVG measurements correlate better with cardiovascular magnetic resonance for LVEF, ventricular volumes, and wall motion than single plane LVG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Visual estimation of LVEF by LVG correlates variably to EF from transthoracic echocardiography, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/147-149\" class=\"abstract_t\">147-149</a>]. Invasive LVG demonstrates high agreement between readers for LV systolic function with limits of agreement of 11 percent for LVEF and &plusmn;18 to 21 mL for LV volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Interobserver variability for assessment of regional LV function demonstrates very high interrater agreement with cardiac CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2205364665\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive LVG has long been considered the gold standard for evaluation of LV systolic function but it has now largely been supplanted by noninvasive methods. When performed in the setting of a cardiac catheterization procedure, it adds only a few additional minutes with low cost compared with performing an additional noninvasive study. Although limited, concomitant assessment of mitral valve regurgitation and other structures (eg, interventricular shunting) can be obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1239129773\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations and trouble shooting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive LVG is an invasive procedure requiring arterial access, radiation exposure and iodinated contrast. Average radiation exposure for coronary angiography plus LVG is approximately 5 to 7 mSv [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/150,151\" class=\"abstract_t\">150,151</a>]. The typical volume of iodinated contrast is 35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/view</span>. Two injections are needed for biplane methods if a biplane system is not available.</p><p>Invasive LVG is commonly performed in one or two imaging planes, which are used for assessment of LV volume, LVEF, and regional wall motion. Assumptions using geometric models and correction for radiographic magnification are needed for quantification of LV volumes and LVEF. The different ventricular shapes that occur with disease states can make these assumptions invalid. LVG can only assess a single valvular abnormality (mitral regurgitation) and a single cardiac chamber, unlike other techniques that allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of cardiac structure and function. There can be a high rate of nondiagnostic or suboptimal diagnostic image quality related to a variety factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. </p><p>Proper performance of LVG is important to generate high-quality data. Power injections, as opposed to hand injections, are required for adequate opacification of the LV cavity. Multi-sidehole catheters are the safest and most effective as compared with single end-hole catheters. The contrast volume should be sufficient (usually 35 to 40 mL) to completely opacify the ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>] with imaging in appropriate angulated views to best visualize the LV and allow for accurate quantification of LV volumes and EF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Common problems include improper measurement of LVEF during a postextrasystolic contraction, catheter-induced mitral regurgitation, and incomplete LV opacification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040323915\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, complications can occur with invasive LVG. The 35 to 40 mL injection of iodinated contrast required for LVG increases the total amount of contrast used for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Complications include hypersensitivity reactions to contrast agent. Patients with chronic kidney disease, hypotension, anemia, and heart failure are at increased risk for developing contrast-induced nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. Patients with elevated end-diastolic pressure may be at increased risk of acute respiratory decompensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Embolization of air, thrombus, or the catheter tip may occur due to technically errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/156,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">156,157</a>]. Patients with LV mural thrombus or aortic valve vegetations are also at risk of systemic embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Mechanical stimulation of the ventricular endocardium by the catheter or injection jet can lead to ventricular extra-systoles and ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation are very rare complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/8,158-160\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,158-160</a>]. Different degrees of heart block may also occur due to the proximity of the left bundle to the LV outflow tract. Very rarely, myocardial and pericardial staining, myocardial rupture, and pericardial tamponade have been described related to improper catheter positioning or use of end-hole catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function/abstract/161,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,162</a>].
