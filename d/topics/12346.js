Bilateral dysplasia is likely to be diagnosed earlier than unilateral dysplasia especially if oligohydramnios is present. Renal ultrasound features include increased echogenicity as a result of abnormal renal parenchymal tissue, poor corticomedullary differentiation, and parenchymal cysts.</p><p>Infants with bilateral dysplasia may have impaired renal function at birth, and subsequent progressive renal failure may occur. Associated urological findings include abnormalities of the renal pelvis, calyces (eg, congenital hydronephrosis), and ureters (eg, duplicating collecting system megaureter, ureteral stenosis, and vesicoureteral reflux [VUR]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

If there is an associated urological abnormality such as VUR in the normal contralateral kidney, children with unilateral renal dysplasia may be at increased risk of long-term sequelae of renal scarring from recurrent UTI.

For example, multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Multicystic dysplasia'</a> below) typically has no viable functional renal tissue and, therefore, no detectable renal blood flow or renal function. However, there may be rare variations of segmental dysplasia. Thus, these imaging studies may be useful in defining baseline renal function and risk of future renal damage.</p><p>A more detailed description of the postnatal evaluation in infants with CAKUT is discussed separately.

In these patients, ongoing monitoring of the patient is recommended with yearly assessment of blood pressure and urinalysis. In patients with elevated blood pressure or urinary protein excretion, renal function should be assessed by obtaining a serum creatinine to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
