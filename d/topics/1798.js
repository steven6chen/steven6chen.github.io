Elam and Safar described the technique and benefits of mouth-to-mouth ventilation in 1958 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Kouwenhoven, Knickerbocker, and Jude subsequently described the benefits of external chest compressions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], which in combination with mouth-to-mouth ventilation form the basis of modern CPR. External defibrillation, first described in 1957 by Kouwenhoven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], has since been incorporated into resuscitation guidelines.</p><p>Basic life support consists of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and, when available, defibrillation using automated external defibrillators (AED). The keys to survival from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) are early recognition and treatment, specifically, immediate initiation of excellent CPR and early defibrillation.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the critical facets of basic life support in adults for clinicians as presented in the American Heart Association and European Resuscitation Council's 2010 Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care, and the update of these guidelines published in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) and other related topics, such as airway management and basic life support for infants and children, are presented separately.

In North America and Europe, the estimated incidence falls between 50 to 100 per 100,000 in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most common etiology of SCA is ischemic cardiovascular disease resulting in the development of lethal arrhythmias. Resuscitation is attempted in up to two-thirds of people who sustain SCA.</p><p>Despite the development of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), electrical defibrillation, and other advanced resuscitative techniques over the past 50 years, survival rates for SCA remain low. The epidemiology and etiology of SCA are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessments of survival from SCA have reached widely disparate conclusions. In the out-of-hospital setting, studies have reported survival rates of 1 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Three systematic reviews of survival-to-hospital discharge from out-of-hospital SCA reported 5 to 10 percent survival among those treated by emergency medical services (EMS) and 15 percent survival when the underlying rhythm disturbance was ventricular fibrillation (VF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. An analysis of a national registry of in-hospital SCA reported a 17 percent survival to discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>While early, properly performed CPR improves outcomes, not performing CPR or low quality performance are important factors contributing to poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. Multiple studies assessing both in-hospital and prehospital performance of CPR have shown that trained health care providers consistently fail to meet basic life support guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESUSCITATION GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Heart Association (AHA) 2010 Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (AHA Guidelines) are based upon an extensive review of the clinical and laboratory evidence performed by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].

The emphasis of treatment varies according to the phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3856972\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrical phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrical phase is defined as the first 4 to 5 minutes of arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Immediate DC cardioversion is needed to optimize survival of these patients. Performing excellent chest compressions while the defibrillator is readied also improves survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3856979\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemodynamic phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemodynamic or circulatory phase, which follows the electrical phase, consists of the period from 4 to 10 minutes after SCA, during which the patient may remain in VF. Early defibrillation remains critical for survival in patients found in VF. Excellent chest compressions should be started immediately upon recognizing SCA and continued until just before defibrillation is performed (ie, charge the defibrillator during active compressions, stopping only briefly to confirm the rhythm and deliver the shock). Resume CPR immediately after the shock is delivered. </p><p>It remains unclear whether it is beneficial during the hemodynamic phase to delay defibrillation in order to perform 2 to 3 minutes of CPR. Randomized trials have reached inconsistent conclusions: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, investigators randomly assigned 200 patients with out-of-hospital VF arrest to receive immediate defibrillation or 3 minutes of CPR prior to defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among cases with ambulance response times over 5 minutes, patients treated with CPR prior to defibrillation had higher rates of survival to hospital discharge than those immediately defibrillated (22 versus 4 percent, odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% CI 1.6-34.3). In contrast, among cases with a rapid ambulance response, patient outcomes did not differ.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar trial of 202 patients found no statistically significant increase in survival to hospital discharge with 3 minutes of CPR prior to defibrillation, regardless of ambulance response time (17 versus 10 percent, p = 0.16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third trial treated 256 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using immediate defibrillation or 90 seconds (rather than 3 minutes) of CPR followed immediately by defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge (4.2 versus 5.1 percent, odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.25-2.6). Although subgroup analysis was not planned for this study, no differences in survival were noted in the two treatment groups based upon ambulance response time.</p><p/><p>The AHA Guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether a period of CPR prior to defibrillation is beneficial in all cases of SCA. A meta-analysis of the randomized trials described above concluded that either approach is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], while another meta-analysis with more liberal inclusion criteria emphasized the conflicting nature of the evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>While it is essential to provide excellent CPR until the defibrillator is attached to the patient and charged and to resume doing so immediately after the shock is delivered, we believe there is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify delaying defibrillation in order to perform chest compressions for any predetermined period. For EMS systems that do advocate this approach, clinicians should consider both patient downtime and their own response time when deciding whether to postpone defibrillation to provide CPR. As an example, it would be reasonable to perform 2 minutes of excellent CPR prior to defibrillation for patients with an unwitnessed cardiac arrest and fine ventricular fibrillation whose down time is thought to exceed 3 to 5 minutes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3856986\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of the metabolic phase, defined as greater than 10 minutes of pulselessness, is primarily based upon postresuscitative measures, including hypothermia therapy. If not quickly converted into a perfusing rhythm, patients in this phase generally do not survive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2399946\"><span class=\"h2\">Recognition of cardiac arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid recognition of cardiac arrest is the essential first step of successful resuscitation. According to the AHA Guidelines, the rescuer who witnesses a person collapse or comes across an apparently unresponsive person should check to be sure the area is safe before approaching the victim and then confirm unresponsiveness by tapping the person on the shoulder and shouting: &quot;are you all right?&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. If the person does not respond, the rescuer calls for help, activates the emergency response system, and initiates excellent chest compressions. The 2015 guidelines emphasize the use of mobile telephones as a means of system activation. Many emergency dispatch centers have adopted protocols for dispatchers to contemporaneously instruct untrained lay rescuers to perform CO-CPR in order to enhance survival.</p><p>The AHA Guidelines emphasize that even well-trained professionals can have difficulty determining if pulses are present or breathing is adequate in unresponsive patients. Lay rescuers should <strong>not</strong> attempt to assess the victim's pulse and, unless the patient has what appear to be normal respirations, should assume the patient is apneic. A knowledgeable clinician may check for a carotid pulse; however, no more than 10 seconds should be spent assessing pulselessness. The same criteria for establishing apnea is used by both lay rescuers and health care providers, and should be performed in parallel with the pulse check. If the unresponsive patient is not breathing normally, consider the patient apneic. The key principle is not to delay the initiation of CPR in patients who require it.

While doing so, it is reasonable for the health care provider to visually assess the patient's respirations. It is appropriate to assume the patient is in cardiac arrest if there is absent or abnormal breathing (eg, gasping) or if a pulse cannot be readily palpated within 10 seconds. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest compressions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Performance of excellent chest compressions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest compressions are the most important element of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Coronary perfusion pressure and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are maximized when excellent chest compressions are performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The mantra of the AHA BLS Guidelines was: &quot;push hard and push fast on the center of the chest&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55548\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55548 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although this is easy to learn and remember, the revised guidelines have added upper limits to what is considered &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;fast&rdquo; when performing chest compressions.

This may require movement of the patient or bed, adjustment of the bed's height, or the use of a step-stool so the rescuer performing chest compressions is appropriately positioned. The patient must lie on a firm surface. This may require a backboard if chest compressions are performed on a bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. If a backboard cannot be used, the patient should be placed on the floor. All efforts to deliver excellent CPR must take precedence over any advanced procedures, such as tracheal intubation.</p><p>The rescuer places the heel of one hand in the center of the chest over the lower (caudad) portion of the sternum and the heel of their other hand atop the first. The rescuer's own chest should be directly above their hands. This enables the rescuer to use their body weight to compress the patient's chest, rather than just the muscles of their arms, which may fatigue quickly. </p><p>It is imperative that each facet of performing excellent chest compressions be continually reassessed and corrections made throughout the resuscitation. Resuscitation teams may believe that compressions are being performed appropriately when in fact they are inadequate and cerebral perfusion is compromised, thereby reducing the chance for neurologically intact survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>An inadequate rate of chest compression reduces the likelihood of ROSC and neurologically intact survival following sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/36,38,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38,43,44</a>]. Rates as high as 125 compressions per minute have been beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The AHA Guidelines recommend a rate of <strong>at least</strong> 100 compressions per minute but not more than 120. Audiovisual tools that provide immediate feedback may help rescuers maintain adequate rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>Animal and observational clinical studies suggest that chest compressions of proper depth (at least 5 cm) play an important role in successful resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. In addition, full chest recoil between down-strokes promotes reduced intrathoracic pressures, resulting in enhanced cardiac preload and higher coronary perfusion pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. According to the AHA Guidelines, rescuers are better at allowing full recoil when they receive immediate automated feedback on CPR performance and if they remove their hands slightly but completely from the chest wall at the end of each compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Inadequate compression and incomplete recoil are more common when rescuers fatigue, which can begin as soon as 1 minute after beginning CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The AHA Guidelines suggest that the rescuer performing chest compressions be changed every 2 minutes whenever more than one rescuer is present. Interruptions in chest compressions are reduced by changing the rescuer performing compressions at the 2-minute interval when the rhythm is assessed, and the patient is defibrillated if needed. However, if the rescuer is unable to perform adequate compressions, immediately switching to a capable rescuer is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2399446\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimizing interruptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interruptions in chest compressions during CPR, no matter how brief, result in unacceptable declines in coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure and worse patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/34,43,50-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,43,50-56</a>]. Once compressions stop, up to 1 minute of continuous, excellent compressions may be required to achieve sufficient perfusion pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Two minutes of continuous CPR should be performed following any interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The coordination of chest compressions and ventilation during CPR is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ventilations'</a> below.) </p><p>Rescuers must ensure that excellent chest compressions are provided with minimal interruption; pulse checks and rhythm analysis without compressions should only be performed at preplanned intervals (every 2 minutes). Such interruptions should not exceed 10 seconds, except for specific interventions, such as defibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pulse checks and rhythm analysis'</a> below.)</p><p>When preparing for defibrillation, rescuers should continue performing excellent chest compressions while charging the defibrillator until just before the single shock is delivered, and resume immediately after shock delivery without taking time to assess pulse or breathing. No more than three to five seconds should elapse between stopping chest compressions and shock delivery. If a single lay rescuer is providing CPR, excellent chest compressions should be performed continuously without ventilations. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Compression-only CPR (CO-CPR)'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiple studies of trained rescuers support the importance of uninterrupted chest compressions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One prospective study reported improved survival among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with minimally interrupted cardiac resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This study was performed as urban and rural EMS and Fire personnel in Arizona were being trained in the approach advocated by the AHA 2005 BLS Guidelines, which were the first to emphasize continuous chest compressions with minimal interruption. Survival among patients rescued by personnel trained according to the 2005 Guidelines was 5.4 percent (36 out of 668) compared to 1.8 percent (4 out of 218) among those treated according to earlier BLS guidelines (odds ratio [OR] 3.0; 95% CI 1.1-8.9). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective observational study compared survival rates and neurologic outcomes in two groups of rural patients who sustained out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The first group was treated between 2001 and 2003 according to the 2000 AHA Guidelines (standard compressions and ventilations), while the second group was treated between 2004 and 2007 according to the 2005 AHA Guidelines (compression-only CPR without ventilations). Among 92 patients in the first group, 18 survived of whom 14 (15 percent) were neurologically intact. Of the 89 patients in the second group, 42 survived of whom 35 (39 percent) were neurologically intact.

In a cluster-randomized trial involving 114 emergency medical service (EMS) agencies, 1129 of 12,613 patients (9.0 percent) treated with continuous chest compressions survived to hospital discharge, compared to 1072 of 11,035 patients (9.7 percent) treated with standard CPR, consisting of cycles of 30 chest compressions interrupted briefly to provide 2 ventilations (difference 0.7 percent; 95% CI -1.5 to 0.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Neurologic outcome among survivors also did not differ significantly between groups. As noted in the accompanying editorial, the mean chest compression fraction (percentage of each minute during resuscitation when compressions were being performed) was quite high in both groups, and thus essentially neither group experienced major interruptions in CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

The Guidelines further state that lay rescuers should <strong>not</strong> interrupt excellent chest compressions to palpate for pulses or check for the return of spontaneous circulation, and should continue CPR until an AED is ready to defibrillate, EMS personnel assume care, or the patient wakes up. Note that CO-CPR is <strong>not</strong> recommended for children or arrest of noncardiac origin (eg, near drowning).

This reluctance may stem from anxiety about performing CPR correctly or fear of contracting a communicable disease, despite scant reports of infection contracted from the performance of mouth-to-mouth ventilation, none of which involve HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Randomized trials of bystander CPR that have compared CO-CPR to conventional CPR with a 15:2 ratio have shown that CO-CPR increases survival to hospital discharge, but evidence is lacking to show favorable neurologic outcomes with good quality of life following bystander CO-CPR.

Consequently, the initiation of excellent chest compressions is the first step to improving oxygen delivery to the tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55548\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55548 \">algorithm 1</a>). This is the rationale behind the compressions-airway-breathing (C-A-B) approach to SCA advocated in the AHA Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, in patients whose cardiac arrest is associated with hypoxia, it is likely that oxygen reserves have already been depleted, necessitating the performance of excellent standard CPR with ventilations. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chest compressions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Compression-only CPR (CO-CPR)'</a> above.)</p><p>Properly performed ventilations become increasingly important as pulselessness persists. In this, the metabolic phase of resuscitation, clinicians must continue to ensure that ventilations do not interfere with the cadence and continuity of chest compressions. The techniques used in basic airway management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Phases of resuscitation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Proper ventilation for adults includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give two ventilations after every 30 compressions for patients without an advanced airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give each ventilation over no more than one second</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide only enough tidal volume to see the chest rise (approximately 500 to 600 mL, or 6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid excessive ventilation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give one asynchronous ventilation every 8 to 10 seconds (6 to 8 per minute) to patients with an advanced airway (eg, supraglottic device, endotracheal tube) in place</p><p/><p>Although the Guidelines recommend 10 breaths per minute, we believe 6 to 8 breaths are adequate in the low-flow state during cardiac resuscitation of adults. However, the key point is to avoid excessive ventilation.</p><p>Asynchronous implies ventilations need not be coordinated with chest compressions. Ventilations should be delivered in as short a period as possible, not exceeding one second per breath, while avoiding excessive ventilatory force. Only enough tidal volume to confirm initial chest rise should be given. This approach promotes both prompt resumption of compressions and improved cerebral and coronary perfusion.</p><p>Excessive ventilation, whether by high-ventilatory rates or increased volumes, must be avoided. Positive pressure ventilation raises intrathoracic pressure which causes a decrease in venous return, pulmonary perfusion, cardiac output, and cerebral and coronary perfusion pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Studies in animal models have found that over-ventilation reduces defibrillation success rates and decreases overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/34,58,70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,58,70-72</a>]. </p><p>Despite the risk of compromised perfusion, rescuers routinely over-ventilate patients. One study of prehospital resuscitation reported that average ventilation rates during CPR were 30 per minute, while a study of in-hospital CPR revealed ventilation rates of more than 20 per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/23,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,69</a>]. It is imperative that the rate and volume of ventilations be continually reassessed and corrections made throughout the resuscitation. Resuscitation teams often believe that ventilations are being performed effectively when in fact they are not (usually due to poor bag-mask-ventilation technique), resulting in inadequate cerebral perfusion and reducing the patient's chance for a neurologically intact survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Defibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of early defibrillation in patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) and short &quot;downtimes&quot; is well supported by the resuscitation literature and early defibrillation is a fundamental recommendation of the AHA BLS Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/26,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,73</a>]. As soon as a defibrillator is available, providers should assess the cardiac rhythm and, when indicated, perform defibrillation as quickly as possible. With the exception of excellent CPR, no intervention (eg, intubation, placement of intravenous catheter, administration of medication) is performed before rhythm assessment and defibrillation. For BLS, a single shock from an automated external defibrillator (AED) is followed <strong>immediately</strong> by the resumption of excellent chest compressions. For advanced cardiac life support, a single shock is recommended regardless of whether a biphasic or monophasic defibrillator is used. </p><p>Biphasic defibrillators are preferred because of the lower energy levels needed for effective cardioversion. Biphasic defibrillators measure the impedance between the electrodes placed on the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F103268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103268 \">figure 1</a>) and adjust the energy delivered accordingly. Rates of first shock success are reported to be approximately 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>].

We recommend that all defibrillations for patients in cardiac arrest be delivered at the highest available energy in adults (generally 360 J for a monophasic defibrillator and 200 J for a biphasic defibrillator). This approach reduces interruptions in CPR and is implicitly supported by a study in which out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients randomly assigned to treatment with escalating energy using a biphasic device showed higher conversion and termination rates for ventricular fibrillation than those assigned to treatment with fixed lower energy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

This issue is discussed elsewhere.

Therefore, cardiac rhythm analysis should only be performed during a planned interruption at the 2 minute interval following a complete cycle of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Even short delays in the initiation or brief interruptions in the performance of CPR can compromise cerebral and coronary perfusion pressure and decrease survival. Following any interruption, sustained chest compressions are needed to regain pre-interruption rates of blood flow. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chest compressions'</a> above.)</p><p>Wide variation exists in the ability of both lay rescuers and health care providers to determine pulselessness accurately and efficiently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Therefore, the AHA BLS Guidelines recommend that untrained rescuers begin CPR immediately, without a pulse check, as soon as they determine a patient is unresponsive with abnormal respirations. Health care providers must not spend more than 10 seconds checking for a pulse, and should start CPR immediately if no pulse is felt. The author advocates that clinicians use end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring to determine the return of spontaneous circulation, which reduces interruptions in CPR by obviating the need for pulse checks. (See <a href=\"#H2399946\" class=\"local\">'Recognition of cardiac arrest'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;, section on 'Return of spontaneous circulation'</a>.)</p><p>The AHA Guidelines recommend that CPR be resumed for 2 minutes, without a pulse check, after any attempt at defibrillation, regardless of the resulting rhythm.

We recommend following the practices described in the AHA BLS Guidelines, the important elements of which are summarized below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chest compressions</strong> &ndash; Chest compressions are the most important element of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Interruptions in chest compressions during CPR, no matter how brief, result in unacceptable declines in coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure. The CPR mantra is: <strong>&quot;push hard and push fast </strong>(but not too hard nor too fast) <strong>on the center of the chest.&quot;</strong> The critical performance standards for CPR include (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chest compressions'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintain the rate of chest compression at 100 to 120 compressions per minute</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compress the chest at least 5 cm (2 inches) but no more than 6 cm (2.5 inches) with each down-stroke &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Allow the chest to recoil completely between each down-stroke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minimize the frequency and duration of any interruptions </p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compression-only CPR (CO-CPR)</strong> &ndash; The appropriate use of CO-CPR is as follows (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Compression-only CPR (CO-CPR)'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When multiple trained personnel are present, the simultaneous performance of continuous excellent chest compressions and proper ventilation with a 30:2 compression to ventilation ratio is recommended for the management of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a sole lay rescuer is present or multiple lay rescuers are reluctant to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, the AHA Guidelines encourage the performance of CPR using chest compressions alone. Lay rescuers should <strong>not</strong> interrupt chest compressions to palpate for pulses and should continue CPR until an automated external defibrillators (AED) is ready to defibrillate, EMS personnel assume care, or the patient wakes up. Note that CO-CPR is <strong>not</strong> recommended for children or arrest of noncardiac origin (eg, near drowning). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventilations</strong> &ndash; As pulselessness persists in patients with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), the importance of performing ventilations increases. The AHA Guidelines suggest a compression to ventilation ratio of 30:2. Each ventilation should be delivered over no more than one second. Ventilations must <strong>not</strong> be delivered with excessive force; only enough tidal volume to confirm chest rise should be given. <strong>Avoid excessive ventilation</strong> (which can compromise cardiac output) due to high rates or increased volumes. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ventilations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compression-ventilation ratio</strong> &ndash; In adults, the AHA Guidelines recommend that CPR be performed at a <strong>ratio of 30 excellent compressions to two ventilations</strong> until an advanced airway has been placed. Following placement of an advanced airway, excellent compressions are continuous, and asynchronous ventilations are delivered approximately 6 to 8 times per minute. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Ventilations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Defibrillation</strong> &ndash; Early defibrillation is critical to the survival of patients with ventricular fibrillation. The AHA Guidelines recommend a <strong>single defibrillation</strong> in all shocking sequences. In adults, we suggest defibrillation using the highest available energy (generally 200 J with a biphasic defibrillator and 360 J with a monophasic defibrillator) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Compressions should not be stopped until the defibrillator has been fully charged. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Defibrillation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Phases of resuscitation</strong> &ndash; There are three phases of sudden cardiac arrest. The electrical phase comprises the first 4 to 5 minutes and requires immediate defibrillation. The hemodynamic phase spans approximately minutes 4 to 10 following SCA. Patients in the hemodynamic phase benefit from excellent chest compressions to generate adequate cerebral and coronary perfusion and immediate defibrillation. The metabolic phase occurs following approximately 10 minutes of pulselessness; few patients who reach this phase survive. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Phases of resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Instruction</strong> &ndash; All health care providers should receive standardized training in CPR and be familiar with the operation of AED.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-life-support-bls-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">SAFAR P, ESCARRAGA LA, ELAM JO.
