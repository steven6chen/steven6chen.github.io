It is characterized by neutropenia that recurs every 14 to 35 days, although over 90 percent of patients exhibit a cycle period of 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many of the patients present in the first years of life. While the disease tends to be benign, several affected patients have died of infection, in particular from clostridial sepsis, probably related to intestinal ulceration and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Rarely, patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) can present with intermittent neutropenia that may mimic cyclic neutropenia, though the presentation may not be typical, and patients with cyclic neutropenia do not have the other dysmorphic features seen in SDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shwachman-diamond-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shwachman-Diamond syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is an acquired adult onset form of cyclic neutropenia; however, it is autoimmune rather than genetic in nature and has been found in association with T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-t-cell-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia#H458740684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclic neutropenia can be cured by hematopoietic cell transplantation in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and has been transferred from an affected human donor to a recipient following hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], demonstrating that this disorder is an intrinsic disorder of bone marrow stem cells.</p><p>The bone marrow in this disorder is usually hypocellular with an arrest in myelocyte maturation during times of neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. At the onset of the neutropenia, postmitotic cells are absent from the marrow, but earlier precursors are present. Microscopic studies during all phases of the cycle show cellular blebbing and nuclear condensation, typical of apoptosis. Flow cytometric studies have shown increased numbers of annexin-V labeled myeloid precursors, indicating selective apoptotic death, resulting in removal of neutrophil precursors. Consistent with these observations, early mathematical models of hematopoiesis had predicted that oscillations in peripheral neutrophil counts would occur if there were an increased rate of irreversible cell loss within the stem cell pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Cyclic neutropenia is attributable, in at least 95 percent of cases, to autosomal dominant mutations in the elastase gene (<em>ELANE</em>) on chromosome 19p13.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The mutations occur throughout the locus and many coincide with those found in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), indicating a role of genetic background in determining the phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unlike SCN, cyclic neutropenia is not associated with malignant transformation to acute myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclic neutropenia usually presents during the first years of life with recurring fevers and neutropenia. It can occur in a familial pattern indicative of autosomal dominant inheritance. Among families with autosomal dominant disease, there is a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from an asymptomatic state to life-threatening infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Many parents will state that the affected child does not feel well for two or three days out of the month, whether or not there is actual fever.</p><p>The hallmark of the clinical presentation is the very predictable recurrence of symptoms. The period is 14 to 35 days in various individuals but is usually consistent with each patient, most often at about 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Associated recurrent malaise, fever, pharyngitis, gingivitis, and stomatitis, with or without bacterial infections, are observed in most patients during periods of severe neutropenia, which typically last a few days to a week during each cycle. The duration of neutropenia is quite variable between patients but is consistent for an individual. The severity of the infections parallels the severity of the neutropenia and can be variable. While the disease tends to be benign, a number of patients have died of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>As with other primary neutropenia disorders, examination of the gingiva and oral mucosa is very helpful. In contrast to patients with neutropenia and normal marrow reserve pools, patients with neutropenia due to decreased production, such as cyclic neutropenia, are not able to mobilize neutrophils to sites of infection and develop chronic mouth ulcers and gingival disease. Thus, the presence of significant gingival disease suggests more significant duration of neutropenia.</p><p>Gingival inflammation, edema, and recession can occur; alveolar bone support may be lost in the preschool-age child, resulting in premature tooth mobility and loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79500\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79500 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodontal-disease-in-children-associated-systemic-conditions#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodontal disease in children: Associated systemic conditions&quot;, section on 'Cyclic neutropenia'</a>.)</p><p>The symptoms of cyclic neutropenia are not from the neutropenia itself but from the inflammatory consequences of infection due to neutropenia. As such, the symptoms, if they occur, lag behind the neutropenia, such that neutrophil counts are usually about to recover when the child starts to feel ill. Interestingly, patients may report an increased sense of well-being as their absolute neutrophil counts recover to <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;500/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>One particularly severe infection that occurs in these patients is sepsis due to Clostridial species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. In one review of children with Clostridial sepsis not due to trauma, neutropenia was due to chemotherapy in 70 percent and cyclic neutropenia in 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The presence of abdominal discomfort, pain or tenderness, especially during the neutropenic phase of the cycle, is an emergency. Several of the reported deaths in patients with cyclic neutropenia were after an acute illness with abdominal pain and were associated with Clostridia or gram negative organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridial-myonecrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridial myonecrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cyclic neutropenia is usually not associated with short stature, dysmorphic features, chronic diarrhea, or hepatosplenomegaly. These features suggest presence of some disorder other than cyclic neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia#H430729003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Shwachman-Diamond syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Childhood cyclic neutropenia can persist for many years, but tends to decrease in severity with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. Most affected children survive to adulthood; symptoms are often milder after the onset of puberty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclic neutropenia is an exceedingly rare cause of neutropenia, but the diagnosis should be entertained in the presence of the clinical picture noted above. Cyclic neutropenia must be differentiated from cyclic fevers without neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and from other causes of neutropenia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia is established by documentation of an absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL,</span> usually for at least two to three days, in each of two to three regularly spaced cycles. This typically requires monitoring of the neutrophil count two to three times per week for six to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/2,3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,15</a>]. The nadir of the neutropenia can be missed if the patient is monitored less frequently. The cycling phenomenon can occur intermittently in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], making the diagnosis more difficult. Of note, the monocyte counts cycle out of phase with the neutrophils, with significant monocytosis at the nadir of the neutrophil counts and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, presence of monocytosis can be seen in other types of congenital and acquired neutropenia. Testing for the ELANE gene mutation can be helpful and should be done in all cases where the index of suspicion is high.</p><p>Bone marrow aspiration is not helpful for making a diagnosis of having cyclic neutropenia.</p><p>DNA mutational analysis for the <em>ELANE</em> gene is positive in 90 to 100 percent of patients with cyclic neutropenia and can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. In patients where the index of suspicion is high based on the clinical history, we often obtain ELANE mutational analysis at the onset. This is much more convenient for the family and can narrow the differential quickly. However, a positive result must be distinguished from severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Severe congenital neutropenia'</a>). If the genetic analysis is negative and the index of suspicion remains high, other possibilities must be explored. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the name of the syndrome is known by most physicians and is often found at the top of the differential diagnosis whenever neutropenia is seen, the diagnosis of true cyclic neutropenia is rarely confirmed.</p><p>It is not uncommon to see patients whose neutrophil counts cycle with nadirs in the 500 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> range. These patients usually have chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">benign/autoimmune</span> neutropenia. They usually do not have any symptoms, nor do they have the signs of chronic gingival infection characteristic of patients with chronic severe neutropenia and do not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of chronic severe neutropenia or cyclic neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-neutropenia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Chronic idiopathic neutropenia'</a>.)</p><p>Cyclic episodes of fever due to cyclic neutropenia must be differentiated from the periodic fever syndromes (eg, familial Mediterranean fever, TNF receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome, hyper-IgD syndrome), disorders that are not associated with neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;, section on 'Hallmarks of the autoinflammatory diseases'</a>.)</p><p>Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, lymphoproliferative disorders of large granular lymphocytes (LDGL) and primary immunodeficiencies can also present with a cyclic pattern, and should be included in the differential of cyclic neutropenia, especially if short stature, dysmorphic features, or hepatomegaly or splenomegaly are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cyclic neutropenia often have, or will develop, severe dental, gingival, and mucosal inflammation. In general, patients with cyclic neutropenia are not at the same high risk for infection as post-chemotherapy patients, since they have active monocytosis during neutropenia and their lymphocyte-mediated immunity is not impaired. As a result, routine hospitalization for their episodes of febrile neutropenia is usually not required.</p><p>However, infectious deaths have been reported in patients with cyclic neutropenia. Accordingly, these patients should not be assumed to be normal. They should be evaluated by a physician familiar with the disorder when they have significant fever during episodes of neutropenia. The presence of abdominal pain, tenderness, or vomiting associated with neutropenia raises the possibility of neutropenic ileocolitis, which requires treatment with parenteral antibiotics to cover enteric organisms including Clostridial species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>].</p><p>We recommend treating all patients with confirmed cyclic neutropenia with recombinant G-CSF. This will reduce gingival and dental complications and reduce the risk of sepsis during periods of severe neutropenia. As the neutrophil cycling can stop and be replaced by a mild chronic neutropenia in third decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], continued use of G-CSF may not be necessary unless the patient develops chronic gingivitis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of such children with cyclic neutropenia is largely supportive and should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular and aggressive dental care is recommended. The antibacterial mouthwash Peridex is useful in decreasing gingivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/16,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone density should be monitored for development of osteoporosis during prolonged treatment with G-CSF, as osteoporosis is a possible side effect of this medication. Appropriate treatment should be provided, if this complication is present. We also recommend monitoring of 25-OH-vitamin D levels and appropriate supplementation to maintain adequate levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to patients with cyclic neutropenia leads to a 10- to 20-fold increase in the mean absolute neutrophil count (ANC), prevents infections, and is safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/14,21,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,23-26</a>].</p><p>We suggest treatment with subcutaneous G-CSF, starting at 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> every one to two days. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegfilgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pegfilgrastim</a> (a long-acting pegylated formulation of G-CSF) is also effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], but it is difficult to dose appropriately in children.</p><p>The dose of G-CSF suggested for cyclic neutropenia is generally less than that used for severe congenital neutropenia and chemotherapy-associated neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is not used for treatment of cyclic neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factors-in-adult-patients-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia-and-conditions-other-than-acute-leukemia-myelodysplastic-syndrome-and-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H523774212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors in adult patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and conditions other than acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Primary prophylaxis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia#H1852522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>If the nadir of the ANC is consistently &gt;500 microL patients will likely not develop symptoms and do not need to be protected from septic complications. If the average ANC is adequate, the gingiva will generally appear normal and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is normal.</p><p>Since the ANC is cycling, it is important to note that the G-CSF dose cannot be regulated based on a single ANC measurement, as is commonly done post chemotherapy. Once the dose is established, we monitor the ANC and ESR every three to six months and don&rsquo;t make changes if the patient is asymptomatic, the ESR rate is normal, and the ANC is over 500 to 800. CBCs should also be obtained in case of fever or stomatitis, suggesting a lower nadir. Doses of G-CSF should be adjusted in accordance with symptoms and blood counts, not in response to changes in weight, as dosage can be stable for years even in growing children.</p><p>Long-term data from the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) reported that G-CSF treatment lowered the risk of sepsis compared with patients who were not treated (HR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-neutropenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Long-term use of G-CSF in this setting is safe, and there were no reports of acute myeloid leukemia or other hematologic complications after &gt;3000 patient-years of treatment with G-CSF among 356 patients in the registry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ADULT ONSET DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult onset cyclic neutropenia is an autoimmune disorder related to the presence of cytotoxic lymphocytes.

It is caused by mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene (<em>ELANE</em>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Disease overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptoms</strong> &ndash; Symptoms usually begin during the first years of life and consist of recurrent malaise, fever, pharyngitis, gingivitis, and stomatitis, with or without bacterial infections. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia is established by documentation of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL,</span> usually for at least two to three days, in each of two to three regularly spaced cycles. This requires measurement of the ANC at least twice a week for a minimum of six and preferably eight consecutive weeks.

DNA mutational analysis for the ELANE gene is positive in 90 to 100 percent of patients with cyclic neutropenia, and can be helpful in confirming or largely excluding the diagnosis.
