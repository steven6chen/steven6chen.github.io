In the United States alone, TBI annually impacts 475,000 children and causes over 2600 TBI-related deaths, 37,000 hospitalizations, and 435,000 emergency department (ED) visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Approximately 5000 children are disabled due to TBI each year. Moreover, costs of treatment for TBI approximate USD $2.6 billion annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Various mechanisms result in TBI severe enough to require hospitalization. Overall, falls and motor vehicle crashes account for the majority of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Inflicted head injury is a significant mechanism, particularly for infants younger than 1 year of age. As an example, in the United Kingdom, among infants were admitted to intensive care units with head injuries, 52 percent had been abused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, approximately 75 percent of children with multiple trauma have TBI and almost 80 percent of all trauma deaths are associated with TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Mortality rates between 17 and 33 percent have been reported in retrospective series describing children with severe brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. In developed countries, TBI is the most common cause of trauma-related death and disability in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>The highest pediatric morbidity and mortality is reported in children younger than 4 years of age, and in those with hypotension, low GCS scores at initial presentation, coagulopathy, or hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12,17-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17-24</a>]. Overall mortality among children with TBI who are treated in EDs or require hospital admission is 4.5 percent (compared with 10.4 percent among adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite the higher survival in children with TBI, disability is significant with the functional long-term outcome associated with the initial injury severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAIN INJURY CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain injury can be categorized as diffuse or focal: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diffuse brain injury</strong> &ndash; Diffuse brain injury (DBI) is the most common type of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting in death in children and is usually produced by impact, acceleration and deceleration forces. Diffuse traumatic axonal injury (DAI) is a severe form of DBI. DAI develops as the result of tissue shearing at the interface of grey and white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]; focal injuries may also be present in patients with DAI. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although not associated with structural changes on imaging, concussion is a milder form of DBI.

There are two major sources of bleeding in patients with SDH: bridging blood vessels that cross the subdural space and cerebral cortical hemorrhage caused by direct brain trauma. SDH commonly complicates severe brain injury, including abusive head trauma in children. The clinical diagnosis and management of SDH in children is discussed separately.

In retrospective series describing severely head injured children, up to two-thirds have sustained multiple trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,32</a>]. In these cases, death is typically a result of the head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32,33</a>]. The management of multiple trauma in children is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Cervical spine injury (CSI) must always be suspected for children with TBI or injury above the clavicle and evaluation is usually needed. CSI occurs 1 to 2 percent of children with severe blunt trauma. Patients with severe TBI are at significant risk and can be difficult to assess. As an example, in one small observational study, almost 30 percent of children with severe TBI and continued altered mental status or need for endotracheal intubation 72 hours after injury, had comorbid findings on either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Hypoperfusion in conjunction with increased metabolic demand makes the brain more susceptible to secondary insults, such as hypoxemia and hypotension. Cerebral perfusion may be particularly dependent upon maintaining adequate blood pressure because cerebral autoregulation is often impaired following severe pediatric TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38</a>]. In addition, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, glutamate, and aspartate causes neuronal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Following this initial phase, cerebral swelling develops that generally peaks 24 to 72 hours after the injury. The resulting intracranial hypertension can further compromise cerebral perfusion leading to more ischemia, swelling, herniation, and death. Impaired cerebral autoregulation after initial TBI may further reduce cerebral blood flow and result in cerebral ischemia. For example, impaired cerebral autoregulation during the first week after severe TBI is associated with a poor, six-month Glasgow Outcome Score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Diffuse cerebral swelling following severe TBI is more common among infants and children compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Mechanisms that account for this age-related difference are not known. Anatomical and pathophysiological factors likely play a role. As an example, a diffuse pattern of brain injury may develop because the infant skull is more compliant and can tolerate considerable deformation before fracture occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In addition, brain atrophy that probably begins in young adulthood, permits more room in the adult skull for the brain to expand. Finally, experimental data from animals suggest that pathophysiological features, such as enhanced diffusion of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, the inflammatory response of the developing brain, and changes in blood-brain-barrier permeability may also be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The volume relationships between brain parenchyma, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood, as well as physiologic mechanisms that maintain pressure homeostasis (including the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure) within the intracranial compartment are discussed separately.

In children with severe TBI, rapid stabilization is also important to prevent secondary brain injury due to hypoxia and shock.

The approach to imaging in the trauma patient with altered consciousness is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64196\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64196 \">algorithm 2</a>) and discussed separately.

If the patient is hemodynamically stable, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> or, if available, thiopental, are alternatives. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Rocuronium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a> are good choices for paralytic agents. When the reversal agent for rocuronium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sugammadex-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sugammadex</a>, is available, then many experts prefer to use rocuronium. When sugammadex is not available, succinylcholine, if not contraindicated, is preferred because of its shorter duration of paralysis which permits more rapid recovery of the physical examination.

The administration of hypotonic fluids, such as D5W, should be <strong>avoided. </strong>(See <a href=\"#H260265170\" class=\"local\">'Circulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3135662464\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that children with severe TBI be managed according to the 2012 guidelines for management of severe TBI in infants, children, and adolescents and the principles of Emergency Neurologic Life Support (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Emergency consultation with a neurosurgeon with pediatric expertise should occur for all children with moderate to severe TBI. Basic measures for stabilization of children with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and interventions for impending herniation or sustained elevations are described in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110947\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110947 \">algorithm 1</a>).

However, hypothermia should be <strong>avoided</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the injured patient has undergone a primary survey and had all immediately life-threatening injuries stabilized, the next step in management involves a focused history, head-to-toe assessment (secondary survey), and ancillary studies to identify all injuries and proceed with definitive treatment. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Secondary survey'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation depends upon the type and extent of injuries identified during the primary and secondary surveys. Most children with multiple injuries, including severe TBI due to blunt trauma, warrant extensive testing as described above. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All pediatric patients with severe TBI should undergo unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head to identify focal brain injuries that may require neurosurgical intervention including.
