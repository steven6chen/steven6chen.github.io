It is used mainly to treat severe depression, but is also indicated for patients with other conditions, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, catatonia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.</p><p>There is no question about the efficacy and safety of ECT. Nevertheless, it remains controversial and stigmatized because of misinformation and outdated perceptions about how the treatment is performed.</p><p>The goal of ECT is to produce a generalized cerebral seizure under general anesthesia. The technique affects the rate of remission with ECT, which varies from 20 to 80 percent in research studies using different procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, response and remission rates in clinical practice, using standard techniques, are at the higher end of that range. </p><p>The technique for performing ECT is reviewed here.

Most patients are treated according to a protocol that addresses the following issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient safety</strong> &ndash; Confirm the identity of the patient and that the patient is NPO, has taken necessary medications, and signed the informed consent form.

The EEG is typically recorded with one or two channels, from right and left frontal and mastoid positions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F51413\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51413 \">figure 1</a>). ECT devices display the EEG tracing on a paper record <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computer screen, and may also provide information about the adequacy of the recorded seizure by means of automated indices. Despite the device interpretation, interpretation of the EEG remains an important skill for the ECT practitioner.</p><p>EMG is generally recorded from the right foot in order to measure the length of the motor component of the seizure. This corresponds with the possible use of right unilateral electrode placement. A blood pressure cuff is placed and inflated on the right ankle to prevent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> from entering the foot. An alternative to using the EMG is to simply place a blood pressure cuff on the ankle and have a member of the treatment team watch the foot after the electric stimulus is administered and record the duration of tonic-clonic contractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTRODE PLACEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104591374\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard choice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electric current used to induce the seizure passes briefly through the brain via two electrodes (either metal or disposable adhesive) applied to the scalp. Psychiatrists typically position the stimulating electrodes in one of three ways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77514\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77514 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bilateral</strong> &ndash; Bilateral, also known as bitemporal, is the original, &quot;gold standard&quot; placement. One electrode is placed on each temple, with the center of the electrode placed 2 to 3 cm above the midpoint of the line connecting the outer canthus of the eye and the external auditory meatus on each side of the head. Bilateral placement has the greatest antidepressant efficacy and quickest speed of response, but may cause the most memory impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Right unilateral</strong> &ndash; Right unilateral electrode placement consists of placing one electrode on the right temple and one on the scalp, just to the right of the vertex (d'Elia placement). Specifically, one electrode is positioned as in bilateral on the right side, and the center of the other electrode is placed 2 to 3 cm to the right side of the vertex of the skull. This technique avoids initial stimulation of the left cerebral hemisphere, which is usually dominant for language functions. Right unilateral results in slightly lower remission rates, but generally causes fewer adverse cognitive effects such as memory impairment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bifrontal</strong> &ndash; Bifrontal consists of placing each electrode on the forehead above the outer canthus of each eye. The center of each stimulating electrode is placed 4 to 5 cm above the outer canthus of the eye along a vertical line perpendicular to a line connecting the pupils. Some clinicians think that bifrontal is as effective as bilateral, although there is a much smaller evidence base for bifrontal. Cognitive impairment with bifrontal may be comparable to right unilateral. In a randomized, assessor blinded trial that compared bifrontal with right unilateral ECT (up to 16 treatments) in 73 depressed older adult patients, cognitive function as assessed with the mini-mental state examination was comparable for the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>We suggest:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral ECT in more urgent clinical situations, such as life-threatening depression, profound distress, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> catatonia </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right unilateral ECT when there is a significant concern about minimizing retrograde amnesia</p><p/><p>Patients whose symptoms do not respond to right unilateral ECT can be switched to bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Thus, the pre-ECT evaluation should address whether there is a history of cranial injury or neurosurgery with resultant skull defect, which may indicate the need for skull radiographs.

In a randomized trial that compared right unilateral ECT with bilateral ECT in patients with major depression, 31 patients assigned to right unilateral ECT did not substantially improve after eight or more treatments and were then switched to bilateral ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

A second meta-analysis of six randomized trials (n = 400 patients) found that improvement with right unilateral ECT and bifrontal ECT was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104591575\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive impairment is worse with bilateral (bitemporal) ECT than right unilateral ECT, but the difference is generally short lived:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 39 observational studies evaluated neuropsychological function in 1415 depressed patients who were treated with ECT and assessed with standardized tests at baseline and after the course of ECT was completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Tests conducted within three days of the last ECT treatment showed that impairment of global cognition, delayed verbal memory, and autobiographical memory were greater with bilateral ECT than unilateral ECT. However, testing more than three days post-ECT found that cognition was comparable for the two electrode placements. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One randomized trial compared bilateral and unilateral ECT in 149 patients with unipolar or bipolar major depression and found that the adverse cognitive effects of each placement were comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. This somewhat surprising finding may be attributable to the stimulus dosing of right unilateral at six times seizure threshold, whereas the stimulus dosing for bilateral ECT was one and a half times seizure threshold. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Stimulus dose'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second randomized trial compared bilateral ECT (one and a half times seizure threshold) with right unilateral ECT (six times seizure threshold) in 138 patients with unipolar or bipolar major depression, and found that recall of autobiographical memory was better with unilateral than bilateral ECT, both at the end of treatment and at the six-month follow-up assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, the median time to recovery of orientation following ECT sessions was faster with unilateral than bilateral ECT (19 versus 26 minutes). However, cognitive functioning at the end of treatment and at the six-month follow-up was comparable in other domains, including global cognition, executive functioning (eg, planning), attention and working memory, verbal learning for delayed recall, psychomotor speed, and visuo-spatial functioning and memory. &#160; </p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of four randomized trials (n = 287 patients with unipolar or bipolar depression) found that cognitive impairment for up to seven days was greater with bilateral ECT than bifrontal ECT; however, heterogeneity across studies was large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A second meta-analysis of five randomized trials (n = 558 patients) found that cognitive impairment was comparable with right unilateral ECT and bifrontal ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">STIMULUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many years it was assumed that the electric stimulus was relevant only for its ability to elicit a grand mal seizure. It is now clear that the type and intensity of the stimulus contribute to the efficacy and adverse cognitive effects of ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Stimulus type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of stimulus used in ECT devices is a brief pulse (0.5 to 2.0 milliseconds) or ultra-brief pulse (&lt;0.5 milliseconds) wave form. Brief pulse is considered standard due to its efficacy compared with ultra-brief pulse; however, ultra-brief pulse is a reasonable alternative based upon its superior tolerability. The choice thus depends upon urgency of response, prior treatment history, and patient preferences. The outmoded sine wave stimulus should not be used because it causes more cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Evidence regarding the use of brief pulse or ultra-brief pulse stimuli includes a systematic review of six acute studies (four randomized trials and two prospective observational studies) that compared right unilateral brief pulse ECT with right unilateral ultra-brief pulse ECT in 689 patients with major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Remission occurred in more patients treated with brief pulse than ultra-brief pulse (45 versus 34 percent). In addition, the number of ECT treatments that were required was less with brief pulse (9 versus 10). However, retrograde memory, anterograde memory, and global cognitive functioning were each worse with brief pulse than ultra-brief pulse. The magnitude of cognitive impairment was mild to moderate, depending upon the specific cognitive domain. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Stimulus dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of the electric stimulus (amount of electricity) affects efficacy, speed of response, and adverse cognitive effects. Stimulus dose is usually described in terms of either absolute charge (in millicoulombs) or multiple of seizure threshold. Seizure threshold may be estimated or determined empirically at the first treatment session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Establishing the seizure threshold is accomplished by initially setting the ECT device to use a small amount of energy to induce the seizure. If this dose does not produce a seizure, the device is then reset to deliver an incrementally higher dose in an attempt to induce a seizure. This process is repeated until a seizure occurs, which then establishes the seizure threshold. The parameters that determine the stimulus dose include the current and duration of each electrical pulse, frequency of pulses, and the total duration of the series of pulses, </p><p>Stimulus dosing strategies differ between electrode placements. The suggested stimulus dose for bilateral or bifrontal ECT is 1.5 to 2 times seizure threshold. The suggested dose for right unilateral is approximately 6 times seizure threshold, based upon data showing that seizures need to be elicited with stimuli that are several times greater than seizure threshold for unilateral placement to be maximally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Electrode placement'</a> above.)</p><p>The higher dose required for right unilateral occasionally becomes a problem because ECT devices manufactured in the United States are limited to a charge output of 600 millicoulombs by Food and Drug Administration regulations. This prevents a small number of patients with a relatively high seizure threshold from being treated at fully six times seizure threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>It is common for seizure threshold to increase during an acute course of ECT. This may necessitate incrementally increasing the dose of the electric stimulus periodically.</p><p>Clinicians should follow the specific instructions of the ECT device as specified by the manufacturer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of anesthesia for ECT is to provide the patient with a safe, comfortable experience. The anesthesiologist preoxygenates the patient and administers medications to induce unconsciousness and to relax or paralyze skeletal muscles. An anticholinergic drug may be given prior to ECT to prevent bradycardia or asystole.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is preoxygenated with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or face mask while the procedure is being set up, with the goal of maintaining oxygen saturation at or near 100 percent. This makes ECT safer with fewer adverse effects than either a spontaneous (epileptic) seizure or ECT in the past. In addition, the patient is often hyperventilated via bag valve mask immediately prior to delivering the electrical stimulus. This induces cerebral hypocarbia, which increases seizure intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticholinergic medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication with an anticholinergic agent, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> (0.2 mg, IV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> (0.4 mg, IV), is often used to prevent vagally-mediated bradycardia and excess oral and respiratory secretions. Bradycardia with hypotension, and in some cases asystole, is most common at the first ECT treatment, when there is a greater chance of administering a subconvulsive stimulus that leads to parasympathetic discharge unopposed by subsequent sympathetic activity from a seizure. &#160;</p><p>However, anticholinergics may cause or exacerbate tachycardia.

There has been interest in the use of ultrashort-acting narcotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> to replace at least some of the standard induction agents, but this has not been widely adopted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Evidence that supports using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methohexital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methohexital</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> for depressed patients treated with ECT includes a meta-analysis of two randomized trials (n = 78 patients) that compared the two drugs and found that seizure duration was longer with methohexital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Most patients recover muscle strength within minutes of administration (elimination half-life 47 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisatracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisatracurium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mivacurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mivacurium</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> are used only in special circumstances when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> cannot be used. Such circumstances include pseudocholinesterase deficiency, severe neuromuscular disease or injury (quadriplegia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or muscular dystrophy), severe muscular rigidity, recent severe and widespread burns, or significant hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-in-adults/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>].</p><p>Pseudocholinesterase is needed to metabolize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, and its absence will lead to prolonged apnea and muscle relaxation. A pseudocholinesterase level (also referred to as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dibucaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dibucaine</a> number) is measured only in patients with a personal or family history of prolonged apnea following exposure to muscle relaxants.</p><p>It is important to ascertain that the patient is unconscious before proceeding with the muscle relaxant, to avoid unnecessary patient distress. The patient is rendered apneic by the muscle relaxant, at which point the anesthesiologist provides ventilation by bag and mask with 100 percent oxygen.</p><p>The sufficiency of muscle relaxation is determined using a nerve stimulator and observing the decrement and eventual disappearance of response. In addition, the clinician can assess knee and plantar withdrawal reflexes, and can simultaneously observe for fasciculations in the calves and left foot and wait until they subside, usually within one to two minutes of administering the muscle relaxant. Perfusion of the right foot with the muscle relaxant is prevented by an inflated blood pressure cuff on the right ankle.</p><p>Muscle contractions often occur despite the use of a muscle relaxant. As an example, masseter muscles may contract, and thus it is important to remove dentures, if present, prior to administering the electric stimulus. In addition, a member of the treatment team should insert a bite block to protect the teeth, making sure that the tongue is pushed inferiorly and posteriorly in the mouth, and that the chin is held firmly against the bite block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic medications may be administered immediately before or during ECT for the purpose of blunting the hypertensive, tachycardic response to the seizure-induced sympathetic discharge.

The procedures that are used to perform ECT affect the rate of remission, which varies from 20 to 80 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient receives general anesthesia as part of ECT and thus should not eat solid food for six to eight hours prior to the procedure, and not drink clear liquids for 2 hours, except for necessary medications with a small sip of water. The patient should empty his or her bladder before the treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pre-ECT orders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The equipment used for the procedure includes the ECT device, device to monitor vital signs and pulse oximetry, nasal cannula or face mask to provide supplemental oxygen, bag valve mask, oxygen supply, suction apparatus, nerve stimulator to assess degree of motor relaxation, electromyograph, and blood pressure cuffs (arm and ankle). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electric current used to induce the seizure passes briefly through the brain via two electrodes applied to the scalp. Psychiatrists typically position the stimulating electrodes in one of three ways: bilateral, right unilateral, or bifrontal. We suggest bilateral ECT in more urgent clinical situations, and right unilateral ECT when there is a significant concern about minimizing retrograde amnesia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Electrode placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of stimulus used in contemporary ECT devices is a brief pulse (0.5 to 2.0 milliseconds) or ultra-brief pulse (&lt;0.5 milliseconds) waveform. Brief pulse is considered standard, but there is evidence that ultra-brief pulse stimuli may cause less cognitive impairment. The outmoded sine wave form of stimulus causes more cognitive impairment and should no longer be used. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Stimulus type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose of the electric stimulus is usually estimated empirically at the first treatment session. If the initial small dose does not produce a seizure, incrementally higher doses are given until a seizure occurs. The suggested stimulus dose at subsequent treat sessions for bilateral ECT is 1.5 to 2 times seizure threshold, and for right unilateral is 6 times seizure threshold. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Stimulus dose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Electrode placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is preoxygenated with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or face mask while the procedure is being set up. Premedication with an anticholinergic agent, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> (0.2 mg, IV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> (0.4 mg, IV), is often used to prevent vagally-mediated bradycardia. Prophylactic beta blockers may be administered immediately before or during ECT to blunt the hypertensive, tachycardic response to the seizure. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Preoxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anesthetic of choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methohexital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methohexital</a>, given intravenously at a dose of 0.75 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skeletal muscle relaxation is used during ECT to minimize the motor seizure and prevent musculoskeletal injury. The standard agent is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, given intravenously at a dose of 0.75 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Muscle relaxation medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimal duration for a therapeutic ECT seizure is 15 seconds.
