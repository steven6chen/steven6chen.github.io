In this topic review, the definition, classification, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of PPHTN are discussed. In addition, its clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are reviewed.

The transpulmonary gradient is defined as the difference between the pulmonary artery pressure and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.</p><p>Portal hypertension is inferred from history, physical examination, imaging, or pathology that suggests chronic liver disease or portal hypertension. It can be confirmed by hepatic venous catheterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary hypertension is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into five groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients in the first group are considered to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), whereas patients in the remaining four groups are considered to have pulmonary hypertension (PH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>PPHTN is a type of group 1 PAH. This group also includes IPAH (sporadic and hereditary) and PAH due to drugs and toxins, connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, congenital heart disease, schistosomiasis, chronic hemolytic anemia, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The WHO classification system is shown in the table and discussed in greater detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>).

Although infrequent, it was more than five times the expected frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 507 patients with portal hypertension detected PAH in 2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies indicate that the prevalence of PPHTN is highest in patients with end-stage liver disease undergoing evaluation for liver transplantation, with rates ranging from 3.5 to 16.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portal hypertension must exist for portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) to develop. Chronic liver disease without portal hypertension does not cause PPHTN. Causes of portal hypertension that have been described in patients with PPHTN include cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, hepatic vein sclerosis, congenital portal circulation abnormalities, and periportal fibrosis without cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) is unknown, although numerous theories have been proposed. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that a humoral substance (which would normally be metabolized by the liver) is able to reach the pulmonary circulation through portosystemic collaterals, resulting in PPHTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Candidates for this humoral substance include serotonin, interleukin-1, endothelin-1, glucagon, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>, thromboxane B2, and vasoactive intestinal peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/15,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18-20</a>]. Increased plasma concentrations of these mediators have been detected in patients with portal hypertension.</p><p>Alternatively, a genetic predisposition may exist. The observation that PPHTN is infrequent and sporadic among patients with portal hypertension is consistent with this proposal. A gene responsible for some cases of familial PAH has been localized to chromosome 2 (locus 2q33) and defective function of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. This or similar defects may contribute to PPHTN.</p><p>Thromboembolism from the portal venous system also has been proposed as a cause of PPHTN. In this theory, thrombi from the portal circulation pass through portosystemic shunts and reach the pulmonary circulation, thus producing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Arguing against this proposal, a large autopsy study failed to show a significant number of thrombi simultaneously in the portal and pulmonary vascular beds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and some histopathologic features suggest that the pulmonary arterial thrombi sometimes observed in PPHTN usually arise in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The hyperdynamic circulation seen in patients with liver disease may also contribute to the development of PPHTN, with increased blood flow through the pulmonary vascular bed and increased sheer stress on the vascular wall, possibly resulting in PAH. However, this hypothesis is not supported by data suggesting that increased blood flow is readily accommodated by the pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonary histopathologic findings in PPHTN and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) are indistinguishable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66276\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66276 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]. These findings include medial hypertrophy, remodeling of the muscular pulmonary artery walls, and in situ thrombosis.</p><p>Medial hypertrophy is an early and potentially reversible form of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As the diseases advances, medial hypertrophy becomes a component of pulmonary arteriopathy. Two subtypes of pulmonary arteriopathy have been described in patients with PPHTN:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy is characterized by medial hypertrophy, intimal fibrosis, and lesions involving the entire vessel wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombotic pulmonary arteriopathy is characterized by medial hypertrophy, thrombosis, and eccentric, nonlaminar intimal fibrosis. It may arise from in situ thrombosis, rather than emboli.</p><p/><p>It is uncertain whether each subtype is a different stage of the same disease or a different response to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) have clinical evidence of both portal hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Fewer patients present with complaints related to portal hypertension only, without pulmonary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rarely, a patient may present with pulmonary symptoms related to the PAH, without evidence of portal hypertension.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal hypertension &ndash; Manifestations of portal hypertension typically precede those of PAH, with the interval between the first manifestation of portal hypertension and the documentation of PAH ranging from 2 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/17,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30</a>]. Clinical manifestations of portal hypertension are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertension-in-adults#H72827922\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary arterial hypertension &ndash; The pulmonary symptoms associated with PPHTN are similar to those associated with other types of PAH. In a series of 78 patients with PPHTN, the most common presenting pulmonary symptoms were dyspnea on exertion, syncope, chest pain, fatigue, hemoptysis, and orthopnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The most common physical findings were an accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a systolic murmur, and edema. A retrospective study compared the characteristics of 30 patients with PPHTN, 30 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), and 30 patients with chronic liver disease alone, who were awaiting transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The patients with PPHTN had elevated mPAP similar to those with IPAH; however, they had reduced systemic vascular resistance and elevated cardiac index similar to those with chronic liver disease alone.</p><p/><p>Tricuspid regurgitation is common in patients with PAH and is audible as a systolic murmur located along the lower left sternal border that is accentuated with inspiration. Dependent pitting edema is a sign of right ventricular dysfunction. Chest radiographs demonstrate prominent pulmonary arteries and cardiomegaly in most patients. The electrocardiogram (ECG) often demonstrates right ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation, and a right bundle branch block. In one study, only 4 percent of patients had a normal ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portopulmonary hypertension should be suspected in patients with advanced liver disease and the symptoms of PAH Patients suspected of having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) undergo extensive diagnostic testing, which is aimed at identifying the cause of PAH and confirming the presence of PAH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Common diagnostic tests include echocardiography, electrocardiography (ECG), chest radiography or computed tomography, pulmonary function testing, polysomnography, ventilation-perfusion scanning or pulmonary angiography, autoantibody testing, HIV testing, and liver function testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72553\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72553 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Testing should be prioritized according to the patient's history and physical examination. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is the diagnosis of exclusion, if an alternative cause cannot be identified.</p><p>Right heart catheterization is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PAH and estimate its severity. Hepatic venous wedge pressure should also be measured during catheterization to determine the severity of portal hypertension if portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1401098000\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of PPHTN is confirmed when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PAH exists, as indicated by an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and transpulmonary gradient during right heart catheterization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal hypertension exists, as indicated by an elevated hepatic venous pressure during hepatic vein catheterization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative cause of the PAH cannot be identified</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the treatment options for portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) have been extrapolated from studies performed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).

In addition to the patient's baseline hemodynamics determined by right heart catheterization during the diagnostic evaluation, the patient's exercise capacity should be tested and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) or World Health Organization (WHO) functional class determined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62080 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30616613\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PPHTN are at risk for in situ pulmonary vascular thrombosis and thromboembolic disease due to venous stasis, slowed pulmonary blood flow, and right heart enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients with PPHTN also tend to have problems related to volume overload with ascites and anasarca. As a result, anticoagulant and diuretic therapy are often used in patients with PPHTN:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation &ndash; Several studies involving patients with IPAH have suggested that anticoagulation might improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Although patients with PPHTN have not been studied, it may be reasonable to treat such patients with oral anticoagulants if no contraindications exist, particularly when cardiac output is reduced due to right heart failure. When anticoagulant therapy is administered, we advocate a goal international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5 due to the increased risk of hemorrhage in patients with chronic liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics &ndash; The use of diuretics in patients with cirrhosis, including the diuretic regimen and concerns related to fluid removal and hypokalemia, are discussed in detail separately.

Therefore, beta-blockers and TIPS are not routine therapies for PPHTN. In patients with PPHTN for whom beta-blockers or TIPS is indicated for portal hypertension, the decision to initiate these therapies should be made on a case by case basis after carefully weighing the risks versus the potential benefits.

Pure vasodilators do not benefit patients with PPHTN and can cause significant hypotension due to systemic vasodilation and decreased right ventricular filling. Patients with PPHTN are particularly susceptible to this side effect because low systemic vascular resistance usually exists in chronic liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Epoprostenol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoprostenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epoprostenol</a> (prostacyclin, Flolan) is a potent vasodilator with anti-platelet aggregating and antiproliferative properties that improves exercise tolerance and prolongs survival in patients with IPAH, regardless of whether vasoreactivity exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>].

Ten patients were maintained on a continuous intravenous infusion and six of them underwent repeat right heart catheterization that confirmed long-term reduction of PVR.

In eight patients, sildenafil was the first therapy, while sildenafil was added to preexisting inhaled prostanoid therapy in the remaining six patients. Among the 12 patients who completed the study, there was a reduction of mPAP and PVR at three months, but not at one year, compared to baseline.

Some, but not all, patients with PPHTN who have successfully undergone liver transplantation have demonstrated improvement or complete normalization of their pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/48,49,68-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49,68-74</a>]. Outcomes due to liver transplantation and advanced therapy have never been compared.</p><p>It is uncertain whether the severity of the PAH affects outcomes following liver transplantation. Limited data suggest that severe PAH (systolic PAP &gt;60 mmHg) is associated with high perioperative risk and poor clinical outcome, while mild to moderate PAH does not influence mortality after liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/1,8-11,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-11,71</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study of 1205 patients who underwent liver transplantation compared those with PAH to those without PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The three year mortality rate for patients without PAH, with mild PAH (systolic PAP 30 to 44 mmHg), with moderate PAH (systolic PAP 45 to 59 mmHg), and with severe PAH (systolic PAP &gt;60 mmHg) was 28, 33, 35, and 71 percent, respectively.</p><p>The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system is used to predict survival among patients with chronic liver disease, with higher scores correlating with lower survival. Patients with PPHTN should have their MELD score upgraded ten percent every three months while they are on the liver transplantation waiting list; otherwise, the MELD score will underestimate their mortality risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld#H16431890\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;, section on 'Other standard MELD exceptions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN) may have worse outcomes than patients with other types of group 1 PAH. This was suggested by a retrospective cohort study of 174 patients that was performed using data from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (ie, the REVEAL Registry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Compared with idiopathic and familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, patients with PPHTN had worse two-year survival (67 versus 85 percent) and five-year survival (40 versus 64 percent), despite having better hemodynamic measurements and functional class assignments at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>It is possible that the poorer outcomes reflect the observation that, prior to the REVEAL Registry, treatment of PPHTN with advanced therapy was frequently delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. This is supported by evidence that indicates that advanced therapy improves outcome. In a series of 154 patients with PPHTN, survival rates at one-, three-, and five-years were 88, 75, and 68 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Approximately one-third of patients had received advanced therapy during the study. These survival rates are more encouraging than the six-month survival rate of 50 percent that was reported by a study of patients who did not receive advanced therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portopulmonary-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2358609607\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Fewer patients have evidence of portal hypertension without pulmonary symptoms. Reciprocally, pulmonary symptoms without evidence of portal hypertension are rare. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected of having PAH undergo extensive diagnostic testing, which is aimed at identifying the cause of the PAH and confirming the presence of the PAH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72553\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72553 \">algorithm 1</a>). PPHTN is confirmed when PAH exists during right heart catheterization, portal hypertension exists during hepatic vein catheterization, and an alternative cause of the PAH cannot be identified. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with PPHTN and reduced cardiac output due to right heart failure receive anticoagulant therapy if no contraindications exist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Anticoagulant therapy should be considered on a case by case basis for other patients with PPHTN, after carefully weighing the risks versus the benefits. When anticoagulant therapy is administered, we advocate a goal international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5 due to the increased risk of hemorrhage in patients with chronic liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H30616613\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with PPHTN who remain New York Heart Association (NYHA) or World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II, III, or IV despite optimal treatment of the underlying cause of their portal hypertension be treated with advanced therapy that has efficacy in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We prefer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoprostenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoprostenol</a> given more extensive clinical experience and some observational evidence of benefit. Other therapies that can be tried include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosentan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambrisentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ambrisentan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloprost</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Advanced therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver transplantation is a possible treatment for PPHTN. Reports describe patients with PPHTN who have successfully undergone liver transplantation with improvement or complete normalization of their PAH. We suggest that patients with PPHTN be referred for liver transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients who have a good clinical response to advanced therapy, the timing of liver transplantation can be determined by the status of the liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with PPHTN, beta-blockers and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) are potentially harmful and, therefore, they are not indicated as treatments for PPHTN.
