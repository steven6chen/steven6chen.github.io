This includes situations in which the victim is unable to consent because of intoxication, inability to understand the consequences, misperceptions because of age, or other incapacities.</p><p><strong>Rape</strong> &ndash; The legal definition of rape varies from state to state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It generally encompasses nonconsensual vaginal, anal, or oral penetration that involves force or threat of force (physical or psychologic), lack of consent, or inability to provide consent because of age, intoxication, or mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Rape is categorized according to the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stranger rape</strong> describes nonconsensual sexual penetration between individuals who do not know each other before the sexual act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquaintance rape</strong> describes nonconsensual sexual penetration between individuals who know each other in some capacity before the sexual act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Date rape</strong> is a subset of acquaintance rape in which nonconsensual sexual penetration occurs between two people who are in a romantic relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Date rape can occur when the victim is alert and rational, irrational, semiconscious, or unable to respond due to alcohol or other drug use. It can occur between two individuals who have had prior consensual sexual intercourse or other forms of intimacy. Verbal coercion, threats or use of physical force, or the use of alcohol or illicit drugs may occur as precipitating events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In many cases, date rape occurs within the context of a heterosexual dating relationship, with the male as perpetrator and the female as the victim. Same gender and female to male sexual violence also occur in dating relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, because these types of dating violence are not well studied, this topic will focus on heterosexual dating violence with male perpetrators and female victims.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21895543\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescent and young adult women (16 to 24 years of age) are more likely to be victims of sexual assault than are women in all other age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. Adolescents who have experienced a rape or attempted rape are three to four times as likely as those without this history to experience subsequent sexual assault during their college years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>The majority of rapes in adolescent and young adult females are committed by someone who is known to the victim; as many as 80 to 90 percent of rapes on college campuses are perpetrated by a date or acquaintance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Male victims are less likely to report sexual assault than female victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Among female victims, adolescents are more likely to delay seeking medical care than are adult women.</p><p>Disclosure of date rape is affected by the victim's belief in rape myths, attribution of blame (which may be related to the victim's use of alcohol), relationship with the perpetrator (eg, current partner), and the beliefs and stereotypes of the victim's culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Self-blame, shame, and fear of judgment, lack of information, and naivet&eacute; may prevent the victim from seeking care or disclosure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/3,6,21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,21,25,26</a>]. Victims who feel betrayed or question their choices may find it difficult to confide in anyone. Delayed disclosure delays treatment and recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Victims may hold beliefs that prevent them from considering the forced sexual activity to be rape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Many men and women believe that forced intercourse is rape only if a stranger commits the act in a violent and brutal manner, often with the use of a weapon. They also may believe that to be considered rape, the victim must have a &quot;good reputation&quot; and prior actions and behaviors that are beyond reproach. If any of these components is missing, the victim may not believe that she or he was raped &ndash; or she or he may fear that whomever she or he tells will not believe that she or he was raped. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=date-rape-risk-factors-and-prevention#H64192887\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Date rape: Risk factors and prevention&quot;, section on 'Other contributing factors'</a>.)</p><p>Victims also may be confused about whether the incident was forced or consensual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/3,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29</a>].

This is especially true when underage drinking or illegal drug use is involved. Perpetrators may not believe that they are culpable or that any harm was done [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/24,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,32</a>].

Such a reaction demonstrates respect and is critical to keeping the lines of patient-clinician communication open. The health care provider should recognize and appreciate the subjective experience from the patient's perspective. Acknowledging the patient's feelings, concerns, and fears may help to restore their belief in themselves as a normal, healthy individual. The provider can help the patient to identify individuals in the patient's social network who can provide additional support. However, providers must obtain permission from the patient before engaging family members or friends for support (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a>). Offering the patient options for treatment or support and respecting their decisions helps them to regain a sense of control over their life and to realize that they have the ability to make decisions.</p><p>Sexual assault affects the victim's sense of self and their sexuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Internalized feelings of guilt, shame, betrayal, and anger can impede recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The victims should be told, repeatedly if necessary, that they were not responsible: Rape is never the victim's fault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>]. Voluntary use of alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drugs before sexual assault does not diminish the seriousness of sexual assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Because of the potential for long-term psychologic consequences, clinicians should be prepared to offer psychologic support or referral for counseling (eg, to a social worker, counselor, or dating violence hotline). The provision of mental health services (eg, support groups, group therapy, individual therapy) can help to restore a sense of normalcy and provide a therapeutic environment that facilitates recovery. Awareness of community resources can facilitate timely referrals. The names of mental health professionals who are skilled in the care of sexual assault victims may be obtained by calling a sexual assault care center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Funding for care may be available through the <a href=\"http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/about/victimsfund.html&amp;token=Ko+6wTuC72qJCvnS/WDGrN1gRDd1OFBUEQi4CvrCZcFygheoXNExto29/oMtvSWOXdG3JXz2DcbHEkIZJLIlvw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=11616\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Crime Victims Fund</a>.</p><p>It may be helpful to encourage the victim to discuss the incident with a parent or other trusted adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The involvement of such a support person may ensure that the victim receives support and appropriate counseling, particularly if the victim becomes depressed and lacks the initiative or ability to access help. However, it is important to respect the victim's decisions about who and when to tell about the assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20957959\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health concerns that must be addressed in adolescent and young adult sexual assault victims who present soon after the incident include the possibility of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and physical injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, few adolescent victims of sexual assault seek medical care directly following the assault experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Analysis of data from the longitudinal National Women's study indicates that non-white <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> injury, concern about sexually transmitted infection, and having reported the assault to authorities were associated with seeking medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Adolescent and young adult victims of sexual violence are less likely to sustain physical injuries outside of the anogenital area during the assault than are older adult victims [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/date-rape-identification-and-management/abstract/3,13,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,66</a>].
