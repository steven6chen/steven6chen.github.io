The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) Committee on Obstetric Practice states that hospitals and birthing centers are the safest setting for birth, but they respect the right of women to make medically informed decisions about their delivery site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has taken a similar position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and the American Public Health Association (APHA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] have policy statements supporting the practice of planned out-of-hospital birth in select populations of women. The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a statement indicating women can choose to deliver at home if they have low-risk pregnancies, receive the appropriate level of care, and formulate contingency plans for transfer to a <span class=\"nowrap\">properly-staffed/equipped</span> delivery unit if problems arise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the Dutch system, pregnant women without medical complications are asked to choose where they want to give birth: at home or in a short-stay hospital setting. The home birth rate in the Netherlands is the highest in the developed world, although it has declined from 35 percent of all births in 1997 to 2000 to 16 percent of all births in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss planned home birth. Delivery at birth centers and unplanned home birth are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-centers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth centers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precipitous-birth-not-occurring-on-a-labor-and-delivery-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precipitous birth not occurring on a labor and delivery unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UNITED STATES NATALITY DATA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence of home birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of planned home birth varies by country. As an example, the prevalence of home birth in Sweden is 0.1 percent compared with over 20 percent in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For the United States, 0.92 percent of births occurred at home in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The United States National Center for Health Statistics reports birth data based on state vital statistics records, which are determined from the Standard Certificate of a Live Birth (ie, birth certificate). Prior to 1989, births were identified as either occurring in or out of a hospital (eg, home, car, doctor's office). Since 1989, a specific category for home births has been included on the Standard Certificate. Starting in 2003, some states changed their Standard Certificate to identify planned versus unplanned home births. In 2014, 47 states and the District of Columbia reported planning status of birth location, which accounted for 96 percent of all births and 98 percent of home births.</p><p>After a period of decline in home births from 1989 to 2003, the rate of home birth in the United States has been growing. In 2014 (the most recent national figures available), there were 59,674 out-of-hospital births, which represented 1.4 percent of all births. Of the out-of-hospital births, 38,094 were home births and nearly 18,219 occurred in free-standing birthing centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Twelve percent of the home births were unplanned in 2014, ranging from 1 percent (Wisconsin) to 49 percent (Alabama) among the 47 states and District of Columbia reporting these data. Only Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island were not yet reporting the new data. From 1989 to 2003, the overall rate of home births in the United States declined from 0.69 to 0.57 percent of births, or by an average of 0.01 percent annually. The 2014 figures represent a substantial increase in both absolute numbers and rate, reaching 0.96 percent of all births, the highest United States home birth rate since the variable was added to the birth certificate in 1989. Almost all of the increase was attributed to births among non-Hispanic white women.</p><p>This rate is comparable to that in other industrialized countries with two exceptions: England has experienced a slight rise in its home birth rate from 1.0 percent in 1989 to 2.3 percent in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], while the Netherlands had a rate of home birth of approximately 16 percent in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>In the United States in 2014, seven states had home birth rates of more than 2 percent for that year, including: Vermont (2.5 percent), Utah (2.3 percent), Montana (2.2 percent), and Idaho (2.1 percent). These states are predominantly rural; however, some non-rural states also have relatively high rates of home birth: Oregon (2.5 percent), Washington (2.3 percent), and Wisconsin (2.0 percent). In Wisconsin, the home births were disproportionately located in rural counties. In Pennsylvania, the high rate of home birth was due, at least in part, to a large Amish population, which has traditionally relied on home birth. Lancaster County, for example, had the highest home birth rate of any county in the United States: 13.0 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth attendant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the majority of home births are assisted by individuals other than clinicians and certified nurse midwives (CNMs) (the two dominant birth attendants for hospital births) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59460\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59460 \">table 1</a>). In a retrospective review of nearly 62,000 United States home births between 2006 and 2009, the authors combined the &quot;other midwife&quot; and &quot;other&quot; birth attendant categories on the birth certificate (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Provider'</a> below) and reported someone other than a nurse midwife performed 70 percent of the home deliveries and CNMs performed 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Refer to the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59460\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59460 \">table 1</a>) for the 2014 distribution of planned home birth providers.</p><p>In 2014, 50 percent of planned home birth that occurred at home were attended by &quot;other midwives,&quot; typically certified professional midwives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The qualifications of the different types of midwives are described below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Provider'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2014, 22 percent of planned home births had &quot;other&quot; attendants, a residual category for attendants (eg, fathers) who are neither clinicians nor any type of midwife [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In some cases, fathers may sign the birth certificate to protect other birth attendants (eg, direct entry midwives or CNMs) in states with legal restrictions on planned home birth or type of provider for home birth. In other cases, the woman has planned an unassisted birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or has had an unplanned home birth.</p><p>The type of birth attendant in planned home births varies somewhat by <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59460\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59460 \">table 1</a>) with other midwives, CNMs, and &quot;other&quot; ranking first, second, and third, respectively, among all groups. Black non-Hispanic mothers were usually attended by either &quot;other midwives&quot; (41 percent) or a CNM (31 percent), while white non-Hispanic mothers were primarily attended by other midwives (50 percent) or CNMs (28 percent). Hispanic mothers also relied on other midwives (56 percent) or CNMs (36 percent). Clinician attendance at home births is more common among unplanned home births, with 22 percent of unplanned home births attended by a physician and another 64 percent attended by &quot;other.&quot; When clinicians were recorded as home birth attendants, 78 percent of these home births were unplanned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WOMEN WHO CHOOSE HOME BIRTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little systematic research has been performed on the motivation of United States mothers who plan home birth; most studies report survey data from select groups of women. These women tend to be self-reliant, more comfortable with their own intuition than with professional advice, adverse to medical intervention and technology, confident about the normality of childbirth, and they have a belief in their bodies' inherent ability to give birth without interference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Demographics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The table shows demographic data of mothers who gave birth at home (planned and unplanned) in the United States in 2013 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78648 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately one out of every 105 births in the United States overall was a home birth, while for non-Hispanic white women, approximately one out of every 69 births was a home birth. Women who chose home birth were more likely to be white non-Hispanic, older, multiparous, native born, living in a nonmetropolitan county, college graduates, and nonsmokers. They were much more likely to report not having had prenatal care than women who delivered in a hospital. The revised birth certificate provides an opportunity to explore some additional characteristics of mothers in the 41 reporting states. Mothers having out-of-hospital births had lower rates of pre-pregnancy obesity (12.5 versus 25 percent), lower rates of smoking (2.8 versus 8.5 percent), and higher rates of college graduates (39.3 versus 30.0 percent) compared with women planning in-hospital birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mothers in home births were also much more likely to report having paid for the birth out-of-pocket (67 percent) compared with mothers giving birth in a hospital (3 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Reasons for choosing home birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have identified many different reasons women choose to give birth at home, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/16,18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A desire for a low-intervention birth, in particular the avoidance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>, epidural analgesia, pharmacologic pain relief, episiotomy, instrumental vaginal delivery, and cesarean birth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultural or religious concerns (eg, the Amish, religions that proscribe male birth attendants)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A concern about iatrogenic complications of hospital birth; fear of and dissatisfaction with hospital care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A desire for freedom and control in the birth process</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A desire to give birth in a comfortable, familiar environment surrounded by family and friends</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of access to transportation (rural areas)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Economic concerns</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES OF HOME BIRTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have reported the maternal and neonatal outcomes of home birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/24-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-39</a>]. Generally these studies have found that, compared to planned hospital birth, planned home birth is associated with reduced rates of cesarean birth and medical interventions, and similar rates of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, there are significant limitations to the quality of population data available for systematic analysis and, in some cases, on the methodological quality of the studies themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of available data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of birth certificate data to assess outcomes of home birth limits interpretation of findings because birth certificates prior to 2003 did not distinguish between planned and unplanned home births or cases where a home birth resulted in a transfer to a hospital. These omissions created biases in opposite directions. The failure to identify planned home births meant a portion of the home births were the result of emergencies, perhaps involving precipitous labor, which might result in a poorer than average outcome when occurring in a setting unprepared for a delivery. Such cases are not uncommon. As noted above, 2014 birth certificate data from 47 states in the United States revealed that 12 percent of recorded home births were unplanned. In contrast, not accounting for hospital transfers meant those planned home births with potentially the worst outcomes were counted as hospital births. These issues were partially addressed in 2003 when birth certificates were changed to identify planned versus unplanned home births. States were slow to adopt the new certificate, but by 2014, 98 percent of home births recorded on birth certificates included planning status.</p><p>Several reviews have attempted to summarize studies on the perinatal and maternal outcomes associated with home births. Such studies are very difficult to compare because of the lack of data on planning status <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfers to hospitals, use of different outcome measures (eg, neonatal or perinatal death rates), alternative approaches to classification of deaths associated with congenital anomalies, and lack of a similar population of appropriately screened hospital births to use as controls. Confounders that affect comparisons of reported outcomes include differences in: the <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/obstetrical</span> risk status of the parturients, parity (nulliparous versus parous), competence of birth attendants, and birth practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As an example, a study from Southern Australia found that home birth was associated with a significantly higher rate of intrapartum death from asphyxia than hospital birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Review of the perinatal deaths in the planned home birth group identified inappropriate inclusion of women with risk factors for home birth and inadequate fetal surveillance during labor, which highlights the importance of assessing patient and provider factors in home birth outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26621144\"><span class=\"h2\">Variation in home birth support systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many countries have approaches to maternity care very different from that in the United States, and some have much more integrated support systems for <span class=\"nowrap\">women/infants</span> who must be transferred from the home setting to the hospital. As an example, home birth has always been integrated into the maternity system in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Guidelines exist for both routine maternal transfer and obstetric emergencies. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Organization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553115807\"><span class=\"h3\">Meta-analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of 12 English-language peer reviewed publications from developed Western nations evaluated maternal and newborn outcomes associated with planned home or planned hospital birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The challenges in systematically studying home birth outcomes are illustrated by this analysis. It was dominated by a retrospective population-based cohort study from the Netherlands with more than one half million women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but also included a failed attempt at a randomized trial that involved only 11 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and several prospective studies ranging in size from 200 to more than 1000 women. Only two studies from the United States met the inclusion criteria: one involved data from 1976 to 1982 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and the other relied on birth certificate data that could only infer planning status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The largest United States study that had been performed at the time of the meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] was excluded because it did not include a linked comparison group of low-risk hospital births. Subsequent analyses have raised further methodological questions concerning this meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In this meta-analysis, planned home birth was associated with significant reductions in intrapartum interventions (epidural anesthesia, electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, episiotomy, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean deliver); odds ratios ranged from 0.1 to 0.42. Planned home birth was also associated with significant reductions in maternal morbidity (3rd degree laceration, infection, postpartum bleeding, perineal laceration, vaginal laceration, retained placenta); odds ratios ranged from 0.27 to 0.85. There were no maternal deaths. </p><p>Perinatal mortality, which encompasses both fetal deaths and early (up to seven days) neonatal deaths, was similar for both planned home births and planned hospital births. The meta-analysis authors chose to exclude the Dutch study from their analysis of neonatal death because this study only examined early neonatal death, rather than the 28-day standard they chose for the meta-analysis. The Dutch study found no difference between groups in deaths up to seven days; however, when these data were excluded, neonatal death up to 28 days was significantly higher in the planned home birth group: all neonatal deaths OR 1.98 (95% CI 1.19-3.28) and nonanomalous neonatal deaths OR 2.87 (95% CI 1.32-6.25). </p><p>The authors could not determine the reason for the two- to three-fold higher 28 day neonatal death rate in planned home births. They hypothesized that it might be due to less maternal intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a higher risk of respiratory distress and failed neonatal resuscitation in the planned home delivery group. In a subsequent analysis, the authors of the large Dutch study examined neonatal mortality out to 28 days and found no differences in outcomes between planned home births and comparably low-risk hospital births, even when transfers of home to hospital were included in the home birth outcomes. If the 466,112 planned home births from the Dutch study were included in the meta-analysis, it is likely the findings would be notably impacted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/38,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,45</a>].</p><p>The National Institute for Health Care Excellence in the United Kingdom (UK) issued guidelines concerning intrapartum care in December 2014 (updated April 2015), which included the following recommendation concerning place of birth, &quot;Explain to both multiparous and nulliparous women that they may choose any birth setting (home, freestanding midwifery unit, alongside midwifery unit or obstetric unit), and support them in their choice of setting wherever they choose to give birth&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. They based their recommendation on an extensive review of existing research. Because the focus was on the UK system, which provides support for home birth, it is not clear how applicable the recommendations would be in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Prospective studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following findings illustrate data from large prospective studies. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest contemporary prospective study of home births in the United States involved 16,924 women who utilized a midwife as their primary caregiver and planned to deliver at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The results are not population based since they rely on a voluntary reporting system in which 432 midwives (primarily certified professional midwives [CPMs]) contributed data from 2004 to 2009 to a database including almost 200 variables. Women who became higher risk intrapartum were transferred to the hospital. Major findings were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rates of medical intervention for home births were consistently low for this low-risk group of mothers: episiotomy rate 1.4 percent, assisted vaginal birth 1.2 percent, and cesarean delivery rate 5.2 percent (based on the cases transferred to the hospital). The authors did not try to match planned home birth patients to planned hospital birth patients since both groups are self-selected. In particular, their home birth population tended to be healthy, multiparous (78 percent), of above average education and income, and averse to intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>About 11 percent of patients were transferred to a hospital intrapartum and an additional 1.5 percent were transferred postpartum. Primiparous mothers were more likely than multiparous mothers to experience an intrapartum transfer (23 versus 8 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One maternal death occurred three days after the birth of a healthy infant and was attributed to the pregnancy.

The risk for poor neonatal outcome was higher in births to primiparous mothers compared with multiparous mothers, in breech births compared with vertex presentations, and in births to women with a prior cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p>A 2015 prospective cohort study compared nearly 11,500 women who planned home birth at the onset of labor with a midwife to a matched cohort of women with low-risk pregnancies who had planned hospital births attended by midwives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Their primary outcome was stillbirth, neonatal death (&lt;28 days), or serious morbidity (Apgar score &lt;4 at 5 minutes or resuscitation with positive pressure ventilation and cardiac compressions). The births studied occurred between March 31, 2006 and April 1, 2009. Results were stratified by parity. Specific findings included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower rates of labor augmentation, pharmaceutical pain relief, third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations, episiotomy, assisted vaginal birth, and cesarean birth were reported for women undergoing planned home birth. While the differences were statistically significant, the absolute differences in rates in this low-risk population were generally small (eg, cesarean section rate in planned home births was 5.8 percent and 7.9 percent in planned hospital group). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No statistically significant differences were reported for composite measures <span class=\"nowrap\">(perinatal/neonatal</span> morbidity or death; stillbirth, neonatal death) or individual measures (Apgar score &lt;4 at 5 minutes; positive pressure ventilation and cardiac compressions). The absolute rates of poor outcomes in this low-risk population were low and differences were small (eg, primary composite outcome &ndash; 0.4 percent planned home birth and 0.4 percent for planned hospital birth).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One strength of the study is that the same group of midwives attended the home births and the hospital births. Their education and practice included home birth, and they were required by their regulatory college to maintain competence in providing care in the home setting. Thus, any differences that might be seen in newborn outcomes would be unlikely to be related to differences in skills or management of providers. </p><p/><p>An older prospective cohort study of home births from British Columbia, Canada also reported maternal and neonatal outcomes in planned home births were similar to, or lower than, rates in planned hospital births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Strengths of this study were that the same midwives performed both in hospital and home births, the planned hospital birth group was limited to women who met eligibility criteria for planned home birth, and high ascertainment of outcome data.

They do suggest varying risks associated with home birth provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], but are limited by birth certificate data on identifying the training level of the &quot;other midwife&quot; category and the content of the &quot;other&quot; category. An analysis by Danish economists of data from the Netherlands used distance from hospitals to infer the impact of place of birth on outcomes and suggested that, in the Dutch context, there was greater risk in home births for women from lower income districts, but no difference in risk for women from wealthier districts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>In a United States study that analyzed birth outcomes by planned birth location rather than actual delivery site, approximately 16 percent of women planning out-of-hospital births (combined home birth and freestanding birth center) required hospital transfer and their infants had higher rates of perinatal death, neonatal seizures, and neonatal ventilator support compared with infants born of planned in-hospital births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Mothers who planned out-of-hospital births had fewer obstetric interventions (eg, induction, augmentation, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery) and a higher rate of blood transfusion. This study used revised birth certificate data to examine outcomes of out-of-hospital births, both home and birth center births. It included not only planning status but also transfers to hospital and an &quot;intention to treat&quot; framework to include these births in the out-of-hospital category, thereby addressing one of the limitations of prior United States studies. The study drew on data from 2012 to 2013 and included 3203 women who chose and completed an out-of-hospital birth (1968 at home and 1235 at a birth center), and 601 women (0.8 percent) with planned out-of-hospital births but who delivered in the hospital after intrapartum transfer.

Both direct-entry midwives and certified nurse-midwives can apply for this certification. CPMs are required to have out-of-hospital birth experience, and usually practice in homes and birth centers.

In a retrospective United States cohort study of nearly 13 million singleton, non-anomalous, term, normal-weight births, the authors reported neonatal mortality rates (NMR) per 1000 live births of 12.7 for breech presentation, 2.5 for nulliparous births, and 1.7 for births with a gestational age &gt; 41 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

When compared with a similar low risk population cared for by midwives in a hospital setting, the risk of neonatal death in a planned home birth was 8.3 times higher for women with a prior cesarean delivery, 8.1 times higher for women with breech presentations, and 6 times higher for nulliparous mothers. Based on the similar risk levels, women with nulliparous and late-term (&ge;41 weeks) pregnancies should be informed that while the absolute risk of neonatal death is low, the relative risk of a neonatal death in a planned home birth is 5 to 6 times greater than in a hospital birth attended by a midwife. </p><p>Thus, women who are nulliparous or who reach a gestational age of 41 weeks or greater should be counseled antenatally about the increased risks of neonatal mortality in the out-of-hospital birth setting, and this counseling should be documented in the prenatal record.&nbsp;Clinicians managing labor in the out-of-hospital setting are advised to be extra vigilant and opt for earlier hospital transfer in concerning cases, such as in the setting of meconium-stained amniotic fluid. </p><p>While determining the appropriate birth setting ultimately falls upon the woman and her birth provider, women who may be good candidates for an out-of-hospital birth include the following (this should not be considered a complete list):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman who has chosen home birth on the basis of informed consent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Singleton, cephalic fetus at term</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of preexisting serious medical conditions (eg, cardiac, renal disease, coagulopathy, diabetes mellitus managed with insulin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior vaginal birth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of serious obstetrical conditions (eg, preeclampsia, antepartum bleeding)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No prior cesarean deliveries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of contraindications to vaginal birth (eg, placenta previa, active genital herpes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous labor</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2720169\"><span class=\"h2\">Group B streptococcus and home birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group B streptococcus (GBS) screening and&nbsp;intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis&nbsp;for women planning home birth is controversial.

While rates have fallen in recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the continued high rate of home births in the Netherlands (16 percent) is unique among industrialized countries and is a legacy of a strong reliance on independent direct entry midwives, a widespread view among families that birth is a natural process, a generalized questioning of the use of technological interventions in medicine, a view of obstetricians as specialists in high risk births only, and a pride in the uniqueness of their status as center for home birth in the industrialized world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/12,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,73</a>]. This system has several important features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A highly organized system of midwifery care. Dutch midwives are trained in a four-year program that prepares them to practice in the hospital or in the home and to recognize and manage some pregnancy complications. Early pregnancy care is primarily delivered by independently practicing midwives. If complications occur or threaten to occur, the midwife refers the woman to an obstetrician at the secondary or tertiary care level. At that point, the woman is no longer eligible for home birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formal agreements for collaboration between professional groups that have been specified in the Verloskundig Vademecum (Obstetric Manual), which also includes a list of obstetric indications for referral from primary to secondary care, based on best evidence or consensus.

In Amsterdam, 85 percent of urgent obstetric referrals arrived in the hospital within half an hour. In addition, the midwife is able to provide some interventions herself in the woman's home, such as the administration of an intravenous infusion and provision of basic life support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of intervention, eg, pharmacologic methods of pain relief are not offered to women laboring at home.</p><p/><p>Periodic measurement of temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate is part of the ongoing assessment of labor, not interventions, and should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A clean delivery kit should be available.

In contrast, 8 percent of multiparous women were transferred (5 percent during labor and 3 percent after the birth). Of all transfers, only 3.8 percent were considered potentially urgent.</p><p>Ideally, the back-up hospital should provide 24-hour maternity care and should be within 15 minutes of the home, but this may not be possible, especially in some geographic areas where home birth is more common precisely because of the lack of nearby hospitals. In such settings, home birth providers should have a lower threshold for transferring patients to the hospital and must consider the transfer time when caring for patients in labor. Women delivering in homes that are remote from a hospital should be informed by their home birth provider during prenatal care that in the case of an unforeseen catastrophic complication (eg, abruption, cord prolapse), they may not be able to transfer to the hospital in time to avoid maternal or neonatal injury or death.</p><p>An optimum outcome is facilitated when hospital providers, including nurses, clinicians, and hospital-based midwives, communicate in a respectful manner with home birth providers and their clients during the transfer process. Home birth providers and their clients sometimes report that they are treated &quot;punitively&quot; or disrespectfully by hospital staff when a transfer occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/18,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,75</a>]. This perception may lead to a delay in a needed transfer, thereby increasing the risks of morbidity to mother and baby.

Good communication between home birth providers and hospital staff will allow conveyance of this information and a smoother transition for the patient.</p><p>Providers should also be aware that women transferred to the hospital after an attempted home birth may be very disappointed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fearful of hospital transfer; putting such patients at ease may facilitate patient care. The use of the expression &quot;failed home birth&quot; is discouraged, as it is unnecessarily negative, as opposed to a neutral expression such as &quot;home birth transfer.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2871553993\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

After remaining fairly stable over recent years, the rate is rising, suggesting ongoing interest in this approach to childbirth. The Netherlands have the highest rate of planned home birth (16 percent of births) among industrialized countries. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of home birth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who opt for home birth in the United States are predominantly white non-Hispanic, older, and multiparous. Some common reasons for choosing home birth include a desire for a low-intervention birth with family and friends in a familiar environment, more control of the birth process, and dissatisfaction with hospital care. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Women who choose home birth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large cohort studies using intent-to-treat analysis of midwife-attended, planned, out-of-hospital birth of low-risk women in developed countries have reported reduced rates of cesarean birth, perineal lacerations, and medical interventions, and similar rates of maternal morbidity and mortality compared with planned hospital birth. While most studies report similar morbidity and mortality for infants born at home compared with those born in hospitals, at least one study reports a higher rate of perinatal morbidity and mortality for infants delivered in hospitals after being transferred from a planned out-of-hospital birth compared with infants born of planned in-hospital births. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of home birth'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following are suggested minimum criteria for planning a home birth:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Informed consent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Singleton cephalic fetus at term.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of preexisting serious medical or obstetrical conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of contraindications to vaginal birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The prenatal care, labor, birth, and postpartum care should be attended by a licensed obstetrical caregiver and there should be a transport plan in case a hospital providing obstetrical care becomes necessary. Ideally, the back-up hospital should provide 24-hour maternity care and should be within 15 minutes of the home. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good communication and mutual respect between home birth providers and hospital staff are essential for patient care and safety when a woman is transferred from home to hospital. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hospital transfer'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/planned-home-birth/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">ACOG Committee on Obstetric Practice.
