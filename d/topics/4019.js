In a prospective observational cohort study, the classic meningitis triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status was present in 70 of the 258 patients (27 percent) with meningococcal meningitis; when rash was added, 89 percent of patients had at least two of these four signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The classic triad is much more common in pneumococcal meningitis (58 percent in the same cohort study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Presenting manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Myalgias may be an important differential sign, and occasionally the pain is quite intense. These are generally more painful than myalgias seen in viral influenza. Disease progression is usually quite rapid with transition from health to severe disease in a matter of hours.</p><p>Because of the trend for endemic meningococcal infection to occur during the late winter when concurrent influenza virus is in the community, many cases of meningococcal disease are mistaken initially for severe &quot;flu.&quot; It is also not uncommon for other cases to have been reported in the region or for the patient to have been a contact of a previously diagnosed case.</p><p>Alternatively, preceding symptoms of pharyngitis, which in meningococcal meningitis is nonsuppurative, can lead to a preliminary misdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. However, patients with meningococcal meningitis either present with, or soon develop, a degree of illness that is much too severe to warrant this diagnosis. The patient will frequently tell the physician that this is the sickest they have ever felt; many express the feeling that they are going to die. With infants, the parents are frequently more worried than the early symptoms may warrant.</p><p>The clinical expression of this infection ranges widely, and, thus, a high index of suspicion and a careful search for clues of disease are required to make a diagnosis, particularly in the absence of an epidemic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The difficulty in identifying meningococcal disease is due, in part, to the fact that clinicians in the community see so few cases in their lifetime and that the classic clinical features of meningococcal disease (eg, hemorrhagic rash, meningismus, and impaired consciousness) appear late in the illness. The critical need for diagnosis as early as possible, because of the narrow time window between progression from initial symptoms to death, prompted a systematic study of the occurrence of symptoms before admission to the hospital in children and adolescents (aged &le;16 years) with meningococcal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Data were obtained from questionnaires answered by patients and primary care physician records of the clinical symptoms and signs of infection before admission to the hospital in 448 children (103 fatal and 345 nonfatal). The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median time between onset of symptoms and admission to the hospital was &le;22 hours:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>22 hours in those children aged 15 to 16 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>20 hours in those children aged 5 to 14 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>14 hours in those children aged 1 to 4 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>13 hours in those younger than 1 year</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific symptoms common to many self-limiting viral illnesses (eg, fever, headache, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and upper respiratory symptoms, such as sore throat and coryza) were the earliest clinical symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first specific clinical symptoms were signs of sepsis in all age groups:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leg pain (in 31 to 63 percent, excluding infants)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cold hands and feet (in 35 to 47 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal skin color such as pallor or mottling (in 17 to 21 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first classic symptom of meningococcal disease was rash, which sometimes evolved from nonspecific to petechial to hemorrhagic over several hours (in 42 to 70 percent of cases).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median time of onset of specific meningitis symptoms (eg, neck stiffness, photophobia, bulging fontanelle) was approximately 12 to 15 hours after onset of illness. Late signs of meningitis (eg, unconsciousness, delirium, or seizures) occurred at a median of 15 hours in infants under 1 year of age and 24 hours in older children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children (72 percent) had one of the three sepsis symptoms (eg, leg pain, abnormal skin color, or cold hands and feet) at a median time of 8 hours after the onset of illness, 11 hours sooner than the median time of hospital admission (19 hours).</p><p/><p>The authors suggested that both clinicians and parents should be educated regarding the frequency and importance of the early signs of sepsis (eg, leg pain, cold hands and feet, and abnormal skin color) as potential warning signs of meningococcal disease. The study was limited by retrospective data collection, recall bias, and the absence of similar data collection for children with other illnesses to compare frequency of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Worrisome signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although initial clinical features of patients with meningococcal disease are similar to many common, self-limiting viral illnesses seen in primary care, signs of early sepsis should differentiate the patient who merits clinical monitoring. Based on the retrospective review of 448 children with meningococcal disease cited above, signs and symptoms suggesting early sepsis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold hands and feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal skin color (eg, pallor or mottling)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vital signs often show a low blood pressure with an elevated pulse rate. The patient should be examined for postural hypotension as a sign of early vascular instability. Diaphoresis is common. Patients will frequently respond to intravenous infusions with transient rises in blood pressure and an improved sense of wellbeing. This can be misleading and result in a delay in initiating definitive antimicrobial and supportive therapy.</p><p>A careful physical examination should be performed. An intensive search for petechiae and ecchymoses should be undertaken. The patient should be examined fully undressed. Sites where pressure is applied to skin by belts and elastic straps are prime locations to find petechiae. The physical examination should also include provocative tests for meningeal irritability, such as the Kernig and Brudzinski signs. However, the absence of signs of meningitis does not exclude the diagnosis of systemic meningococcal infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The petechial rash appears as discrete lesions 1 to 2 mm in diameter, most frequently on the trunk and lower portions of the body. The mucous membranes of the soft palate, ocular, and palpebral conjunctiva must be carefully examined for signs of hemorrhage. Over 50 percent of patients will have petechiae upon presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Petechiae can coalesce into larger purpuric and ecchymotic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52107\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52107 \">picture 1</a>). The petechiae correlate with the degree of thrombocytopenia and clinically are important as an indicator of the potential for bleeding complications secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).</p><p>A maculopapular eruption resembling a wide variety of viral exanthems, particularly rubella, can be an early finding in meningococcemia. This transient rash generally does not persist for more than two days and has frequently disappeared hours after its first observation; it is neither purpuric nor pruritic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The shock state is frequently dominant in the manifestations of meningococcal meningitis. The patient is poorly responsive, and peripheral vasoconstriction is maximal with cyanotic poorly perfused extremities. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrates evidence of acidosis and, depending on the degree of shock, hypoxia may be manifest with arterial PO<sub>2</sub> below 70 mmHg. In addition to the direct effects of meningococcemia, adrenal infarction leading to adrenal insufficiency (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) can contribute to the hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably the most dramatic consequence of this clinical problem is the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of this problem in patients with meningococcal sepsis may be related in part to high levels of circulating microparticles that originate from platelets or granulocytes and have procoagulant activity. In one report, those with the most severe manifestations had microparticles which, when added to normal plasma in vitro, generated a substantial amount of thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Clinical evidence of DIC becomes apparent with extension of subcutaneous hemorrhages, gastric or gingival bleeding, or oozing at the sites of venipuncture or intravenous infusions.</p><p>A number of studies have shown that patients with DIC and purpura fulminans, especially children, have low levels of protein C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein C deficiency&quot;</a>). Protein C appears to play a role in anticoagulation but also in modifying inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One study examined vascular endothelial integrity, endothelial protein C receptor, and plasma thrombomodulin in children with meningococcal sepsis and found intact endothelial cells in both thrombosed and unaffected vessels in skin biopsy specimens but decreased expression of endothelial thrombomodulin and protein C receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Plasma thrombomodulin was higher in patients with meningococcal sepsis compared with healthy controls. The authors concluded that protein C activation in endothelial cells might be disordered in patients with severe meningococcal sepsis. Protein C replacement is being investigated as a possible therapeutic agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-meningococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of meningococcal infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Purpura fulminans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Purpura fulminans is a severe complication of meningococcal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], occurring in approximately 15 to 25 percent of those with meningococcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It is characterized by the acute onset of cutaneous hemorrhage and necrosis due to vascular thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Initially, there is cutaneous pain followed by erythema and petechiae. Ecchymoses develop and these lesions, if the course is not altered with therapy, evolve into painful indurated, well-demarcated purple papules with erythematous borders. These areas progress to necrosis with formation of bullae and vesicles. Gangrenous necrosis can follow with extension into the subcutaneous tissue and occasionally involves muscle and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with purulent meningitis due to <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> or <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, focal neurologic signs and seizures are less common in meningococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Evidence of meningeal irritation is common in meningococcal meningitis except in the very young and old, and the degree of alteration in the level of consciousness is very similar in cases caused by any of the three bacteria.

The cause of death appears to be related to toxins such as lipopolysaccharides produced by the organism or to the secondary effects of cerebral edema on the vital centers in the midbrain region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of investigators have stressed myocardial manifestations associated with meningococcal meningitis, including heart failure with pulmonary edema and high central venous pressures accompanying signs of poor peripheral perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Treatment of myocardial failure can ameliorate the situation.

In one series of 12 children with meningococcemia, those with evidence of myocardial dysfunction on serial echocardiograms had a higher incidence of fatal outcomes (three of seven children versus zero of five) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Infective endocarditis due to <em>N. meningitidis</em> is a very rare occurrence in the antibiotic era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

These include immune complex&ndash;associated complications such as arthritis without the recovery of organisms, pleurisy, vasculitis, and pericarditis (see below). Epiglottitis, conus medullaris syndrome, and cranial nerve dysfunctions, especially sixth, seventh, and eighth, can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/19,29-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Association between lipooligosaccharide levels and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal toxin associated with meningococcal infection is the outer membrane glycolipid, lipooligosaccharide (LOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathobiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathobiology of Neisseria meningitidis&quot;</a>). Investigators have measured LOS in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infected patients and have shown that there is a close correlation between LOS levels and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Patients with septicemia without meningitis, for example, had high LOS levels in plasma and low levels in CSF. By contrast, LOS levels were higher in CSF in patients with meningitis, even without clinical evidence of shock (18 of 19 patients had detectable LOS in the CSF versus 3 of 19 with detectable levels in plasma).</p><p>Meningococcal LOS is present in plasma as a component of bacterial membranes either released from lysed bacteria or by the meningococcal blebbing process (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathobiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathobiology of Neisseria meningitidis&quot;</a>). Bacterial outer membrane fragments have been found in the plasma of three patients; in one of these patients, plasma contained a bacterium covered with multiple, long membrane protrusions, indicating that surplus outer membrane (blebbing) occurs in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the endotoxin from patients with meningococcal sepsis was of meningococcal origin rather than arising from the gastrointestinal tract due to increased permeability during infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The release of LOS from the surface of the meningococcus in the form of copious amounts of outer membrane blebs is now considered to be the principal factor associated with the high endotoxin levels observed in meningococcal sepsis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality rates in patients with meningococcal meningitis are approximately 10 to 15 percent despite antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-meningococcal-infection/abstract/4,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,43</a>].

The clinical manifestations of meningococcal disease can be quite varied, ranging from transient fever and bacteremia to fulminant disease with death ensuing within hours of the onset of clinical symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute systemic meningococcal disease is most frequently manifest by three syndromes: meningitis alone, meningitis with accompanying meningococcemia, and meningococcemia without clinical evidence of meningitis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Meningitis and acute meningococcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical initial presentation of meningitis due to <em>N. meningitidis</em> consists of the sudden onset of fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, decreased ability to concentrate, and myalgias in an otherwise healthy patient. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myalgias may be an important differential sign, and occasionally the pain is quite intense. These are generally more painful than myalgias seen in viral influenza. Disease progression is usually quite rapid with transition from health to severe disease in a matter of hours. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preceding symptoms of pharyngitis, which in meningococcal meningitis is nonsuppurative, can lead to a preliminary misdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. However, patients with meningococcal meningitis either present with, or soon develop, a degree of illness that is much too severe to warrant this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical expression of this infection ranges widely, and, thus, a high index of suspicion and a careful search for clues of disease are required to make a diagnosis, particularly in the absence of an epidemic. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although initial clinical features of patients with meningococcal disease are similar to many common, self-limiting viral illnesses seen in primary care, signs of early sepsis should differentiate the patient who merits clinical monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Worrisome signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vital signs often show a low blood pressure with an elevated pulse rate. An intensive search for petechiae and ecchymoses should be undertaken. The physical examination should also include provocative tests for meningeal irritability, such as the Kernig and Brudzinski signs. However, the absence of signs of meningitis does not exclude the diagnosis of systemic meningococcal infection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningococcal meningitis and meningococcemia often result in shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and purpura fulminans. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Meningitis and acute meningococcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of complications have been documented in patients with meningococcal meningitis either at the time of presentation or, more commonly, later in the recovery phase of illness. These include immune complex&ndash;associated complications such as arthritis without the recovery of organisms, pleurisy, vasculitis, and pericarditis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality rates in patients with meningococcal meningitis are approximately 10 to 15 percent despite antibiotic treatment.
