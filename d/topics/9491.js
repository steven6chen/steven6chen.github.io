However, since the precise role of prothrombotic states in stroke pathophysiology remains unclear, clinical practice regarding screening for prothrombotic states and subsequent treatment varies by center.

Our approach is in agreement with guidelines from the American Heart Association Stroke council, which recommend prothrombotic testing for all children with arterial ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-in-children-evaluation-initial-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In our clinical experience, this approach is especially important for children with congenital heart disease. These children undergo frequent instrumentation and line placement. While the cardiac defect is a strong risk factor for stroke, identification of a prothrombotic abnormality that may be a second risk factor for stroke can influence management. As an example, anticoagulation may be instituted in children with congenital heart disease and a prothrombotic state to prevent clot formation and possible stroke during high risk periods.</p><p>However, the evidence supporting this approach is limited, and some experts reserve hypercoagulable testing only for children who do not have an obvious alternative explanation for the stroke.</p><p>The following studies are suggested as part of the evaluation for a hypercoagulable state in children:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein C functional</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein S free and total or protein S functional</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithrombin III activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipoprotein (a)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homocysteine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prothrombin gene mutation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor V Leiden gene mutation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (IgG and IgM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus anticoagulant tests, including dilute Russell viper venom time and dilute activated PTT </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor VIII activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-dimer</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasculitis evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following studies are suggested whenever there is clinical suspicion of vasculitis, inflammation, or infection as the cause of ischemic stroke in children:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral digital subtraction angiography</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibody assay</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varicella titers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus testing (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection-in-infants-and-children-younger-than-18-months\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for HIV infection in infants and children younger than 18 months&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Treatment&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum nontreponemal tests (eg, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When there is suspicion for late forms of neurosyphilis, serum treponemal tests (eg, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] or Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TPPA]) should be performed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurosyphilis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurosyphilis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination with cell count, differential, protein concentration, and acid-fast bacilli testing; in patients with suspected neurosyphilis, testing should include determination of the CSF-VDRL titer</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">MELAS evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is suspected on clinical grounds, the evaluation includes, in part:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactate levels from serum and cerebrospinal fluid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular genetic testing (of blood leukocytes, cultured skin fibroblast, skeletal muscle, urine sediment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cheek mucosa)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle biopsy, particularly if genetic testing is nondiagnostic</p><p/><p>These studies are not always abnormal in patients with MELAS because of heteroplasmy for mitochondrial mutations.
