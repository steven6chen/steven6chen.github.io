UC affects the colon, whereas CD can involve any component of the gastrointestinal tract from the oral cavity to the anus. These disorders have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics, but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The peak incidence of IBD occurs in patients between the ages of 15 and 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of patients with CD and 12 percent of patients with UC develop their IBD before the age of 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Both adults and children with IBD may present with similar clinical features; however, children can develop unique complications, including growth failure and delayed puberty. Clinicians caring for children and adolescents with one of these disorders must treat the underlying disease and its complications and must also carefully monitor linear growth, skeletal development, and puberty. </p><p>The epidemiology and role of environmental factors in IBD in children and adolescents will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of CD and UC in children and adolescents and the role of genetic factors are presented in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe or refractory ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two issues related to genetic factors in IBD: factors that increase the susceptibility to IBD and genetic syndromes that are associated with an increased risk of IBD. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with IBD are diagnosed in late childhood and adolescence. However, both Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have been reported as early as infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. Most information pertaining to the epidemiology of IBD is based upon adult studies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Time trends in pediatric IBD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of IBD in children appears to be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-12</a>]. A study from Ontario, Canada reported that the incidence of IBD increased from 21.3 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 26.2 per 100,000 in 2008, with the most rapid increase in incidence in children under 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The overall prevalence of IBD was 534 per 100,000 population (approximately 1 in 200 population). A study from Finland also suggests that the incidence of IBD in children doubled during a 15-year period from 1987 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A study from Australia reported an 11-fold increase of UC over a 20-year period beginning in the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Prevalence data from commercially insured patients in the United States describes modest increases in both UC and CD between 2004 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and prevalence of IBD varies by geographic location. The global distribution of CD and UC are similar. Both occur more commonly in North America, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia than in southern Europe, Asia, and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There seems to be a north-to-south gradient with higher incidence rates of both CD and UC in northern locations, even within individual countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H531100387\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, epidemiology, and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Most incidence data for CD and UC in the pediatric population originate from geographic regions with higher rates of IBD. Given the significant rise in age-specific incidence in the teenage years, the reported incidence rates of pediatric CD and UC may vary secondary to differences in the age definition of the pediatric population for each study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, a pediatric population limited to individuals younger than 15 years of age may yield a different incidence rate of CD and UC than a pediatric population defined as younger than 17 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Racial and ethnic predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial studies suggested a lower rate of IBD in non-Caucasian populations, but these results may reflect underrepresentation of non-Caucasians in the regions of study. Although the incidence of IBD among blacks in developing countries such as Africa is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], data from urban areas of the United States suggest that rates are similar in African-American and Caucasian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A study from Saudi Arabia identified a 30 percent prevalence of consanguinity in children with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Both CD and UC occur more commonly among Jewish than non-Jewish peoples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The rates of IBD in Israel vary by the place of birth. The prevalence rates for CD among immigrants from Europe in the United States are higher than in patients of Jewish descent from Asia and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Although the prevalence of IBD tends to be higher overall, disease rates in people of Jewish origin vary by geographic region and parallel those of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The higher rates of IBD in those with Jewish origins across different countries support a genetic predisposition; yet, the geographic variation of IBD rates also suggest potential environmental factors that may influence such an inherited predisposition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Age-related characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As compared with adults, children with IBD appear to be more likely to present with extensive intestinal involvement and have rapid clinical progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Children also are more likely to have a family history of IBD, suggesting a stronger genetic association for IBD presenting during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H216504648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Early onset IBD'</a>.)</p><p>Data from a multicenter pediatric IBD registry provide a description of the characteristics of pediatric IBD according to age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This registry is comprised of six pediatric medical centers in different geographic areas of the United States. Between January 2000 and November 2002, 1370 children (0 to 17 years) with IBD were enrolled; both incident and prevalent cases were included. The following observations were made: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean age at diagnosis was 10.3 years; 15 percent of patients were diagnosed before age 6 years (6 percent before three years), 48 percent at 6 to 12 years, and 37 percent at 13 to 17 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history (including both first-degree relatives and extended family) was positive for IBD in 29 percent of patients overall, and 44 percent of children with UC who were younger than three years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated colonic disease, whether CD, UC, or indeterminate colitis, was more common among children younger than eight years than among older children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among children younger than eight years, indeterminate colitis and UC were more frequent than CD (adjusted risk ratio 3.7 [95% CI 1.6-5.2] and 2.4 [95% CI 1.8-3.2], respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proportion of cases of indeterminate colitis decreased with increasing age, from 33 percent in those diagnosed before 3 years of age to 9 percent among 13- to 17-year-olds, suggesting that indeterminate colitis may represent an evolving form of IBD that presents before definitive phenotype, or that current classification criteria to differentiate UC from CD may not be applicable to young children. &#160;</p><p/><p>In a large study using data from national insurance claims in the United States, IBD was far more prevalent in adolescents than in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Approximately 85 of every 100,000 adolescents aged 15 to 20 years old have UC. In contrast, only 2.3 of every 100,000 children under age five have UC. Similarly, the prevalence of CD in adolescents is 58 per 100,000, as compared with 5.4 per 100,000 in children under age five years. Because these data reflect prevalence, each age category includes incident cases diagnosed at a younger age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lack of total concordance of disease among monozygotic twins and differences in rates of IBD among migrant populations support a role for environmental factors in the development of IBD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, epidemiology, and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several environmental factors identified in the literature are listed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinatal and early exposures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The literature remains mixed as to the relationship of Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) with breastfeeding exposure. Breastfeeding stimulates the development and maturation of the gastrointestinal mucosa of infants and may protect them from gastrointestinal infections in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Several studies suggest that IBD patients were less likely to have been breastfed as infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In a study focusing on child-onset CD, children with CD were more than three times less likely to have been breastfed than their unaffected siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The same group found no association with breastfeeding practices and the risk of developing UC in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, two other studies examining pediatric-onset IBD demonstrated no relationship between breastfeeding and either CD or UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Retrospective studies have identified a high incidence of infantile cow's milk protein sensitivity in children with IBD. However, this finding may only reflect recall bias by the parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Several authors have suggested that exposure to infections in the perinatal period or early life may contribute to the development of IBD. Individuals with CD or UC were more likely to have experienced a diarrheal illness during infancy when compared with their unaffected siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. In addition, exposure during early childhood to antibiotics that target anaerobic bacteria may increase the risk for IBD. This was suggested in a large population study from the United Kingdom, in which antianaerobic antibiotic exposure increased the relative risk for IBD by 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The risk was greatest for exposures before one year of age (adjusted hazard ratio 5.51, 95% CI 1.66-18.28), as compared with later in childhood or adolescence (adjusted hazard ratios 2.62 by age 5, and 1.57 by age 15).</p><p>An association between measles virus infection and CD has been suggested but not confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A study from the United Kingdom did not find any association between the development of CD and birth during measles epidemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Similarly, proposed associations between measles vaccine and CD have not been substantiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Conversely, some environmental factors may be protective against the development of IBD. Some studies suggest that contact with farm animals during early life reduces the likelihood of developing IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The effect sizes were small, and other studies concluded that pet exposure has the opposite effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Nonetheless, the observations are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to infectious pathogens early in life confers protection against some immune-mediated diseases (the &quot;hygiene hypothesis&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Some of these risk factors or protective mechanisms may be mediated through changes in the gut flora. The correlation between IBD and specific microorganisms, and the association between IBD and exposures that alter gut flora are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H531113796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, epidemiology, and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the constant intestinal exposure to numerous luminal dietary antigens, it seems reasonable to postulate a relationship between diet and IBD. Ecological and case-control studies suggest an association between certain foods and development of IBD. For example, refined sugar intake has been associated with IBD, especially CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. However, methodological issues of these retrospectively designed studies, such as the collection of pre-illness diet, present a challenge to the interpretation of the findings. In particular, the recalled dietary intake may reflect changes in the diet due to the effects of the disease itself, rather than the individual's dietary habits preceding the onset of disease. More recent publications include both retrospectively and prospectively designed studies, and suggest that intake of total, mono- or polyunsaturated fats are positively associated with IBD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>], while intake of dietary fiber (eg, in fruits) or vitamin D are inversely associated with CD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. In a prospective cohort study, high intake of dietary trans-unsaturated fats was associated with increased risk for UC, and high intake of dietary long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was associated with reduced risk for UC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

This possibility was supported by the observation that omega-3 PUFAs may modulate immune responses by decreasing the production of cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an inflammatory mediator with potent neutrophil chemotactic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], and by geographical correlations between incidence rates of IBD and dietary omega-3 PUFAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. However, placebo-controlled trials and systematic reviews have failed to support this contention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

In contrast, current smoking is associated with a 50 percent decrease in the risk of UC. In children and adolescents, smoking initiation or exposure to second-hand smoke is associated with an increased risk for developing CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

The evidence for an association between oral contraceptives (OCPs) and IBD is less clear than for smoking. Individuals who have had an appendectomy appear to have a lower risk for developing UC.

However, both CD and UC have been reported as early as infancy. The incidence of CD in children appears to be increasing, but varies by geographic region and ethnicity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As compared with adults, children with IBD appear to present with more extensive intestinal involvement and have rapid clinical progression. Young children with CD are also more likely to have disease limited to the colon. Children also are more likely to have a family history of IBD (present in approximately 20 to 30 percent), suggesting a stronger genetic association for IBD presenting during childhood. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Age-related characteristics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of total concordance of disease among monozygotic twins and differences in rates of IBD among migrant populations support a role for environmental factors in the development of IBD. Proposed risk factors include lack of breastfeeding, viral infections, and several dietary factors. Smoking may have differential effects on the risk of CD and UC. The majority of studies examining these factors are retrospective and subject to recall bias, and none of these risk factors have been established.
