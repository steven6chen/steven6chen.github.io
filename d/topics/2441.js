Based upon the etiology of calcium deposition, there are five subtypes of calcinosis cutis: dystrophic, metastatic, idiopathic, iatrogenic, and calciphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101583 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dystrophic calcinosis cutis:</strong> Dystrophic calcinosis cutis results from local tissue damage.

Tissue damage, in the way of structural damage, hypovascularity, or tissue hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], promotes an increased intracellular calcium influx, leading to mineralization of the tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Dystrophic calcification is the most common type of calcinosis cutis.

The calcium deposits are composed of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals and most frequently form at sites of recurrent microtrauma. The most frequently involved sites are the feet and hands (particularly fingers), followed by the extremities (excluding hands and feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Occasionally, calcinosis involves the trunk or head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As the calcified deposits enlarge, they may ulcerate or become exophytic, exuding a chalky white-yellow material. Calcinosis cutis may be more prominent in patients with anticentromere antibodies than in other patients with systemic sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Calcinosis universalis presents with extensive areas of cutaneous calcification (essentially the formation of an &quot;exoskeleton&quot;) and significant functional impairment. The etiology is calcium salt deposition along fascial planes of skin and muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatomyositis </strong>&ndash; Calcinosis cutis is more common in juvenile dermatomyositis (44 to 70 percent) than classic dermatomyositis (11 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. Juvenile dermatomyositis also demonstrates a more rapid onset after the initial diagnosis.

The distribution favors sites of repeated trauma. Calcium deposits may be intracutaneous, subcutaneous, fascial, or intramuscular and can be painful.

Palpation is useful for identifying areas of involvement that are more easily felt than seen. The physical examination may also provide clues for the type of calcinosis cutis present based upon the morphology and distribution of involvement and the presence of other cutaneous and noncutaneous signs suggestive of an underlying disease.

Calcinosis cutis can be divided into five subtypes: dystrophic calcinosis cutis, metastatic calcinosis cutis, idiopathic calcinosis cutis, iatrogenic calcinosis cutis, and calciphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101583 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H589826887\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H369138846\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dystrophic calcinosis cutis is the most common form of calcinosis cutis. Dystrophic calcinosis cutis may occur in the setting of autoimmune connective tissue disease (most common), panniculitis, porphyria cutanea tarda, select genodermatoses, cutaneous neoplasms, trauma, and infection. The autoimmune connective tissues most likely to exhibit calcinosis cutis are systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis. (See <a href=\"#H589826893\" class=\"local\">'Dystrophic calcinosis cutis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastatic calcification occurs as a result of abnormal calcium or phosphate metabolism leading to precipitation of calcium and skin and subcutaneous tissue. Chronic renal failure is the most common cause of metastatic calcification. (See <a href=\"#H589827049\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic calcinosis cutis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic calcinosis cutis occurs in the absence of a detectable cause of tissue injury or metabolic disorder. Idiopathic calcification of the scrotum, subepidermal calcified nodule, and tumoral calcinosis are forms of idiopathic calcinosis cutis. (See <a href=\"#H589827079\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic calcinosis cutis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis is calcium deposition resulting from medical interventions. Extravasation of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a>, or phosphate-containing solutions is the most common cause of iatrogenic calcinosis cutis. (See <a href=\"#H589827103\" class=\"local\">'Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous manifestations of calciphylaxis result from calcium deposition in the walls of small and medium-sized blood vessels in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Calciphylaxis most frequently occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H589827109\" class=\"local\">'Calciphylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis vary widely. Patients may present with firm papules, nodules, or plaques that are skin-colored, white-yellow, or erythematous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101499%7EDERM%2F101500%7EDERM%2F101501%7EDERM%2F101502%7EDERM%2F101498%7EDERM%2F101503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101499 graphicRef101500 graphicRef101501 graphicRef101502 graphicRef101498 graphicRef101503 \">picture 1A-F</a>). Ulceration or extrusion of calcium may be present. Calciphylaxis usually presents with painful retiform purpura and ulceration. In some cases, calcinosis cutis is an incidental histologic or radiologic finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97989%7EDERM%2F101496\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97989 graphicRef101496 \">image 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H369138846\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of calcinosis cutis may be suspected based upon the patient history and physical examination. A skin biopsy confirms the diagnosis. An evaluation to determine the subtype, etiology, and extent of involvement is indicated for patients with calcinosis cutis.
