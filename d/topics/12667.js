It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are usually monoclonal in origin.</p><p>CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), one of the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the blood, whereas the term SLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal. While there is some difference to the treatment of early stage CLL and SLL, the treatment of advanced stage disease is the same. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>General issues regarding the treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> will be reviewed here.

This is principally because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLL is an extremely heterogeneous disease with certain subsets of patients having survival rates without treatment that are similar to the normal population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the possible exception of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), CLL cannot be cured by current treatment options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Low- and intermediate-risk groups'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective, randomized trials evaluating immediate versus delayed treatment strategies have found no improvement in long-term survival with early treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous regression of variable duration is a rare occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5621835\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic early stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among newly diagnosed patients with early stage asymptomatic CLL, the standard of care is observation rather than immediate treatment. In contrast, localized radiation therapy is usually offered to patients with localized (stage I) SLL. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of localized SLL'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach is supported by several prospective, randomized trials that have evaluated the treatment of early stage CLL. A meta-analysis of 2048 patients with asymptomatic Rai stage I or II or Binet stage A disease enrolled in six prospective, randomized trials of immediate versus delayed chlorambucil-based chemotherapy found no benefit with immediate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There was a nonsignificant trend towards decreased rates of 10-year overall survival with immediate treatment (44 versus 47 percent).</p><p>The development of newer agents with significant activity in CLL has resulted in much higher rates of complete remissions with therapy. As such, prospective, randomized trials of aggressive therapy with these newer agents in patients with early stage disease and poor-risk prognostic markers (eg, ZAP-70 positivity, 17p deletion, CD38 positivity, unmutated segments of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable [IGHV] genes) are underway. While we acknowledge that persons with asymptomatic CLL that displays poor-risk prognostic markers can have increased psychological stress that affects their emotional well-being and creates a push to start therapeutic interventions right away, there is no evidence that earlier treatment benefits the patient. Until studies demonstrate a benefit, early treatment of asymptomatic persons should be reserved for patients enrolled on these clinical trials. We do routinely perform FISH for del17p, del11q, trisomy 12, and del13q in asymptomatic patients at the time of diagnosis to predict time to progression. Other tests that may be considered for prognostic purposes include beta-2 microglobulin, testing for mutations in IGHV genes, and serum thymidine kinase. (See <a href=\"#H5625565\" class=\"local\">'Pre-treatment evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-genetic-features-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and genetic features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5621842\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic or advanced stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While highly variable, patients with asymptomatic early stage (Rai stage &lt;3, Binet stage A or B) CLL have a median survival greater than 10 years. In contrast, patients with more advanced stage CLL or those who demonstrate symptoms or progressive disease have a median survival without treatment between 18 months and three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Treatment of the underlying CLL is indicated for patients who develop disease-related symptoms or evidence of progressive disease, termed &quot;active disease.&quot; With therapy, median survival improves to approximately five to eight years.

Autoimmune mediated anemia or thrombocytopenia is treated with therapy directed at the autoimmune process before treatment of the underlying CLL is initiated.

However, in our experience, extreme lymphocytosis (leukocyte counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;200,000/microL)</span> is associated with an increased risk of hyperviscosity syndrome and related complications (eg, transient ischemic attack). Therefore, we have empirically used a threshold of leukocyte counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;200,000/microL</span> to offer therapy to otherwise asymptomatic patients with early stage CLL. </p><p>It is premature to use newer, adverse prognostic features (eg, ZAP-70, CD38, unmutated IGHV, genomic aberrations, gene mutations) as the basis for deciding when to initiate treatment, except in the context of prospective clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. At this time, we consider the patient's clinical presentation and course to be of greater weight and importance than the results of specific prognostic markers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical staging and prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5625291\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF CLL/SLL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of asymptomatic CLL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, immediate treatment is indicated in patients with active disease manifest as advanced stage disease, high tumor burden, severe disease-related &quot;B&quot; symptoms, or repeated infections. Otherwise, a period of observation is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>During the observation period, we perform blood counts at three-month intervals along with a clinical examination. At the end of 12 months, a clear decision as to whether the patient has aggressive disease can be made based upon these evaluations.</p><p>Of particular importance is the rate of increase in blood lymphocyte count and any evidence indicating emergence of progressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic disease. If the patient has a blood lymphocyte doubling time less than 12 months, survival is significantly shorter than in patients with longer doubling times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Some clinicians choose to offer treatment in this setting, although it is our preference not to treat based on the doubling time alone. In addition, the initial level of blood lymphocyte count should be considered. For example, a doubling of the white cell count from 10,000 to 20,000 in less than 12 months in an early stage patient who is free of symptoms does not have the same weight in deciding to initiate therapy as a rapid doubling of the white cell count from 75,000 to 150,000.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of localized SLL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with localized (stage I) SLL, we suggest treatment with involved-field radiation therapy alone rather than systemic chemotherapy or observation. Patients with stage II or more advanced SLL are usually treated with chemotherapy regimens used for symptomatic CLL as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of symptomatic CLL or advanced SLL'</a> below.)</p><p>Our preference for radiation therapy in patients with localized SLL is principally based upon retrospective analyses that have demonstrated prolonged freedom from relapse with localized radiation therapy alone and extrapolation of data from other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes. As an example, a retrospective series of 54 patients with SLL included 14 patients with stage I or II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among patients with stage I or stage II SLL treated with radiation therapy alone (40 to 44 Gy given as involved or extended-field), 10-year freedom from relapse rates were 80 and 62 percent, respectively.</p><p>Although there have been no prospective trials comparing radiation therapy to chemotherapy or observation in patients with early stage SLL, such studies have been performed in patients with other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes and found localized radiation therapy to be superior to the other options. These trials are described in detail separately.

With the possible exception of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, CLL cannot be cured by current treatment options.

IGHV mutation status may be performed, as the mutated IGHV status has been associated with prolonged survival after FCR treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

There are several initial treatment options; most have not been directly compared with each other. While overall survival rates with the different regimens may be similar, they differ in their rates of complete remission, time to progression, and associated toxicities. A choice from among these therapies is made based upon patient characteristics and goals of therapy.

If patients are tolerating and responding to treatment, it appears reasonable to continue therapy until one of the following endpoints has been reached:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete remission (CR) has been obtained</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continued improvement is no longer noted</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unacceptable degree of toxicity develops</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prespecified number of cycles (eg, six) has been administered</p><p/><p>While most experience has been obtained with the use of purine analogs given as six monthly courses, many patients receiving these treatments as initial therapy achieve CR after two to three courses. For patients treated off protocol, we evaluate the response with a clinical examination and blood work prior to each scheduled chemotherapy cycle. If this evaluation demonstrates a continued beneficial response compared with the preceding cycle without unacceptable levels of toxicity, we continue with the planned chemotherapy cycle. If, on the other hand, we see a plateau in the response level compared with the prior cycle, we discontinue treatment. This way we stop at the maximum achievable response and avoid any unnecessary toxicity.

CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CLL is an extremely heterogeneous disease and most patients have early stage disease at the time of diagnosis. Therapy is indicated for patients with &quot;active disease&quot; as manifested by advanced stage, high tumor burden, severe disease-related &quot;B&quot; symptoms, or repeated infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96185 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with newly diagnosed early stage asymptomatic CLL, we recommend observation rather than immediate treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Management of asymptomatic CLL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with localized (stage I and possibly II) SLL, we suggest treatment with involved-field radiation therapy alone rather than systemic chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients with more advanced SLL are treated with chemotherapy regimens used for symptomatic CLL (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of localized SLL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to the initiation of therapy for patients with symptomatic disease, patients with CLL should undergo a pre-treatment evaluation to determine the extent of disease, patient performance status, and assessment of comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. Testing for del17p and TP53 mutations to identify high risk disease is a critical part of the pretreatment evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H5625565\" class=\"local\">'Pre-treatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no single agreed-upon standard front-line treatment regimen for all symptomatic CLL or advanced SLL patients, mostly due to differences in patient age and fitness. There are several initial treatment options and most have not been directly compared. While overall survival rates with the different available regimens are similar, they differ in their rates of complete remission, time to progression, and associated toxicities. A choice between these therapies is made based upon patient and disease characteristics as well as the goals of care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-therapy-for-symptomatic-or-advanced-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial therapy for symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are evaluated periodically to determine the response to treatment. The specific evaluation used varies depending upon whether the patient is enrolled in a clinical trial or is being treated off protocol. Reasonable effort should be made to determine the disease status at relevant sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals and duration of therapy for CLL are poorly defined, and there is no evidence that intensification or maintenance therapy is of benefit. Although there is little evidence for a particular number of cycles, most regimens are administered to a prespecified number of cycles as long as the patient is tolerating and responding to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1603410\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate would like to acknowledge Michael J Keating, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Effects of chlorambucil and therapeutic decision in initial forms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (stage A): results of a randomized clinical trial on 612 patients.
