There have been descriptions of patients with disorders that would now be considered CIDP for over 75 years, and the landmark report of Austin in 1958 described two patients with relapsing disease and glucocorticoid response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The concept of CIDP as a distinct entity was introduced in 1975 when a review of the clinical, electrodiagnostic, and pathologic findings of 53 patients was presented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While that publication did not include &quot;demyelinating&quot; in the title, subsequent reports have included it, and demyelination is now recognized as a cardinal feature of the disorder.</p><p>The classification, etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of CIDP will be reviewed here. Treatment and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately.

As an example, some patients with CIDP have a subacute onset resembling that seen in GBS, and CIDP is recognized only after relapses or progression occur over the ensuing few months.</p><p>In addition to chronicity, other features may be useful to distinguish GBS (including AIDP) from CIDP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of GBS is usually easily identified, while the precise onset of CIDP is typically less clear.

Approximately 70 percent of AIDP cases are preceded by an infectious illness, vaccination, or surgery by three to four weeks prior to the onset of clinical symptoms.

Both the cellular and humoral components of the immune system appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of CIDP and its variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellular immunity involvement is supported by evidence of T-cell activation, crossing of the blood-nerve barrier by activated T-cells, and by expression of cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, interferons, and interleukins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humoral immunity is implicated by the demonstration of immunoglobulin and complement deposition on myelinated nerve fibers, and by passive transfer experiments that induce conduction block and demyelination by injecting serum or purified IgG from CIDP patients into rats.</p><p/><p>The immunologic cause(s) of most forms of CIDP remain unclear, since specific provoking antigens have not previously been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, antibodies to different isoforms of neurofascin or to contactin have been detected in small numbers of patients with CIDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Neurofascin and contactin are critical structural elements of the paranodal loop attachment to the axolemma. The antibodies identified are in the IgG4 subclass. These antibodies appear to target paranodal proteins and may disrupt the axonal-glial junctions, leading to nerve conduction slowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

CIDP can affect all ages but is more common in older males. It is thought that the disease is more likely to be progressive in the older age group and relapsing-remitting in younger patients.</p><p>No specific predisposing factors for CIDP have been identified. There have been conflicting studies on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type associations, but no clear genetic predisposition has been found. In several case reports, treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors has been associated with the subsequent development of chronic demyelinating neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial description of CIDP in 1975 pointed out the major cardinal features of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The classic form of CIDP is fairly symmetric and motor involvement is greater than sensory. Weakness is present in both proximal and distal muscles, and this pattern is a hallmark of acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cranial nerve and bulbar involvement occur in 10 to 20 percent of patients. Tremor has been reported as a common symptom in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>Most patients with CIDP also have sensory involvement and globally diminished or absent reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. Sensory impairment in CIDP is usually greater for vibration and position sense than for pain and temperature sense, reflecting the involvement of larger myelinated fibers. Unlike the motor involvement, the sensory involvement tends to follow a distal to proximal gradient, although finger involvement is frequently seen as early as toe and foot involvement. Painful dysesthesias can occur. Back pain may also be present. Symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis and cauda equina syndrome can occur rarely if there is marked nerve root hypertrophy, and these problems may require surgical intervention.</p><p>Autonomic involvement in CIDP is generally mild and limited in distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Constipation and urinary retention are not usually early symptoms of CIDP, but may occur in more severe cases. </p><p>Most patients with CIDP exhibit a slowly progressive course, but a relapsing-remitting course is noted in at least one-third, and may be more common in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The advent of early treatment for CIDP has made the temporal progression of the disease more difficult to characterize, since remissions may be related to therapy rather than to the natural course of the disease.

However, other focal or generalized nerve diseases (eg, diabetic neuropathy) can also result in slow conduction velocities or apparent block in neural conduction. It may be difficult to determine conduction slowing in patients who have severe axonal loss. Evaluating nerves that supply more proximal and less severely denervated muscles may be helpful in finding the conduction abnormalities. As already mentioned, various sets of electrodiagnostic criteria for demyelinating neuropathy have been established to address this problem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71475 \">table 1</a>).

CIDP is a multifocal disorder, and motor nerve fibers tend to be more affected than sensory nerves (the usual nerves used for biopsy). As a result, the biopsy sample may not demonstrate the demyelination. In addition, the inflammatory component of CIDP may not be prominent and thus may not be apparent on biopsy.</p><p>Despite these drawbacks, nerve biopsy can provide solid evidence of demyelination. In addition, biopsy occasionally reveals other neuropathies that mimic CIDP, such as those due to amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], sarcoidosis, and vasculitis.

However, care should be taken to choose a nerve that has either electrophysiologic or clinical evidence of functionality, as completely devastated nerves usually convey limited information.

In contrast, axonal polyneuropathies are characterized by predominantly distal weakness. Furthermore, deep tendon reflexes are globally reduced or absent in CIDP, whereas only the ankle reflexes are diminished in typical axonal polyneuropathies. The features of CIDP point to the multifocal or generalized nature of the disease even at early stages of the illness.</p><p>To confirm the diagnosis of CIDP, the clinician must be sure that the patient has a clinical picture that is consistent with the diagnosis and that the electrophysiology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other studies (cerebrospinal fluid analysis, nerve biopsy, MRI) have features suggesting a demyelinating neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain genetic disorders of peripheral nerve myelin have characteristics that can mimic the clinical or electrodiagnostic features of CIDP or its variants.

Whether CIDP is a disease or a syndrome remains controversial. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a temporal continuum between acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), the demyelinating form of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, and CIDP. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Temporal continuum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both the cellular and humoral components of the immune system appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of CIDP and its variants. The precise cause is unclear in most cases. However, the findings of antibodies directed against neurofascin and contactin in some severe cases of CIDP may shed new light on the pathophysiology of CIDP. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic form of CIDP is fairly symmetric and motor involvement is greater than sensory. Weakness is present in both proximal and distal muscles. Most patients also have sensory involvement and globally diminished or absent reflexes. Sensory impairment in CIDP is usually greater for vibration and position sense than for pain and temperature sense. Cranial nerve and bulbar involvement occur in a minority. Most patients have a slowly progressive course, but a relapsing-remitting course is noted in at least one-third. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major clinical variants of CIDP include (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Variants of CIDP'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), also known as Lewis-Sumner syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A sensory-predominant form of CIDP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distal acquired demyelinating symmetric neuropathy (DADS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CIDP should be considered in patients with symmetric or asymmetric polyneuropathy who have a progressive or relapsing-remitting clinical course for more than two months, particularly if the clinical features include positive sensory symptoms, proximal weakness, or areflexia. While the initial diagnosis of CIDP is clinical, the diagnosis is confirmed by evidence of peripheral nerve demyelination, which must be demonstrated by either electrodiagnostic findings or by nerve biopsy. Patients with atypical features or diagnostic uncertainty should be referred to a neuromuscular specialist with expertise in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following general criteria support the diagnosis of the classic form of CIDP (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progression over at least two months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weakness more than sensory symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symmetric involvement of arms and legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proximal muscles involved along with distal muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced deep tendon reflexes throughout</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein without pleocytosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nerve conduction evidence of a demyelinating neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nerve biopsy evidence of segmental demyelination with or without inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid misdiagnosis, we suggest utilizing one of the published sets of diagnostic criteria for CIDP; we prefer the European Federation of Neurological Societies and the Peripheral Nerve Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(EFNS/PNS)</span> criteria for this purpose.
