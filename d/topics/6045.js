Endometriosis lesions can be superficial, ovarian, or deep. Endometriosis lesions that invade into the rectovaginal space <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bowel are forms of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). The invasive nature of these implants causes significant pain, bowel dysfunction, and treatment challenges.</p><p>This topic will review the medical and surgical treatment of rectovaginal and bowel endometriosis. General principles of endometriosis, the presentation of rectovaginal and bowel endometriosis, and urinary tract endometriosis (another form of DIE) are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rectovaginal-or-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rectovaginal or bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis of the bladder and ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875733257\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In creating a treatment plan, the clinician and patient must consider the patient's symptoms, the anatomic location of disease, and the risks and benefits of both medical and surgical therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H796340327\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of bowel or rectovaginal disease is indicated if characteristic symptoms are present (deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, cyclic rectal bleeding) <strong>and</strong> rectovaginal endometriosis is identified on evaluation. Treatment of bowel endometriosis is indicated for nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, rectal bleeding, constipation, bloating) <strong>only</strong> if other etiologies of these symptoms have been excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rectovaginal-or-bowel-disease#H3390061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rectovaginal or bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Urgent treatment is indicated in the rare instances in which a woman presents with bowel or ureteral obstruction. In contrast, women who are asymptomatic or who have mild symptoms that are not bothersome are managed expectantly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3857670716\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic location of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bowel endometriosis can be thought of as two different entities depending upon anatomic location: (1) rectovaginal endometriosis and (2) involvement of the bowel wall proximal to the rectosigmoid colon. The surgical treatments, and the risks and complications, differ for these two locations. As an example, women with rectovaginal nodules that require an ultra-low rectal anastomosis (distance from the lower margin of resected segment from the anal verge &lt;5 cm) have a higher risk of postoperative anastomotic leakage and may require protective temporary <span class=\"nowrap\">colostomy/ileostomy</span>. In contrast, primary anastomosis is typically performed following resection of bowel lesions that are more than 5 cm from the anal verge. Both rectovaginal and bowel endometriosis typically coexist with other sites of disease. Thus, to appropriately counsel a woman regarding her treatment options, the clinician must discuss the full distribution of lesions and the clinical implications of the location of those lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rectovaginal-or-bowel-disease#H543262355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rectovaginal or bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2820450396\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of medical or surgical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main therapeutic options for symptomatic rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis are systemic medical therapy or surgical treatment. While both therapies can be effective, the risk profiles differ. Choosing a treatment plan is based as much on risk tolerance and patient goals as it is on treatment efficacy.</p><p>Trials directly comparing medical with surgical treatment for rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis are lacking, and thus the optimal treatment is not known. In observational studies, the overall rates of improvement in pain symptoms are 70 percent or higher for either medical or surgical treatment, but these studies do not give information about severity of disease, and most do not provide long-term data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Unfortunately, there are few data regarding the effectiveness of medical therapy in treating pelvic pain specifically in women with rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis, and there is only one study on relief of gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the effectiveness of medical therapy for general pelvic endometriosis-related pain is well established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Medical treatment options'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical therapy</strong> &ndash; Advantages of medical therapy include that it treats all sites of disease simultaneously, can have ancillary benefits (eg, provide birth control), is generally well tolerated, and has relatively few side effects. In addition, medical treatment of rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis avoids the risks associated with surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1034465873\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The disadvantages of medical therapy are that it must be continued until menopause (when endometriosis typically regresses), it is not effective in all women, it may take longer to achieve an effect, and discontinuation can result in symptoms recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. In addition, women who are trying to conceive must stop hormonal medications since they interfere with ovulation and are potentially teratogenic. In a cohort study of women with deep dyspareunia from deeply infiltrating endometriosis (urinary and rectovaginal), nearly one-third of women had an inadequate response to medical therapy and required surgical management (although 60 percent of women treated medically were satisfied) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, this study reported that women who received medical treatment with progestin therapy had a more gradual response compared with women who underwent surgery, although the measured treatment outcomes (frequency of intercourse per month and treatment satisfaction) were the same at 12 months for women with rectovaginal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical therapy</strong> &ndash; Surgical therapy provides treatment that is directly correlated to patient symptoms, provides long-term pain relief, and is associated with improved quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. In a prospective cohort study of nearly 250 women followed for two years after surgical resection of endometriosis from the rectovaginal septum, only 4 percent of women reported pain and 1 percent reported dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The major disadvantages include morbidity, surgical complication, and potential bowel dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H1034465873\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2811822835\" class=\"local\">'Long-term bowel dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2534370197\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consistent with statements from international committees, our approach is to maximize medical therapy and minimize surgical intervention, particularly repeat surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Management of rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis is aimed at resolving symptoms; thus, we offer all women empiric treatment with regularly scheduled office visits, a bowel regimen (such as with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a>), and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)'</a>.)</p><p>For women who require additional treatment, we initially offer hormone-based medical therapy because it is effective in more than half of women and avoids the risk of surgical complications, such as genital tract fistulae, bladder dysfunction, or bowel anastomotic leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Surgery is a reasonable choice for women who are willing to accept the risks of surgery and who prefer to avoid chronic medical therapy, women who have failed medical therapy, or women who cannot receive medical therapy. Asymptomatic women can be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Exceptions to this approach include women with bowel or ureteral obstruction. These women require immediate surgical correction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Medical treatment options'</a> and <a href=\"#H1034465873\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter#H64223165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis of the bladder and ureter&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p>While it is generally accepted that women with a rectovaginal nodule are more likely to achieve complete relief of symptoms (deep dyspareunia, dyschezia) following surgical treatment than with medical therapy, in our opinion, this benefit is not outweighed by the high risk of major postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, this approach is somewhat surgeon-dependent. As an example, a review of 122 studies concluded that women with significant pain (as defined by a visual analogue score &ge;7) benefited from proceeding directly with surgery and created a surgical treatment algorithm based on the depth and size of rectal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110998\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110998 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, many women with endometriosis undergo several surgeries, and the risk of surgical complications increases with repeat procedures due to multiple exposures to surgical risk and development of scar tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1786226053\" class=\"local\">'Medical treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H47883691\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Of note, neither surgical nor pharmacologic therapy for rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis is effective for the treatment of infertility. For women with endometriosis and infertility, we offer treatments focused on resolving the infertility, including surgical removal of endometriosis at other anatomic sites with restoration of normal anatomy or assisted reproduction techniques. (See <a href=\"#H3124095844\" class=\"local\">'Infertility'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1786226053\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for medical therapy include estrogen-progestin or progestin-only hormonal treatment, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, and aromatase inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3904998979\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical therapy for rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis appears to be effective in many women, but it requires further study to understand the subgroups of women who benefit most. Available studies report a promising effect on pain symptoms, with 60 to 90 percent of patients noting considerable improvement or complete relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/2-6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6,8</a>].</p><p>The limitations of the studies to date are that they have been conducted almost exclusively in women with rectovaginal disease who have recurrent or persistent symptoms following conservative surgery (uterus and ovaries were not removed). The efficacy rate for primary medical treatment of rectovaginal or bowel disease is not known because women whose symptoms are adequately managed medically do not proceed with further evaluation or surgery to diagnose and treat intestinal disease. In addition, as surgical treatment encompasses both conservative and definitive surgery (removal of endometriosis only versus removal of endometriosis plus uterus and ovaries), it is not clear as to which surgery medical therapy should be compared with when assessing efficacy. Lastly, more data are needed regarding the efficacy of medical treatment of lesions beyond the rectum and on women with gastrointestinal, rather than pelvic, symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain#H13645162\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Conservative versus definitive surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Some experts have postulated that medical therapy would be less effective because it treats the lesion but not the surrounding fibrosis. Such fibrosis almost always accompanies deep endometriosis and likely contributes to pain, and certainly to bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On the other hand, medical treatment likely results in reduced stimulation of pain fibers by decreasing intra- and perilesional inflammation and production of prostaglandins and cytokines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3925734478\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogens and progestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of progestin-only and estrogen-progestin treatments have reported both reduction and resolution of pain symptoms associated with rectovaginal endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/3,4,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,17-19</a>]. In our practice, we use progestin alone as a first-line treatment (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate 2.5 mg per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, as both the combined estrogen-progestin and progestin-alone regimens have been associated with reduced symptoms, treatment with a combined hormonal contraceptive is a reasonable option. In a trial of 90 women with rectovaginal endometriosis comparing estrogen-progestin therapy with norethindrone acetate treatment, both groups reported a substantial reduction in dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, and dyschezia at 12 months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The optimal hormonal combinations or routes of treatment to reduce symptoms of rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis are not known. In a prospective study of 59 women with rectovaginal endometriosis that compared treatment with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-vaginal-ring-ethinyl-estradiol-and-etonogestrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">contraceptive vaginal ring</a> (15 micrograms ethinyl <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> and 120 micrograms etonogestrel per day) with the patch (20 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and 150 micrograms norelgestromin per day), the ring was associated with a significantly greater improvement in dysmenorrhea, while improvement in dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain was similar for the two preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A different study of nearly 150 women with rectovaginal endometriosis who elected treatment with a desogestrel-only pill or the vaginal ring reported similar outcomes for reduction of lesion volume, discontinuation of therapy, and subsequent surgery, but patient satisfaction was higher for the pill than the ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lastly, a small study (n = 11) reported that the use of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel intrauterine device</a> was associated with improvement in dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and dyschezia in women with rectovaginal endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, selection of hormonal product (estrogen-progestin or progestin-only) and route of delivery (pill, patch, ring, injection, implant, or intrauterine device) depends largely on patient preferences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Relief of gastrointestinal symptoms of bowel endometriosis with medical therapy has not been well studied. In a prospective study of 40 women with rectosigmoid endometriosis who were still symptomatic following surgery and were treated with norethisterone (2.5 mg per day) reported treatment was associated with significant improvements in diarrhea, intestinal cramping, passage of mucus with stool, and cyclic rectal bleeding at 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Constipation was improved only in women who had cyclic symptoms. No significant improvement was reported for abdominal bloating or the feeling of incomplete evacuation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155197548\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis with hormonal medications other than estrogen and progestins have been investigated in limited studies. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, and aromatase inhibitors (AI) have each been evaluated in one study and reported to improve symptoms in women with rectovaginal endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/6,7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,23</a>]. However, long-term use of these agents is generally avoided since GnRH agonists and AI result in menopausal symptoms and a decrease in bone density, and danazol treatment is associated with androgenic side effects (danazol does not decrease bone density).

Progressive disease resulting in bowel obstruction has not been reported.</p><p>In our practice, we follow patients on medical therapy with physical examination and imaging.

Surgical treatment of rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis is guided by the location, size, and depth of infiltration of the endometriotic lesions. When surgery for the removal of bowel disease is chosen, we remove all sites of endometriosis found throughout the pelvis. Surgery is typically performed with laparoscopy, but laparotomy can be required depending upon the anatomic site of disease, the complexity of the procedure, and the surgeon's laparoscopic skills. Successful treatment of symptoms appears to depend upon surgical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Patient counseling involves a careful discussion of the risks of bowel resection if such surgery necessary to fully remove the endometriosis lesions. We specifically discuss the potential need for a temporary <span class=\"nowrap\">colostomy/ileostomy</span> in cases of very low nodules and the risks of anastomotic leak requiring reoperation and possible temporary <span class=\"nowrap\">colostomy/ileostomy,</span> rectovaginal fistula, postoperative ileus or obstruction, and pelvic abscess. Rectal resection is complicated by rectovaginal fistula in up to 10 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. If rectal wall infiltration is suspected, the surgeon should discuss the potential for this complication with the patient and explain the treatment that fistula formation can require. Many women prefer to live with residual dyschezia than to risk a vaginal passage of feces or a colostomy. In order to reduce the risk of rectovaginal fistula formation, some surgeons perform a temporary preventive ileostomy at first-line surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

In our practice, we ask women to consume a fiber-free diet for three days prior to surgery and to drink 3 to 4 liters of polyethylene glycol solution the night prior to surgery. However, this approach is not universal.</p><p>Thromboprophylaxis and antibiotic prophylaxis is the same as for women undergoing surgery for general endometriosis.

Conservative surgical treatment consists of excising the symptomatic endometriotic lesions, while leaving surrounding structures intact. For endometriosis in general, definitive surgery includes hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with removal of symptomatic lesions at other sites (eg, peritoneum, bowel). In our practice, definitive surgery is typically reserved for women who have failed medical and conservative surgical treatment because of the associated morbidity of hormone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

If infiltration of the rectal or vaginal walls is present, resection and repair of these structures may be required. In addition, as rectovaginal disease is often associated with obliteration of the posterior cul-de-sac or with lesions of the uterosacral ligaments, these sites may require posterior cul-de-sac adhesiolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ablation or resection of the uterosacral ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1209537087\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgical procedure is typically performed laparoscopically. The basic steps for surgical treatment of rectovaginal disease are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Explore and delineate the posterior pelvic anatomy</strong> &ndash; The surgeon explores the accessible portion of the pelvic posterior cul-de-sac, identifies the ureters bilaterally, and develops the pararectal spaces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissect the rectum off the posterior vaginal fornix</strong> &ndash; To identify the vaginal apex, the surgeon inserts examining fingers or an instrument, such as an end-to-end anastomosis sizer, into the vagina to elevate the posterior vaginal fornix and the rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50155 \">figure 1</a>). The surgeon's other hand or an instrument is used from within the pelvis to dissect the rectum from the posterior aspect of the uterus and posterior vaginal wall. This technique allows the surgeon to use both visual and tactile information to ensure a precise plane of dissection, thereby minimizing the risk of bowel injury. We use cold scissors in order to avoid thermal injury to the rectum and use selective bipolar coagulation to control bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Open the vaginal fornix</strong> &ndash; The posterior vaginal wall is then grasped, typically using delicate laparoscopic grasping forceps, at each corner. This allows direct inspection of the endometriotic lesion and a precise estimate of the need for further rectal detachment. Dissection of the para-rectal space may be necessary to visualize the lesion and its depth of invasion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excise the endometriotic lesions</strong> &ndash; We dissect the adjacent normal tissue off the lesion. Once free margins around the lesion are reached both laterally and caudally, the endometriotic plaque is excised. This may require removal of part of the vaginal wall to completely remove the endometriotic lesion. If the lesion is not completely excised, symptoms are likely to persist. Resection of the lesion is usually performed using a V-shaped incision that follows the original shape of the lower posterior cul-de-sac.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess the anterior rectal wall</strong> &ndash; In the presence of kinking, stenosis, or infiltration of the rectal wall by the endometriotic nodule, an intraoperative consultation from a bowel surgeon is required to determine the treatment approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reattach the vagina to the cervix</strong> &ndash; In our practice, we use a&nbsp;T-shaped suture (ie, a short vertical suture of the caudal portion of the vaginal incision), followed by a transverse suture of the posterior vaginal wall to the cervix, using 3-0 polyglactin (Vicryl) sutures. During a laparoscopic procedure, this step is performed vaginally.</p><p/><p>In contrast to the above approach, some surgeons perform a low anterior rectal resection with primary repair. In our practice, we limit colorectal resection in women with rectovaginal disease to two clinical situations: (1) those with nodules requiring extensive opening of the rectum, for which suturing may result in iatrogenic stenosis and (2) those with fibrotic and unhealthy tissue margins at increased risk of suture dehiscence.</p><p>This approach is supported by studies reporting that rectal shaving reduces pain and rectal segmental resection does not appear to offer better pain control than nodule excision and may result in adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and higher complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>]. In a retrospective study of women who underwent either colorectal resection (25 women) or nodule excision (16 women) and were followed over an average of 26 months, pain improvement was similar for the two groups but the women who underwent segmental resection were more likely to develop frequent stools, defined as &ge;3 per day (52 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a different retrospective study of 77 women with deeply infiltrating lesions of the rectum, women who underwent lesion shaving, compared with women who underwent colorectal resection, reported better Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index values, lower Knowles Eccersley Scott Symptom scores for postoperative constipation, and improved anal continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While 9 percent of women managed with rectal shaving experienced a rectal recurrence, an additional 11 women would have had to undergo colorectal resection rather than lesion shaving to avoid one recurrence. Limitations of these studies include the small number of included women and the lack of randomly assigned trial design.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1084193023\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following resection of rectovaginal endometriosis, we advise patients to avoid sexual intercourse for eight weeks. We see patients for a routine follow-up visit approximately six weeks postoperatively. Instructions for patients following gynecologic surgery can be found separately.

There are no universal guidelines as to which excision technique is optimal and the surgical management of bowel endometriosis is a point of clinical controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Given the available data, we perform the smallest resection required to excise the lesion.</p><p>The extent of resection depends upon the lesion's depth of infiltration and size, as well as the surgeon's preference. Techniques include bowel resection or nodule excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Methods of nodule excision include bowel shaving (without opening the bowel wall) or discoid resection (ie, removing the nodule and surrounding rectal wall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The integrity of the bowel must be assessed after <span class=\"nowrap\">shaving/superficial</span> excision is performed. Damage to the bowel muscularis requires repair or resection of the damaged area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discoid full thickness bowel excision and repair &ndash; The lesion and full thickness of the surrounding bowel wall are excised. The bowel wall is then closed with manual suture in two layers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmental bowel resection and anastomosis &ndash; The lesion and bowel segment are resected, followed by bowel anastomosis. Indications for bowel resection include stenosis, multifocal lesions, sigmoid involvement, and lesions &gt;3 cm or involving more than 50 percent of the bowel wall circumference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Consistent with the anatomic distribution of the disease, over 90 percent of segmental bowel resections performed in women with endometriosis are of the rectosigmoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rectovaginal-or-bowel-disease#H1747683076\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rectovaginal or bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Distribution of disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p>There are limited data to guide the choice of resection technique and the comparative studies are not randomly assigned trials. When choosing a surgical approach, issues to consider include efficacy of pain relief, risk of repeat surgery, and risk of complication. Retrospective studies suggest that complete pain relief and avoidance of a repeat endometriosis surgery is more likely in women who undergo segmental or discoid resection compared with shaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. However, complication rates appear to increase with the extent of resection, but the data are not consistent. In a systematic review of surgical treatment of deep colorectal endometriosis that included 49 studies with nearly 3900 women, the majority of patients underwent segmental bowel resection and anastomosis (71 percent), followed by <span class=\"nowrap\">shaving/superficial</span> procedures (17 percent) and discoid excision (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, complete excision may be difficult to determine with gross visualization. In a systematic review of women who underwent bowel resection for colorectal endometriosis, six studies reported that 20 percent of specimens had margins that were positive for endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2190026824\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidental bowel endometriosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rectovaginal disease is more commonly diagnosed preoperatively than disease of other bowel sites. Rectovaginal disease typically presents with characteristic symptoms (eg, dyschezia) and a presumptive diagnosis can be made preoperatively with physical examination and imaging that identify rectovaginal endometriosis lesions. In contrast, bowel lesions beyond the rectosigmoid junction are associated with nonspecific symptoms. These lesions are typically found incidentally during diagnostic laparoscopy for pelvic pain or infertility and can be confirmed with biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rectovaginal-or-bowel-disease#H1844428407\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rectovaginal or bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we do not biopsy all bowel lesions that are discovered incidentally. For such lesions, we remove only those that are small in diameter (&lt;2 cm) and that can be removed without entering the bowel muscularis or lumen. Removal of lesions that require bowel wall excision or bowel resection is performed only in patients who have been counseled about the procedure, have given informed consent, and have undergone a proper preoperative bowel preparation. For this reason, some women with bowel endometriosis have a two-stage procedure: one surgery for diagnosis and another for treatment. A systematic review of surgical treatment for colorectal endometriosis reported that nearly 60 percent of women had undergone a previous surgery for endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, a careful preoperative evaluation should limit the frequency of this two-procedure approach.</p><p>For women who require surgical treatment of endometriosis and who do not have bowel symptoms, we treat other sites first and do not ablate or remove bowel disease as part of a primary procedure. This approach is usually successful at relieving general symptoms of endometriosis (pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, infertility). It also avoids the potentially morbid extensive pelvic dissection or bowel resection required for surgical treatment of rectovaginal or bowel endometriosis. If symptoms persist, surgical treatment of bowel disease may be performed as a follow-up procedure.

The complications of these procedures are the same as for other pelvic dissection or bowel resection procedures.</p><p>In a literature review of 36 primarily retrospective studies, surgical treatment of rectovaginal endometriosis was associated with major complications in 3 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Urinary retention was the most frequently reported complication, possibly due to denervation of the bladder. Bladder dysfunction was found mostly, but not exclusively, in women who underwent colorectal resection. Rectovaginal fistula was reported in up to 10 percent of women. The same review evaluated 49 studies of surgical treatment of colorectal endometriosis and reported complications associated with bowel resection and anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In studies of bowel resection only, the complication rates in order of frequency were rectovaginal fistula (2.7 percent), anastomotic leakage (1.5 percent), and abscess (0.3 percent). Summary data were not given for less extensive resection of bowel lesions. However, a different systematic review of 30 studies on the complications of bowel resection for endometriosis reported an overall complication rate of 22.2 percent and a severe intestinal complication rate of 6.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H842215135\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H814841344\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical treatment results in improvement of pain symptoms, based upon consistent results from retrospective case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease/abstract/10,28,29,37,44,46-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28,29,37,44,46-58</a>].

Treatment of bowel or rectovaginal disease is indicated if characteristic symptoms are present (deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, cyclic rectal bleeding) <strong>and</strong> rectovaginal endometriosis is identified on evaluation. Treatment of bowel endometriosis is indicated for nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, rectal bleeding, constipation, bloating) <strong>only</strong> if other etiologies of these symptoms have been excluded.

Additionally, hormone-based medical therapy is effective in more than half of women.

(See <a href=\"#H454377578\" class=\"local\">'Rectovaginal endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bowel endometriosis at sites other than the rectosigmoid is treated surgically by excising the lesion. Techniques include bowel resection or nodule excision. Retrospective studies suggest that complete pain relief is more likely in women who undergo segmental or discoid resection compared with nodule excision but complication rates appear to increase with increasing extent of resection. (See <a href=\"#H2377343604\" class=\"local\">'Bowel endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment of rectovaginal endometriosis is associated with major complications in 3 to 10 percent of patients. Long-term outcomes include recurrence of pain, bowel dysfunction, and need for repeat surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1034465873\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H842215135\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who do not desire immediate pregnancy, postoperative medical therapy to suppress endometriosis is generally advised, although supporting data are limited. Women who desire pregnancy receive appropriate counseling and treatment to achieve pregnancy as soon as possible.
