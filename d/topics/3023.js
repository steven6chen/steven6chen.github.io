The majority (70 to 80 percent) of thrombotic events occurring in the superficial and deep veins of the upper extremity are due to the presence of intravenous catheters. The remainder are due to mechanical compression from anatomic abnormalities (ie, venous thoracic outlet syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Superficial thrombophlebitis due to peripheral catheters is generally self-limited once the catheter is removed. Thrombosis involving the deep veins (ie, subclavian, axillary, brachial) can lead to pulmonary embolism and long-term sequelae in spite of adequate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pulmonary embolism from upper extremity sources accounts for approximately 6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Upper extremity venous thrombosis (superficial and deep) as a complication of indwelling venous catheters will be reviewed here.

One retrospective study from a single institution estimated the frequency of thromboembolic disease of the brachiocephalic vein or superior vena cava due to central catheters to be 6 per 10,000 hospital admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) reduce the incidence of pneumothorax, they appear to have an incidence of upper extremity venous thrombosis similar to that of centrally inserted catheters, ranging from 3 to 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In a study of postoperative general surgical patients, 58 percent of deep vein thromboses occurred in the upper extremity, all but one of which was catheter related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The most common site of deep vein thrombosis for centrally placed catheters is the internal jugular vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For PICC catheters, the brachial, axillary, or subclavian veins may be involved. Thus, great caution should be used when considering intravenous access options in patients who may require hemodialysis access in the future due to the relatively high incidence of PICC-associated venous thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H85798006\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral versus central insertion'</a> below.)</p><p>The highest reported incidences of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) are from studies that screen for thrombus in patients with central catheters (asymptomatic and symptomatic), particularly those with cancer. In one retrospective review, ultrasound confirmed the presence of UEDVT in 60 percent of patients screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another prospective study in patients with malignancy found that 75 percent of patients identified with UEDVT were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any intravenous catheter has the potential to cause venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These include peripheral intravenous catheters, PICCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], tunneled and nontunneled central catheters port devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], and pacemakers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Multivariate logistic regression found an increased risk for CRT with the use of PICCs, previous history of deep vein thrombosis, subclavian venipuncture insertion site, and improper positioning of the catheter tip. There was also a lower risk of catheter-related thrombosis for implanted ports compared with PICC catheters (odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a review of over 50,000 port devices, the overall risk for port-related venous deep venous thrombosis was similarly low at 1.8 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85797994\"><span class=\"h4\">Catheter diameter/number of lumens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diameter of the catheter relative to the size of the vein determines whether or not blood will flow freely around the catheter or stagnate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. For a vein of similar size, thrombosis is more likely with a large-diameter, centrally placed catheter (eg, plasmapheresis, dialysis, multilumen catheters) compared with a small-diameter catheter (eg, single lumen). As an example, in one study involving PICC catheters of varying diameters, 5-French and 6-French PICCs were significantly more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis compared with 4-French PICCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85798006\"><span class=\"h4\">Peripheral versus central insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PICCs appear to be associated with a greater risk for venous thrombosis overall (superficial and deep thrombosis) compared with centrally inserted catheters (CICCs), including those attached to a port, particularly in those who are critically ill or who have malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/12,13,23,27-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,23,27-36</a>]. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis for PICCs is between 5 and 15 percent for hospitalized patients and 2 to 5 percent for ambulatory patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85798025\"><span class=\"h4\">Catheter malposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following placement of central catheters, the position of the catheter tip is typically confirmed with plain chest radiography.

These findings are more obvious when a superficial vein is affected. Obstruction of upper extremity flow may cause congestion of the collateral veins of the shoulder and chest wall on the affected side. The patient may or may not take notice of the venous patterning that results.</p><p>Thrombosis of the deep veins can be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms. A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis, and some cases go unrecognized, especially in patients with a variety of other major medical problems. This may partially account for the wide variation in reported incidence of this disorder, and it underscores the need for careful clinical surveillance of patients with central venous catheters.

These thrombi range from nonocclusive mural thrombi to thrombi large enough to totally occlude the subclavian veins bilaterally.

The mechanism of the obstruction is either thrombotic or mechanical (eg, kink in the catheter tubing, tight suture, catheter tip positioned against vessel wall, precipitation of infused drugs or lipid residues). Mechanical problems account for 40 percent of catheter occlusions, while thrombi account for the remainder.</p><p>Differentiating these two mechanisms is not possible solely on clinical grounds, and radiographic evaluation by plain film (to detect overt malposition) or injection of contrast material into the catheter is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Inability to infuse through a catheter is virtually always mechanical and is usually due to a tight anchoring suture or a subcutaneous kink.</p><p>Occluding thrombus usually does not originate in the lumen of the catheter but rather begins as a &quot;fibrin sheath&quot; encasing the catheter tip. The fibrin sheath blocks the withdrawal of blood from the catheter by creating a one-way valve over the catheter tip, impairing the ability to withdraw blood from the catheter but allowing infusion through it, the so-called &quot;withdrawal occlusion.&quot; Propagation of thrombus around the catheter ultimately prevents both infusion and withdrawal from the catheter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of catheter-related venous thrombosis are variable, and patients are often only mildly symptomatic, while some have more debilitating symptoms.

Patients with central catheters, particularly peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), can also present with phlebitis of the superficial veins.

The chances of a false positive study are very low; however, nonocclusive mural thrombus and thrombus in the proximal subclavian or innominate veins (generally shadowed by the clavicle and sternum) may not be adequately visualized.

The initial management of superficial phlebitis related to peripheral intravenous catheters consists of discontinuing the intravenous infusion and removing the peripheral catheter. Symptomatic care includes extremity elevation, warm or cool compresses, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS).

Based upon a systematic review of randomized trials, anticoagulation is suggested in patients with lower extremity superficial vein thrombosis who are at risk for deep vein thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phlebitis-and-thrombosis-of-the-superficial-lower-extremity-veins#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phlebitis and thrombosis of the superficial lower extremity veins&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>Extrapolating from these data, it would be reasonable to also consider anticoagulation for patients with upper extremity superficial vein thrombosis who are at risk for deep vein thrombosis (eg, superficial thrombosis in proximity to the deep veins, thrombophilia). </p><p>Patients with proximal basilic or cephalic vein thrombosis who remain symptomatic (eg, edema, pain) in spite of catheter removal may also be considered for treatment to manage symptoms. As with superficial thrombophlebitis of the lower extremity, anticoagulation in these patients should be highly effective in alleviating symptoms, especially in the setting of malignancy. Whether anticoagulation improves the future patency of the superficial veins has not been adequately investigated. The duration of therapy under these circumstances needs to be guided by clinical judgment. Ultrasound can be repeated if symptoms progress to rule out extension into the deep venous system. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Duplex ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p>The catheter insertion site should also be monitored. Excessive pain may indicate suppurative phlebitis, chemical phlebitis, or extravasation of infused fluid into the subcutaneous tissues. Additional treatment, including surgery, may be required to manage extravasation injuries. Antibiotics should be initiated if there is any concern for suppurative thrombophlebitis.

Thus, therapy for UEDVT is directed toward preventing this complication. Anticoagulant therapy is generally effective for preventing pulmonary embolism in patients with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. By inference, anticoagulation should also be effective for preventing embolization of thrombi from the thoracic veins, although treatment failures occur at both locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, no treatment scheme has been rigorously evaluated for its efficacy in preventing embolization from upper extremity sources. As a result, recommendations for the treatment of UEDVT are based largely upon indirect evidence from the experience with deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities.

Individual case reports suggest that some patients with catheter-related thrombosis have symptoms that do not resolve; however, these patients appear to be in the minority.</p><p>Catheter-induced UEDVT is generally managed more conservatively compared with primary (spontaneous) UEDVT. The more aggressive approach used with spontaneous UEDVT therapy is due to a higher incidence of postphlebitic sequelae. A systematic review identified seven studies that evaluated the incidence and risk factors for post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) following upper extremity deep venous thrombosis in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The incidence ranged from 7 to 46 percent. Residual thrombosis and axillosubclavian vein thrombosis were associated with PTS, but catheter-associated UEDVT was associated with decreased risk.

In patients with acute UEDVT involving the axillary or more proximal veins, we recommend anticoagulation, as described for lower extremity DVT, provided there are no contraindications, with or without catheter removal. For isolated brachial vein thrombosis, the intensity and duration of anticoagulation is uncertain, and decision-making should be individualized. Our recommendation is consistent with guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and other international guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/73,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75,76</a>]. </p><p>The type and intensity of anticoagulant therapy with catheter-induced UEDVT should be similar to that given to prevent embolization of thrombi from the deep veins of the legs. We suggest initial therapy with parenteral anticoagulants (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>) followed by a vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) or LMWH. Sufficient data are lacking to recommend the use of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for the management of the acute phase of catheter-induced UEDVT. Therapeutic options for deep vein thrombosis are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The optimal duration of anticoagulation when the catheter stays in place has not been standardized. The ACCP guidelines recommend continuing anticoagulation as long as the central venous catheter remains in place, especially in patients with cancer. If the catheter needs to be removed, there are currently no data to indicate whether central venous catheter removal should be preceded by a brief period of anticoagulation to minimize risk of embolization.</p><p>There is uncertainty about the need to anticoagulate patients with thrombosis confined to the brachial vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The risk of long-term chronic venous sequelae from venous obstruction at this site generally appears to be quite small. The ACCP guidelines favor anticoagulation for up to three months if the thrombosis is symptomatic, is associated with cancer, or the catheter remains in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of asymptomatic UEDVT is more controversial and less well defined than treatment of symptomatic thrombi.

In addition, asymptomatic UEDVT can cause permanent obstruction in the subclavian vein and may interfere with subsequent catheter placement, resulting in loss of central venous access on the affected side.

Given this uncertainty, we continue to agree with various society guidelines that do <strong>not</strong> recommend routine prophylactic anticoagulation for the sole purpose of preventing catheter-related thrombosis, even in patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/76,88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,88,89</a>]. Nevertheless, prophylactic heparin may have a role in some high-risk patients when the perceived risk of thrombosis outweighs the risk of bleeding and the burden of anticoagulation. High-risk factors include previous venous thrombosis, bulky disease, or hereditary thrombophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/23,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,90</a>]. Research efforts should focus on identifying patients most likely to benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation.</p><p>A large trial randomly assigned 420 high-risk ambulatory patients about to undergo chemotherapy for cancer to no anticoagulation, LMWH, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Compared with no anticoagulation, prophylactic anticoagulation significantly reduced the incidence of catheter-related DVT (LMWH: 8 versus 20 events; warfarin: 14 versus 20 events), and catheter nonrelated deep vein thrombosis (LMWH: 1 versus 7 events; warfarin: 1 versus 7 events), with no difference between warfarin and LMWH. A later meta-analysis that included trials similar to those in an earlier review as well as the large trial found a significant benefit for prophylactic anticoagulation (heparin, warfarin) over no anticoagulation for symptomatic DVT (risk ratio [RR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. An updated Cochrane review identified 12 randomized trials (2823 patients) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic <span class=\"nowrap\">heparin/LMWH</span> or low-dose vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for prevention of catheter-related venous thrombosis in patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Prophylactic heparin was associated with a decreased risk for symptomatic DVT when compared with no heparin (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27-0.86), and low-dose warfarin was associated with reduced incidence of asymptomatic DVT when compared with no treatment (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30-0.62). There were no significant differences in bleeding, infection, or mortality for either heparin or VKAs compared with no treatment. Interestingly, the observed baseline risk of thrombosis was lower in later studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. This would suggest that advances in the care of central venous catheters (port flushing), choice of catheter insertion and location, and the availability of new material and design of catheters have contributed to an overall lower risk of catheter-induced thrombosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13360722\"><span class=\"h2\">Heparin-bonded catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of central venous catheters are available that have heparin-bonded coatings designed to reduce catheter-associated thrombosis.

The majority of venous thrombotic events are due to peripheral intravenous catheters. Central catheters can cause upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT) involving the subclavian, jugular, axillary, or brachial veins, which may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome of the upper extremity. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wide variation is reported for the incidence of catheter-induced UEDVT depending upon the catheter type, location, and population studied. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for catheter-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis include catheter-related factors (eg, catheter malposition, catheter size), the presence of prothrombotic states (congenital or acquired), hormonal therapy, and infusion of irritating substances. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of symptoms and signs of catheter-induced venous thrombosis are related to local effects of the thrombus (ie, phlebitis, venous obstruction). Although less common, symptoms and signs arising from embolization to the pulmonary circulation, or paradoxically to the systemic circulation via a patent foramen ovale (eg, brain), can also occur. A high index of suspicion for occult UEDVT is needed when susceptible patients with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary emboli or acute neurologic insult are being evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duplex ultrasound is the screening test of choice when UEDVT is suspected in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Patients who have had prior UEDVT should be screened for patency of the central veins prior to placement of a subsequent catheter. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial phlebitis related to peripheral intravenous catheters should be managed first by discontinuing the intravenous infusion and removing the peripheral catheter. Symptomatic care consists of extremity elevation, warm or cool compresses, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Excessive pain not controlled with NSAIDs may indicate the presence of a suppurative phlebitis, chemical phlebitis, or extravasation injury. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Phlebitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with catheter-induced UEDVT, we suggest anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For uncomplicated cases, three months of anticoagulation therapy should be sufficient. A longer duration of anticoagulation may be warranted if the catheter remains in place, particularly for patients with cancer. The catheter can be left in place if it is functional and there is an ongoing need. For noncancer patients with thrombosis confined to the brachial vein, there is uncertainty about the need for anticoagulation once the catheter has been removed in patients. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with catheter-induced UEDVT, we suggest not instituting deep vein thrombolysis as a first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Compared with anticoagulation, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that thrombolysis leads to any better outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Deep vein fibrinolysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with indwelling upper extremity catheters, we recommend <strong>not</strong> administering prophylactic anticoagulation (vitamin K antagonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, low-molecular-weight heparin) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients with cancer, we suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely administering prophylactic anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). It may be reasonable to administer prophylactic anticoagulation in high&ndash;risk patients when the perceived risk of thrombosis outweighs the risk of bleeding. High-risk factors include previous venous thrombosis, bulky disease, hereditary thrombophilia, or suboptimal catheter tip location.
