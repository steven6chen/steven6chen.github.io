Ear infections are common in children.</p><p>Ear infections often occur in children after they get a cold. Fluid can build up in the middle part of the ear behind the eardrum. This fluid can become infected and press on the eardrum, causing it to bulge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54739 \">figure 1</a>). This causes symptoms.</p><p>In some children, some fluid can stay in the ear for weeks to months after the pain and infection have gone away. This fluid can cause hearing loss that is usually mild and temporary. If the hearing loss lasts a long time, it can sometimes lead to problems with language and speech, especially in children who are at risk for problems with language or learning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392742097\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an ear infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants and young children, the symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulling on the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being more fussy or less active than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having no appetite and not eating as much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting or diarrhea</p><p/><p>In older children, symptoms often include ear pain or temporary hearing loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392742104\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my child has an ear infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think your child has an ear infection, see a doctor or nurse. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has an ear infection. He or she will ask about symptoms, do an exam, and look in your child's ears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392742111\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can give your child medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) to reduce the pain. But never give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to a child younger than 18 years old. Aspirin can cause a dangerous condition called Reye syndrome.</p><p>Most doctors do not recommend treating ear infections with cold and cough medicines. These medicines can have dangerous side effects in young children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392742118\"><span class=\"h1\">How are ear infections treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat ear infections with antibiotics. These medicines kill the bacteria that cause some ear infections. But doctors do not always prescribe these medicines right away. That's because many ear infections are caused by viruses &ndash; not bacteria &ndash; and antibiotics do not kill viruses. Plus, many children get over ear infections without antibiotics.</p><p>Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics to treat ear infections in infants younger than 2 years old. For children older than 2, doctors sometimes hold off on antibiotics.</p><p>Your child's doctor might suggest watching your child's symptoms for 1 or 2 days before trying antibiotics if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child is healthy in general</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain and fever are not severe</p><p/><p>You and your doctor should discuss whether or not to give your child antibiotics. This will depend on your child's age, health problems, and how many ear infections he or she has had in the past.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392742125\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I follow up with the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call the doctor or nurse:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After 1 to 2 days, if you are watching your child's symptoms. If the pain and fever have not gotten better, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After 2 days, if your child is taking antibiotics and his or her symptoms have not improved or are worse.</p><p/><p>You should also see the doctor or nurse a few months after an ear infection if your child is younger than 2 or has language or learning problems. Your doctor or nurse will do an ear exam to make sure the fluid is gone. Your child might also need follow-up testing to check his or her hearing.</p><p>If the fluid in the ear is causing hearing loss and does not go away after several months, your doctor might suggest treatment to help drain the fluid. This involves a surgery in which a doctor places a small tube in the eardrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67163 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392742132\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I reduce the number of ear infections my child gets?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child gets a lot of ear infections, ask the doctor what you can do to prevent repeat infections. The doctor might suggest that your child get routine vaccines (that he or she might be missing). The doctor might also talk with you about the risks and benefits of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving your child an antibiotic every day during certain months of the year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing surgery to place a small tube in your child's eardrum</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392742082\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eustachian-tube-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eustachian tube problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-tubes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear tubes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tonsillectomy-and-adenoidectomy-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
