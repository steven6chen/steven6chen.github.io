In addition to direct trauma, rapid deceleration and other mechanisms can cause injury to thoracic structures. Major concerns include chest wall injury, such as rib fractures or flail chest; cardiovascular injury, such as blunt aortic injury or cardiac contusion; and pulmonary injury, such as contusions or lacerations. Blunt aortic injury is the most lethal injury of the thorax if untreated.</p><p>The clinician must first concentrate on assessing life-threatening conditions. Depending on the presentation, evaluation may consist solely of a thorough history and physical examination or may require multiple tests including plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scans, and echocardiography.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the epidemiology, mechanisms, and general approach to the management of injuries sustained in adults from blunt thoracic trauma.

Most patients with such injuries die in the field. Pneumothorax is a common complication of thoracic trauma. The incidence of occult pneumothorax among victims of blunt trauma is less clear, ranging from 2 to 55 percent in patients who undergo computed tomography (CT) of the chest or abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The risk of pulmonary contusion appears to correlate with crash severity and the proximity of the site of impact to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

However, most of these studies evaluated patients involved in high energy trauma admitted to trauma centers. In one study, researchers evaluated the chest radiographs of all alert blunt trauma patients presenting to their emergency department following blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They found that multiple rib fractures (&gt;2) was the most common serious thoracic injury, and occurred in approximately 5 percent of patients. The presence of multiple rib fractures, particularly ribs one through three, increases the risk of intrathoracic injury, especially in the elderly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fractures of the sternum and scapula</strong> &ndash; The epidemiology of these injuries is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults#H15009018\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of chest wall trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND MECHANISM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3179290\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy and physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rib cage, intercostal muscles, and costal cartilage form the basic structure of the chest wall. In addition, neurovascular bundles comprised of an intercostal nerve, artery, and vein run along each rib. The inner lining of the chest wall is the parietal pleura. Visceral pleura covers the major thoracic organs. Between the two is a potential space with a small amount of lubricating fluid. The anterior chest wall also contains the sternum and pectoralis major and minor muscles, as well as the clavicle at its superior border. Posteriorly, the scapula provides added protection to the superior thorax. The scapula is a dense bone encased in muscle and significant force is necessary to fracture it.</p><p>The chest wall has two important functions: to assist in the mechanics of respiration and to protect the intrathoracic organs. Adequate ventilation is accomplished by creating negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration and positive pressure during expiration. During inspiration, a combination of diaphragmatic excursion and contraction of the intercostal muscles to raise the ribs in a &quot;bucket-handle&quot; fashion increases intrathoracic volume and decreases intrathoracic pressure, which then pulls air passively into the lungs. In expiration, this process is reversed: all the muscles relax and intrathoracic pressure passively increases and volume decreases, forcing air out of the lungs.</p><p>The chest wall protects against devastating injuries to the intrathoracic structures. In fulfilling this role, the chest wall is commonly injured. While generally not life-threatening, chest wall injuries can be extremely painful and can lead to significant morbidity if not recognized and treated appropriately.</p><p>The mediastinum is an anatomic division of the thorax extending from the diaphragm inferiorly to the thoracic inlet superiorly. Its borders include the sternum anteriorly, the vertebral column posteriorly, and the parietal pleura laterally. Contained within the mediastinum are the heart, aorta, trachea, and esophagus. Injuries to any of these structures are potentially life-threatening. One lung is located lateral to each side of the mediastinum.</p><p>With blunt trauma, the most common isolated mediastinal injury involves the aorta. Hemorrhage from other nearby structures, such as venous lacerations or fractures of the ribs, sternum or vertebra, can manifest as mediastinal blood, raising concern for aortic injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73037 \">algorithm 1</a>). Aortic injuries are mainly transverse tears with relatively smooth margins. The underlying injury ranges from a simple subintimal hemorrhage, with or without intimal laceration, to complete aortic transection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The diaphragm constitutes the floor of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm exhibits substantial movement with inspiration and expiration, and thus posttraumatic pain in the lower thorax may reflect intraabdominal as well as intrathoracic injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3179283\"><span class=\"h2\">Selected mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt chest trauma occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), assaults, and falls. Particularly in the elderly, apparently minor trauma (eg, fall from standing) can cause serious injury. Any of the mechanisms listed can cause rib fractures, flail chest, or chest wall contusions.</p><p>Aortic tears usually occur from high-energy injuries to the thorax, often following rapid deceleration. Several theories for the mechanism of aortic disruptions have been proposed and it is likely that a number of forces are involved. These theories are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury#H1066952822\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of injury'</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary contusions most often result from high-energy MVCs. Mortality is difficult to quantify because pulmonary contusions often occur in tandem with other severe injuries. Damage leads to ventilation-perfusion inequalities and decreased lung compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Researchers postulate several possible mechanisms for pulmonary contusion, including the implosion theory, where air expansion causes alveolar tearing; the &quot;inertia effect,&quot; which occurs when lighter alveoli are stripped from the heavier bronchi; and the &quot;spalling effect,&quot; which involves shearing at the gas-liquid interface.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prehospital management depends on patient symptoms and severity of illness. Prehospital providers should treat patients with possible underlying pulmonary, cardiac, or major extrathoracic injuries according to the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), paying special attention to the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Rapid transport to the closest trauma center is crucial; interventions causing unnecessary delay must be avoided. Basic interventions, such as cervical spine immobilization, are appropriate, as is the use of high-flow oxygen and monitoring. Transport should not be delayed to place IV lines or perform endotracheal intubation, unless the patient is in extremis and cannot be stabilized with bag mask ventilation. More extensive intervention may be needed if prolonged transport time is expected. A detailed discussion of prehospital trauma care is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the patient shows no evidence of respiratory difficulty or underlying injury, no intervention may be necessary. Before leaving the scene of a vehicular accident, prehospital caretakers should quickly make note of important features associated with increased risk of injury and convey these findings to clinicians at the trauma center upon arrival. Such findings include: significant intrusion into the passenger compartment, deformed steering wheel, ejection of the patient from the vehicle, and fatality at the scene. Prehospital hypotension is an important indication of significant injury and this finding must be communicated to the clinicians assuming care of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial resuscitation and management of the trauma patient is based upon protocols from Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and is reviewed separately; details related to initial management of blunt thoracic trauma (BTT) are discussed below. A basic algorithm for management of BTT is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81674 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians first assess and stabilize the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation, in that order (ABCs). The one caveat to this principle in patients with respiratory distress following chest trauma is that breathing may take priority over airway. If the patient is in respiratory distress due to a tension pneumothorax, the clinician should relieve the pneumothorax before performing endotracheal intubation, if needed. Positive pressure ventilation following intubation will exacerbate a pneumothorax.</p><p>After addressing the patient's ABCs, the clinician continues the initial evaluation taking into account vital signs, the initial presentation, and the mechanism of injury. Mechanism is less predictive of injury severity and ultimate disposition than abnormal vital signs in the setting of blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>For any patient with unstable vital signs, hypoxia, or obvious severe injury (eg, flail chest, multiple rib fractures, large open wounds), the clinician performs a rapid search with concurrent management of immediate life-threatening injuries of the head, cervical spine, abdomen, chest, and pelvis. With blunt chest trauma such injuries include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tension pneumothorax</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemothorax with severe, active bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial tamponade from myocardial injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheobronchial disruption</p><p/><p>Patients with respiratory distress, marked hemodynamic instability, or severe injury are intubated. Rapid sequence intubation is the preferred approach whenever possible, avoiding pretreatment and induction agents with the potential to cause hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Suspected tension pneumothorax is treated with immediate tube thoracostomy or needle decompression using a large angiocatheter (eg, 14 gauge). Needles as long as 7 to 8 cm may be necessary depending upon the size of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Acceptable sites for needle insertion include the second or third intercostal space in the midclavicular line or the fifth intercostal space in the anterior or mid-axillary line; however, success rates are likely higher when the anterior or mid-axillary line of the fifth intercostal space is used. If needle decompression is performed first, it is followed by tube thoracostomy soon afterwards. A chest tube size of at least 36 French is used. Needle decompression is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Needle chest decompression'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient stabilizes in the emergency department (ED) and does not require emergent operative treatment, a chest CT with contrast is performed to define the extent of thoracic injury and exclude aortic rupture. If the patient is unable to undergo CT, due to the need for immediate operation, transesophageal echocardiography can be performed in the ED or operating room to assess the aorta and heart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pericardial tamponade, most likely from myocardial rupture, is detected by ultrasound as the first study of the standard FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64027\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64027 \">movie 1</a>). Pericardiocentesis is performed immediately in patients with a pericardial effusion and significant hypotension. In patients requiring transport to another hospital, a catheter should be placed when pericardiocentesis is performed. The catheter allows for drainage during transport should fluid reaccumulate and cause hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-pericardiocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency pericardiocentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If hemodynamic compromise is severe and tamponade cannot be relieved by percutaneous drainage or if the patient develops cardiac arrest while being resuscitated, emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H4933905\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Emergency department thoracotomy (EDT)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique#H1247118578\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resuscitative thoracotomy: Technique&quot;, section on 'Preparation'</a>.)</p><p>Hemothorax is treated with tube thoracostomy using a large (minimum 36 French) chest tube. Immediate bloody drainage of &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> is generally considered an indication for thoracotomy in the operating room. Vital signs, fluid resuscitation requirements, and concomitant injuries are also considered when determining the need for thoracotomy.</p><p>The evaluation of hemodynamically stable patients without obvious signs of injury varies depending upon mechanism, age, and clinical suspicion. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency thoracotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of blunt trauma, emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) rarely results in successful resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. Among blunt trauma patients, EDT enables neurologically intact survival in approximately less than 5 percent of those in shock, 1 percent of those without vital signs upon arrival to the ED, and none of those without signs of life in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A more complete discussion of EDT, including epidemiology, indications, and practice guidelines, is found separately.

A trauma or thoracic surgeon should be readily available if EDT is performed: immediate surgical intervention may be necessary if the patient is to survive.

A systematic review of 27 observational studies involving 1369 blunt trauma patients reported an overall survival rate with good neurological outcome of only 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Depending on the presentation, this may be as simple as a thorough history and physical examination or may require multiple tests, including radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scans, and echocardiography.</p><p>The clinician first determines whether the patient is at low or high risk for significant injury. This determination is based on the vital signs (most important), the mechanism and potential for injury, and the patient's complaints and general clinical appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,2,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8-10</a>]. The limited utility of mechanism should be emphasized: a young, healthy patient involved in a severe, rollover motor vehicle collision (MVC) may sustain no injuries, while a frail elderly patient who trips and falls may incur multiple rib fractures accompanied by a pulmonary contusion. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and mechanism'</a> above.)</p><p>Studies suggest the history and physical examination are insensitive for detecting intrathoracic injury. This insensitivity stems in part from the nature of the studies, which often include a heterogeneous mix of patients and injuries, a low number of positive findings, and lack follow-up.</p><p>The risk of serious injury is low among alert patients without discomfort, dyspnea, or tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Hypoxia and abnormal lung sounds are the most specific signs for pneumothorax or hemothorax, while chest pain and tenderness are most sensitive, albeit nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Normal lung sounds showed a high-negative predictive value for pneumothorax in one prospective, observational study, but the number of patients with abnormal findings was too low to draw definitive conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest radiograph (CXR) is the initial test for all patients with blunt thoracic trauma who warrant imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The CXR is inexpensive, noninvasive, easy to obtain, and in many instances reveals useful information. For these reasons, we suggest a CXR be obtained in all patients who have sustained blunt thoracic trauma of any significance, unless the patient requires immediate surgery or warrants immediate chest CT. Patients with minor trauma whose clinical evaluation reveals no signs of injury may not require a CXR; a decision instrument to help determine whether to forego a CXR is described at the end of this section.</p><p>The CXR is systematically reviewed for evidence of hemothorax, pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, fractures, and aortic injury. Studies to determine CXR findings suggestive of blunt aortic injury (BAI) are limited by their observational design and the small number of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Nevertheless, although no single finding on CXR possesses high sensitivity or specificity for BAI, the following findings on a plain CXR increase the likelihood of BAI and indicate a need for further investigation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wide mediastinum (supine CXR &gt;8 cm; upright CXR &gt;6 cm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obscured aortic knob; abnormal aortic contour</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left &quot;apical cap&quot; (ie, pleural blood above apex of left lung)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large left hemothorax</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deviation of nasogastric tube rightward</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deviation of trachea rightward <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right mainstem bronchus downward</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wide left paravertebral stripe</p><p/><p/><p>A widened mediastinum is a sensitive but nonspecific sign of aortic injury. Such injuries account for about 20 percent of abnormal mediastinal widening on CXR after blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Further study, usually CT of the chest, is performed if CXR abnormalities consistent with aortic injury are identified. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chest CT: Indications, accuracy, and decision rules'</a> below.)</p><p>Initial evaluation with a portable, anterior-posterior (AP) CXR is performed in patients at greater risk of significant injury who must remain in the ED for closer monitoring. Such patients include those with: major mechanism of injury, hemodynamic instability, significant tenderness, a seatbelt sign across the abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95085\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95085 \">picture 1</a>), hypoxia, or clinical signs of multiple rib fractures. The plain CXR may not have sufficient sensitivity to detect injury in these patients, and minor abnormalities on CXR or clinical concern are sufficient to justify more detailed imaging with chest CT or other modalities.</p><p>The stable patient with minimal findings (eg, minor abrasion, mild tenderness, and normal vital signs) can be sent to radiology for standard posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral CXR, provided the physical examination is otherwise unremarkable and there is no suspicion of major injury. Patients with pain and tenderness of the lower ribs, especially with pleuritic complaints, or abdominal pain and tenderness, are at higher risk for both intrathoracic and intraabdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Normal PA and lateral chest radiographs in a low-risk patient obviate the need for additional studies to rule out intrathoracic or chest wall injury. Rib films are rarely needed. They may provide more information about fractures but rarely change management. The clinician can treat patients likely to have sustained a rib fracture on the basis of symptoms and signs, despite the absence of radiographic evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The NEXUS Chest Decision Instrument studies evaluated the utility of chest imaging in the assessment of blunt trauma. In practice, the instrument is used most often to determine the need for chest CT, but it may also be used to help determine the need for CXR. The NEXUS investigations include a prospective validation study involving 9905 patients that reported on the tool&rsquo;s effectiveness for identifying blunt trauma patients at low risk of intrathoracic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The instrument uses seven simple criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;60 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanism involving rapid deceleration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intoxication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">alertness/mental</span> status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distracting painful injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness to chest wall palpitation </p><p/><p>Clinically significant intrathoracic injury is highly unlikely in the absence of all criteria. Although the study found the rule to have high sensitivity (98.8 percent; 95% CI, 98.1-99.3) and negative predictive value (98.5 percent; 95% CI, 97.6-99.1), specificity was low (13.3 percent; 95% CI, 12.6-14.1). Determination of the need for chest CT following blunt trauma is discussed below.

Ultrasound of the chest is also commonly performed in the ED to rule out or diagnose pneumothorax or hemothorax. Two signs, the sliding lung and &quot;comet tail&quot; artifact, appear to reliably rule out pneumothorax. The use of ultrasound in thoracic trauma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest CT: Indications, accuracy, and decision rules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) is far greater than plain radiography for intrathoracic injury, and allows for detailed evaluation of the pulmonary and mediastinal structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. CT provides greater sensitivity in diagnosing small pneumothoraces, as well as pneumomediastinum and pulmonary contusions and lacerations. When a multidetector CT scan is used, reconstructions of the aorta and bony structures can be completed rapidly if there are any findings or concerns raised in the initial physical examination or radiological evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/15,44,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,44,48</a>]. </p><p>Pending further study, we believe the decision to obtain a chest CT for blunt thoracic trauma should be based upon clinical findings, including the patient&rsquo;s mental status and distracting injuries, the mechanism of injury, available resources, clinician judgement, institutional tolerance for delayed diagnosis (eg, forgoing a CT in favor of serial examinations and close observation), and other relevant factors. </p><p>The use of chest CT for trauma evaluation has increased dramatically, and in many centers, patients involved in high-energy trauma are sent almost immediately for CT before a chest radiograph can be performed. Patients with a low-risk mechanism, minor injuries by examination, and normal chest radiographs generally do not require CT imaging, which may be overused in these circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/44,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,49-51</a>]. However, findings from some observational studies suggest that a substantial number of patients may sustain clinically significant intrathoracic injuries that are identified by CT but do not manifest abnormal findings on plain chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/46,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,52</a>]. Conversely, abnormalities apparent on a plain radiograph strongly suggest the presence of a clinically significant injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. We believe that it is reasonable to obtain a chest CT in patients with concerning clinical findings (eg, severe pain or marked chest tenderness, hypoxia, dyspnea, tachypnea) despite an unremarkable plain chest radiograph, and in patients with an abnormal plain chest radiograph despite the absence of obvious clinical signs of injury.</p><p>The NEXUS research group has developed and prospectively validated decision instruments to help determine which adults with blunt thoracic trauma can safely forego CT imaging of the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/43,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,54</a>]. The first validation study included 9905 patients over the age of 14, evaluated at nine trauma centers, whose initial work-up for blunt chest trauma included a plain chest radiograph, chest CT, or both, while a subsequent study enrolled 11,477 patients over 14 with blunt thoracic trauma evaluated at eight trauma centers. </p><p>The earlier iteration of the NEXUS decision instrument included the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;60 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intoxication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal alertness or mental status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest wall tenderness &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distracting painful injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid deceleration mechanism (ie, fall &gt;20 feet [&gt;6 m], or MVC &gt;40 mph [&gt;65 <span class=\"nowrap\">km/hour])</span></p><p/><p>If all criteria are absent, the patient has a very low risk for intrathoracic injury and chest imaging is not indicated. In the initial validation study, the instrument demonstrated sensitivity of 98.8 percent and specificity of 13.3 percent for any thoracic injury seen on chest imaging. </p><p>In a subsequent iteration of the NEXUS decision instrument (Chest CT-All), age &gt;60, chest pain, intoxication, and abnormal mental function were removed, while the criteria listed immediately below were added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In addition, rapid deceleration mechanism was removed from a related decision instrument created by the same group explicitly to detect major thoracic injury (Chest CT-Major). Injuries considered major included: aortic or great vessel injury, diaphragm rupture, pneumothorax or hemothorax requiring thoracostomy, spine or other major fracture requiring surgical repair, esophageal, tracheal, or bronchial injury requiring surgical intervention, pulmonary contusion requiring ventilatory support, and several others. Minor injuries often warranted overnight observation but no significant intervention was required.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal plain chest radiograph</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sternal tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic spine tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scapular tenderness</p><p/><p>While all the NEXUS decision rules demonstrated high sensitivity for major injury (approximately 99 percent), Chest CT-All had a specificity of 20.8 percent (95% CI 19.2-22.4) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.8 percent (95% CI 98.9-100) for major injury, while for either major or minor injury the rule demonstrated a specificity of 25.5 percent (95% CI 23.5-27.5%) and a NPV of 93.9 percent (95% CI 91.5-95.8). Chest CT-Major had a specificity of 31.7 percent (95% CI 29.9-33.5) and a NPV of 99.9 percent (95% CI 99.3-100) for major injury. </p><p>We believe the NEXUS rules can serve as useful guidelines and may decrease the number of unnecessary CT scans obtained. However, the rules must be applied correctly. While the absence of all criteria indicates low risk, the presence of any one criterion does not necessarily indicate high risk and the need for CT; clinical judgement is needed. In a follow-up study, 269 of the blunt thoracic trauma patients included sustained major injuries and researchers noted that except for an abnormal plain chest radiograph, the risk for major injury remained low in the presence of any single criterion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of an abnormal plain radiograph for major injury were relatively high, 73.7 (95% CI 68.1-78.6) and 83.9 (95% CI 83.6-84.2), respectively, highlighting the importance of carefully assessing any plain chest radiograph obtained. Clinicians should not hesitate to obtain imaging studies if they have concerns based upon their clinical assessment, regardless of the decision instrument. </p><p>Whether to obtain a CT purely on the basis of a high-risk mechanism remains controversial. Results of studies have been mixed, but tend to favor performing a chest CT in patients with significant mechanisms of injury or severe concomitant injuries. As examples, one prospective study of consecutive trauma patients with a significant mechanism of injury found that 19.6 percent of chest CT scans revealed clinically important abnormalities despite the absence of external signs of thoracic injury in the 592 hemodynamically stable patients included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A prospective study of 609 blunt trauma patients imaged with CT noted that eleven percent of chest CT scans deemed unnecessary by emergency physicians prior to their being obtained were reported to have clinically meaningful findings, including two that resulted in critical actions (spinal surgery for a T8 burst fracture and chest tube insertion for a lung laceration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A retrospective study of 108 patients involved in high energy trauma but who were hemodynamically stable and had no abnormal examination findings reported that 11 patients had abnormalities noted on CT, but none required intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients manifesting hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, or obvious severe injury require immediate assessment for life-threatening injuries with concurrent management. This is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Primary evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients who appear clinically stable without apparent injury, but have sustained high-energy blunt trauma with rapid deceleration are at risk for severe injury. Their initial evaluation is performed in the trauma or critical care area within the emergency department (ED). A portable chest radiograph (CXR) is obtained as part of this immediate evaluation. If this study is normal and no severe extrathoracic injury is identified, a posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral CXR are subsequently obtained. A chest CT is obtained if any concerning findings are identified on CXR, the patient has persistent chest pain or dyspnea, or the patient is unable to undergo a thorough clinical examination because of an extrathoracic injury.</p><p>Patients who appear clinically stable, without apparent injury, without a concerning mechanism, and without abnormal findings on standard PA and lateral CXR require no further evaluation, with the possible exception of an electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is performed in all patients with anterior chest trauma, the elderly, and patients with a history of coronary heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac injury from blunt trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients without evidence of injury after appropriate evaluation may be discharged. Patients are informed of the possibility of delayed presentations of injury (eg, pneumothorax) and told to return to the ED immediately for such symptoms as severe pain, difficulty breathing, and lightheadedness. Of note, a small percentage of patients who sustain minor thoracic injury develop a delayed complication or longer term disability of some type, according to prospective follow-up studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>].

Almost 80 percent of BAIs cause immediate death from aortic transection. In a minority of patients the adventitia and mediastinal structures contain the rupture, allowing the patient to survive transport to the hospital. If BAI goes undiagnosed, these patients generally sustain an aortic rupture within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Prompt ED diagnosis is crucial and may be lifesaving in some patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73037 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>There are no clinical signs or examination findings with sufficient sensitivity or specificity to detect BAI. Therefore, the clinician should use appropriate radiographic studies to assess every patient involved in high-energy trauma with rapid deceleration or who shows signs of severe chest injury. The initial study is a chest radiograph (CXR), which should be closely scrutinized for any signs of aortic injury. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> above.)</p><p>The risk of aortic injury is negligible in patients with a truly normal CXR, no significant injury on examination, and a mechanism that does not involve rapid deceleration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/38,44,50,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,44,50,61</a>]. No further testing is needed in such patients.</p><p>Any abnormality on CXR should be followed by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. A normal CT scan essentially rules out BAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/36,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,62,63</a>]. Clinicians often have difficulty obtaining an upright, posterior anterior (PA) CXR in a trauma patient, and subtle abnormalities may be missed on supine studies. If the clinician has a strong suspicion for BAI, CT scan should be obtained, regardless of CXR appearance. CT scan is extremely sensitive and specific for BAI, and surgeons can determine the need for operative intervention on the basis of CT findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/61,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,64</a>]. </p><p>The other modalities used to diagnose BAI include angiography and transesophageal echocardiography. While angiography is the traditional gold standard, and is theoretically more sensitive than CT, its use should be reserved for those patients with equivocal CT scans. Angiography is more time consuming and invasive, and rarely improves upon CT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should obtain CT of the chest to assess for BAI if mechanistic, clinical, or radiographic evidence suggests the possibility of intrathoracic injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62204 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73037 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Among patients without abnormal CXR findings in whom chest CT is performed solely based on mechanism, the study leads to changes in management only 5 percent of the time.

Therefore it is difficult to draw conclusions about the appropriate use of CT in patients without evidence of severe injury, based solely on mechanism. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chest CT: Indications, accuracy, and decision rules'</a> above.)</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an excellent modality to assess for BAI in patients too unstable for chest CT. TEE has high sensitivity and specificity for BAI, can be performed in the emergency department or the operating room, requires no contrast, and provides information about cardiac injury and function.</p><p>TEE is operator dependent and suffers in some studies from loss of sensitivity as the interposition of the air-filled trachea between the aorta and esophagus creates a blind spot, precluding adequate evaluation of the distal ascending aorta and proximal arch. It should not be performed in patients with unstable cervical spine injuries or esophageal injuries. </p><p>TEE compares favorably to angiography or CT scan in the majority of cases and diagnoses some intimal tears not seen on corresponding angiography, although the clinical significance of these tears is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>].

The trachea is protected from injury by its position relative to the mandible, sternum and vertebral column, and its relative elasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Injury of the cervical trachea is uncommon but can occur from a direct blow, which may be of low energy; injury of the intrathoracic trachea results from high-energy trauma, generally motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) and sometimes crush injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].

Intrathoracic injury can be subtle and indolent, presenting with retained secretions, recurrent pneumothoraces, and obstruction. The sine qua non of intrathoracic tracheobronchial injury is a significant air leak and pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum that reaccumulates despite tube thoracostomy. A cervical injury may present without a significant air leak, if the tear or rupture is contained by the adventitia. Signs of cervical tracheal injury include dyspnea, hoarseness, and subcutaneous emphysema.</p><p>Radiographs generally reveal marked air in local soft tissue (ie, subcutaneous emphysema). If tracheal disruption occurs, the larynx can rise, allowing the hyoid bone to ascend above the level of the third cervical vertebra, an unusual finding otherwise. Fractures of the first three ribs are associated with intrathoracic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Other radiologic findings on plain film include: persistent pneumothorax with a dependent lung, interstitial air in the wall of the trachea or mainstem bronchus, abnormal location of the endotracheal tube (ETT), and a distended ETT cuff due to protrusion of the trachea. Of note, an isolated finding of air outlining the trachea or mainstem bronchus from pneumomediastinum does not correlate significantly with tracheobronchial rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/97,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,99</a>].</p><p>Definitive diagnosis is made in the operating room or by bronchoscopy. Multidetector CT scan (MDCT) enables diagnosis of some tracheal tears, but its sensitivity is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. If tracheobronchial injury is suspected, obtain a MDCT or consult a thoracic surgeon for evaluation and possible bronchoscopy. Most patients undergo primary repair or possible lung resection, although good results using selective nonoperative management have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/96,98,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,98,100</a>].

Nevertheless, diaphragmatic rupture occurs in approximately 1 percent of blunt thoracic trauma patients, and has been reported in up to 8 percent of those requiring laparotomy. However, its incidence is increasing, as the resolution and diagnostic accuracy of multidetector CT scanners improves. While case reports exist of diaphragmatic rupture following minor trauma, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>], the great majority of cases result from high-energy injuries, most often MVCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Data from studies of highway MVCs suggest that significant intrusion (&ge;30 cm) into the passenger compartment following head-on or near-side collisions and rapid deceleration (&ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">km/hour)</span> increase the risk of sustaining a diaphragmatic rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. </p><p>Left-sided rupture occurs approximately twice as often as right sided in blunt trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/104,106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,106,107</a>]. Anatomic differences account for this discrepancy: the posterolateral aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is relatively weak and the bowel and stomach provide less protection than the liver. Diagnosis is easiest in left sided injuries when bowel enters the thoracic cavity. Small tears may require years before negative intrathoracic pressure and the positive intraabdominal pressure ultimately lead to herniation of viscera.</p><p>Severe concomitant injuries occur in most cases of diaphragmatic rupture. Injuries to the spleen and liver are relatively common, as are hemothorax and pneumothorax. Pelvic and long bone fractures, closed head injuries, and blunt aortic injury can also occur. Diaphragmatic injuries are often diagnosed incidentally during laparotomy or thoracotomy to treat coexistent injuries. Symptoms vary and generally reflect the severity of both the diaphragmatic injury (eg, tear versus rupture with herniation) and associated injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-management-of-diaphragmatic-injury-in-adults#H38057331\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and management of diaphragmatic injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Associated injuries'</a>.)</p><p>Diaphragmatic injury may be associated with epigastric and abdominal pain, referred shoulder pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, dysphagia, or shock. The initial chest radiograph (CXR) is normal or nondiagnostic in up to 50 percent of patients. Nevertheless, the CXR may reveal diagnostic findings, such as abdominal viscera in the hemithorax, a nasogastric tube in the thorax, or a focal constriction of herniated viscera at the site of the tear, producing circumferential compression (collar sign). CXR may also reveal nonspecific findings such as atelectasis, pleural effusion, loss of the usual hemidiaphragm contour, eventration of the diaphragm, and pneumothorax or hemothorax, although none of these is sensitive or specific for diaphragmatic injury. Serial CXRs may be useful, especially in patients in whom positive pressure ventilation has prevented bowel herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/97,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,108</a>]. Because many studies do not differentiate between penetrating and blunt injuries, plain CXR may have greater accuracy in detecting injuries due to blunt trauma than has been thought.</p><p>The multidetector CT (MDCT) has improved our ability to diagnose diaphragmatic injury and is the test used most often for diagnosis in hemodynamically stable patients.

Lateral views improve sensitivity, but it is unclear by how much. CT appears to be more sensitive, but no gold standard exists. We suggest a CT of the chest and an electrocardiogram (ECG) be obtained to rule out associated injuries if a sternal fracture is diagnosed on plain film.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Disposition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inpatient management of traumatic rib fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Flail chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flail chest occurs when three or more adjacent ribs are each fractured in two places, creating one floating segment comprised of several rib sections and the soft tissues between them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79746 \">figure 1</a>). This unstable section of chest wall exhibits paradoxical motion (ie, it moves in the opposite direction of the uninjured, normal-functioning chest wall) with breathing, and is associated with significant morbidity from pulmonary contusion. Abnormal motion can be difficult to detect making the diagnosis difficult.</p><p>Initial management of flail chest consists of oxygen and close monitoring for early signs of respiratory compromise, ideally using both pulse oximetry and capnography in addition to clinical observation. Stabilization of the segment with manual or object pressure restricts chest wall expansion thereby interfering with proper respiratory mechanics and is no longer used. Use of noninvasive positive airway pressure by mask may obviate the need for endotracheal intubation in alert patients. Patients with severe injuries, respiratory distress, or progressively worsening respiratory function require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures#H1068084913\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inpatient management of traumatic rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Flail chest'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2471727\"><span class=\"h2\">Sternoclavicular dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sternoclavicular (SC) joint is a diarthrodial, saddle-type, synovial joint that can sublux or dislocate anteriorly or posteriorly. The usual mechanism is a direct, high velocity blow to the medial clavicle or medial compression of the shoulder girdle. If the shoulder and arm are posterior to the plane of the body during compression, an anterior dislocation results; if the shoulder and arm are anterior, a posterior dislocation results. </p><p>Although uncommon, posterior SC joint dislocations can cause significant internal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">124,125</a>]. Posterior displacement of the clavicle can cause breathing difficulty from tracheal compression, lacerate or occlude the subclavian or brachiocephalic vessels, damage the lung parenchyma causing a pneumothorax, or injure the laryngeal nerve (which may present as hoarseness). Patients commonly present with anterior chest and shoulder pain exacerbated by arm movement, but may also complain of dyspnea, dysphagia, or upper extremity paresthesias depending upon the internal injury sustained. Examination may reveal a prominence at the SC joint with anterior dislocation, but a corresponding depression may be difficult to detect with a posterior dislocation. It is important to check pulses in the affected extremity. </p><p>Plain radiographs are not sensitive for detecting SC dislocation. While special views can be obtained to improve sensitivity (eg, &ldquo;serendipity view&rdquo; with beam angled approximately 45 degrees cephalad), it is best to obtain a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest if there is any suspicion for posterior dislocation or internal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. This study enables evaluation for both bony and vascular injury.</p><p>Initial treatment of SC dislocation depends upon the type of dislocation and the severity of associated symptoms. <strong>Anterior</strong> subluxations require no immediate treatment. However, a true anterior dislocation should be reduced within 12 to 24 hours. This can often be done as an outpatient by orthopedic surgery.</p><p><strong>Posterior</strong> SC dislocations become increasingly difficult to reduce after 24 hours so timely diagnosis and treatment is important. Many can be reduced under procedural sedation in the ED. In general reduction should be performed by an orthopedist, but airway compromise may mandate immediate reduction by the emergency physician. Consultation with cardiovascular surgery is necessary, especially when underlying hematoma is seen on CT, as bleeding from a vascular injury may occur following reduction. Unless emergent reduction must be performed due to airway compromise, the cardiovascular surgeon should evaluate the patient and make needed preparations before the reduction is performed.</p><p>Several reduction techniques have been proposed. Most are variations of a traction-abduction method, where traction is applied to the affected arm, which is held in 10 to 15 degrees of extension and 90 degrees of abduction, while pressure is applied to the posterior aspect of the clavicle. Another option is to grasp the proximal clavicle using a sterile towel clip and sterile technique and pull it anteriorly, while traction is maintained on the arm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of the patient with blunt thoracic trauma (BTT) follows the basic principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support. A basic algorithm for management of BTT is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81674 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians managing BTT first assess and stabilize the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. The one caveat to this principle is that breathing may take priority over airway if a tension pneumothorax is present. In this case, the clinician should relieve the pneumothorax before performing tracheal intubation, if needed. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When determining the likelihood of severe injury from blunt thoracic trauma, abnormal vital signs are more important than mechanism of injury. Immediate life-threatening injuries from blunt chest trauma include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aortic injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tension pneumothorax</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemothorax with severe, active bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pericardial tamponade from myocardial injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tracheobronchial disruption</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Emergent management of life-threatening injuries is discussed above (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above). Subsequent management of specific injuries is discussed separately above. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Aortic injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of blunt trauma, emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) rarely results in successful resuscitation. The subset of blunt trauma patients most likely to survive an EDT neurologically intact include either of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who lose vital signs in the emergency department (ED) and appear to have no obvious nonsurvivable injury (eg, massive head trauma, multiple severe injuries)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with cardiac tamponade rapidly diagnosed by ultrasound, with no obvious nonsurvivable injury (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Emergency thoracotomy'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a chest radiograph (CXR) be obtained in all patients who have sustained blunt thoracic trauma of any significance, unless the patient requires immediate surgery or warrants immediate chest CT. The CXR is systematically reviewed for evidence of hemothorax, pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, fractures, and aortic injury. Hemodynamically stable patients with concerning abnormalities identified on CXR generally undergo chest CT. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients involved in high-energy blunt trauma involving rapid deceleration are at significant risk for blunt aortic injury (BAI). Almost 80 percent of BAIs cause immediate death. No clinical signs or examination findings and no single finding on CXR possess adequate sensitivity or specificity for BAI. The following CXR findings increase the likelihood of BAI and indicate a need for further investigation, usually chest CT:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wide mediastinum (supine CXR &gt;8 cm; upright CXR &gt;6 cm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obscured aortic knob; abnormal aortic contour</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Left &quot;apical cap&quot; (ie, pleural blood above apex of left lung)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Large left hemothorax</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deviation of nasogastric tube rightward</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deviation of trachea rightward <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right mainstem bronchus downward</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wide left paravertebral stripe</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">BAI is discussed in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Aortic injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bedside ultrasound is a critical tool for the diagnosis of traumatic pericardial tamponade. Ultrasound is more sensitive for diagnosing pneumothorax than CXR and is also useful for diagnosing hemothorax. We suggest a chest CT be obtained if any concerning findings are identified on CXR, the patient has persistent chest pain or dyspnea, or the patient is unable to undergo a thorough clinical examination because of an extrathoracic injury. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chest CT: Indications, accuracy, and decision rules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt thoracic trauma is capable of causing a wide range of injuries, some of which are difficult to detect by physical examination or with plain radiographs. Common and important injuries are discussed in the text.
