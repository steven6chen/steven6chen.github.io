Educating the child and her family prior to this examination is important both for their reassurance and for gaining their trust. Inspection of the genital region should follow a focused general examination. Knowledge of normal prepubertal anatomy and use of accurate nomenclature are essential for describing and documenting anatomic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50025 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Gynecologic examination of newborns and children will be reviewed here. Evaluation of common vulvovaginal complaints in these patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of external genitalia is a normal part of the routine physical examination. This examination is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: The perineum&quot;, section on 'Genitourinary system'</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of the vulva, hymen, and vagina for signs of vaginal discharge is performed visually without the use of instruments. Visualization of the vagina, which is internal to the hymenal ring, in children typically requires instruments. It is performed under anesthesia for genitourinary complaints that cannot be addressed with external evaluation or in situations of suspected genitourinary pathology. These may include vaginal bleeding, persistent discharge, trauma, cystic or solid masses, suspected congenital anomalies, or acute sexual abuse with a penetrating injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76607397\"><span class=\"h2\">General guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history is obtained from both the child, if possible, and her parent(s) or legal guardian. Prior to the examination, she should be told the reason for the office evaluation. A prior traumatic incident or examination can cause girls to become apprehensive and uncooperative. The provider should explain why examination of this area is needed and how the examination will be performed, including whether swabs or lights will be used. Allowing her to maintain some control of the environment is also important. As an example, she can be offered the opportunity to select the gown that she will wear and to view the light source (otoscope, magnifying glass, or direct light).</p><p>The goal of the examination is to obtain information without traumatizing the child. The patient can be asked to climb onto the examining table; alternatively, younger patients may be examined while sitting in a parent's or guardian's lap.</p><p>Rarely, an adequate examination cannot be performed in the office setting, and so an examination under anesthesia may be required. This can be done in an outpatient ambulatory surgical unit with mask general anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When performing an anesthesia examination, a lighted Killian nasal speculum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76609 \">figure 2</a>) and a fiberoptic scope (cystoscope, flexible hysteroscope) are useful for examining the prepubertal vagina. A liquid distention media can be used for vaginoscopy once vaginal cultures have been obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76606824\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of the vulva</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the vulva can be done with the child lying supine with the legs in a &quot;frog-leg&quot; or &quot;butterfly&quot; position and, if needed, for complaints requiring visualization of the vagina, in a &quot;knee-chest&quot; position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75858 \">picture 1</a>), or supine with the knees held by the child against her chest.</p><p>Examination of the vulva in the child may be facilitated by using a colposcope, especially in cases of sexual abuse. The colposcope magnifies the area being examined and allows photography of areas of interest. However, magnification with an otoscope, hand lens, or 35 mm camera with macro-lens can also be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76606830\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of the hymen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the hymen is an important part of the evaluation of girls who may have been sexually abused. The examiner must be able to distinguish the normal hymen and its normal variants from abnormal hymens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, 90 to 95 percent of girls who are known victims of sexual abuse have a normal genital examination. Anatomic variants sometimes mistaken for signs of sexual abuse include midline sparing (linea vestibularis), lichen sclerosus, failure of midline fusion, urethral prolapse, labial adhesions, pemphigoid, and other dermatologic conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Female genitalia'</a> and <a href=\"#H76607001\" class=\"local\">'Congenital abnormalities of the hymen'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-sclerosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen sclerosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Labial adhesions'</a>.)</p><p>Hymens change with age. Newborns have redundant, estrogenized, thick, elastic hymens, often with a prominent ridge at six o'clock. White discharge due to maternal and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/newborn</span> estradiol-stimulated mucus production may appear at the hymenal orifice.</p><p>The hymen of prepubertal girls is unestrogenized, thin, and easy to assess. It may appear as a posterior rim, annular, redundant, and sleeve-like configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61605 \">figure 3</a>). In contrast, pubertal girls have thick, estrogenized, elastic hymens with white discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76606981\"><span class=\"h3\">Descriptions of hymenal tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should be cautious about making judgments about abnormalities of the hymen in children being evaluated for sexual abuse. Several texts have provided atlases and descriptions of abnormal findings. In prepubertal girls, a complete transection of hymenal tissue between four and eight o'clock (lower half) is highly suspicious for trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Accidental trauma usually spares the hymen (except in some injuries falling on objects or the edge of a bathtub or pool), whereas sexual abuse may cause this type of injury in a small number of girls. The transverse width of the hymenal opening in millimeters can be measured but is not diagnostic of sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Female genitalia'</a>.)</p><p>Bumps refer to elevations of hymenal tissue that are usually attached to longitudinal intravaginal rugae. They are a normal variant. A hymenal fold at six o'clock may appear as a bump but disappears in the knee-chest position. Rarely, a bump may occur between three and nine o'clock adjacent to a partial transection.</p><p>Thickening of the hymen occurs upon estrogenization but may also develop after trauma. Folding of the hymen may give a false appearance of thickening. This finding should be confirmed in a knee-chest position.</p><p>Midline sparing (linea vestibularis) refers to a symmetric, flat avascular area of the posterior vestibule observed in 10 percent of normal newborns. It can sometimes be confused with scarring, which usually occurs on the hymen and posterior fourchette.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76607001\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital abnormalities of the hymen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital abnormalities of the hymen occur in approximately 3 to 4 percent of the female population. They include imperforate, microperforate, cribriform, and septate hymens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57977 \">figure 4</a>). Of note, a study of 1131 female newborns did not find any cases of congenital absence of the hymen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76607090\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of pelvic organs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child is relaxed, the <span class=\"nowrap\">cervix/uterus</span> and adnexa in the child can be evaluated through examination using a finger placed rectally and the other hand abdominally with the patient lying supine. If a mass is suspected or cannot be excluded or the symptoms are worrisome, then an abdominal pelvic ultrasound is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO OBTAIN CULTURES AND OTHER SPECIMENS FROM CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some special issues to consider in obtaining cultures from children. If the child is awake, Calgiswabs moistened with sterile saline can be used to obtain the specimen by gently inserting the swab through the hymenal ring without touching the edges of the hymen. Alternatively, a soft sterile eyedropper or a small feeding tube or urethral catheter with a syringe can be gently inserted through the hymenal opening to aspirate secretions or to obtain a vaginal wash sample. Another method uses saline squirted into the vagina while three swabs are held near the hymenal ring with the labia manually closed over them. The child is then asked to cough to expel the saline from the vagina onto the swabs. Cultures are more useful and more likely to be positive in girls who have discharge evident at the time of the examination.</p><p>If gonorrhea infection is possible, tests include culture and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). A culture for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> is done by plating the swab obtained on modified Thayer-Martin-Jembec medium at the time of the examination. A NAAT can be performed on the appropriate swab or a urine sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. While culture is sometimes preferred for sexual abuse evaluations, urine NAATs are much more practical for the evaluation of routine vulvovaginitis and most sexual abuse evaluations. The laboratory should be informed that the specimen was obtained from a prepubertal child so that identification of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> is precise. Similarly, a positive NAAT should be confirmed by the laboratory. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Prepubertal victims'</a>.)</p><p>Tests for <em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>include cultures and NAATs. Cultures for <em>C. trachomatis</em> are rarely obtained; they are much less available and less sensitive than NAATs. For most patients, specimens for NAAT testing are obtained from urine or occasionally a vaginal sample and should be performed in a laboratory meeting regulatory requirements for off-label testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections#H5188506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Genital cultures are transported using a Calgiswab or Culturette II and plated by the laboratory on genitourinary media (eg, blood, MacConkey's, chocolate). A Nickerson Biggy agar or other fungal media can be used for detection of <em>Candida</em> spp if the child has itching. <em>Candida</em> vaginal infections are uncommon in prepubertal girls unless other risk factors (in diapers, recently treated with antibiotics, or diabetic). Thus, itching, mucoid vaginal discharge, or nonspecific erythema of the vulva should not be treated with antifungals without a culture or positive potassium hydroxide prep. A NAAT test can be obtained for <em>Trichomonas</em> for vaginitis in the neonate or in cases of suspected sexual abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-vulvovaginitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida vulvovaginitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis#H58793405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;, section on 'Nucleic acid amplification test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopy of vaginal secretions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microscopy is much less useful for evaluating vaginitis in prepubertal girls than adolescents because the etiology is usually nonspecific or a respiratory pathogen such as <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Nonspecific vulvovaginitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Respiratory and enteric flora'</a>.)</p><p>Saline microscopy can be performed to look for <em>Trichomonas</em>. Signs of bacterial vaginosis include positive whiff (amine) test, defined as the presence of a fishy odor when 10 percent potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added to vaginal discharge samples; clue cells (&gt;20 percent) on saline wet mount; or a homogeneous, grayish-white discharge (not present before puberty), but are rare in prepubertal girls. The addition of 10 percent KOH is helpful for diagnosing <em>Candida</em> vaginitis. Culture for <em>Candida</em> may be useful if microscopy is negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Maturation index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maturation index is rarely used but provides information about the pathophysiology of estrogen effect on the vaginal mucosa. Girls with precocious pubertal development may rarely (and only if atraumatic) have a vaginal smear obtained as part of their evaluation to determine degree of estrogenization using the maturation index. Vaginal smears for maturation index can be used to evaluate adolescents with amenorrhea if visual inspection does not confirm estrogen effect on the vaginal mucosa. In the Meisel system, 100 cells are counted and scored 0 points for parabasal cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> point for intermediate cells, and 1 point for superficial cells.</p><p>The sum of points is interpreted as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>60 to 70 points &ndash; newborns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 to 30 points &ndash; prepubertal girl</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>31 to 45 points &ndash; hypoestrogenic female</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>45 to 60 points &ndash; pubertal female</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 to 100 points &ndash; hyperestrogenic female</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal pH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaginal pH in prepubertal and pubertal girls is 6.5 to 7.5 and 3.5 to 4.5, respectively. Therefore, vaginal pH is not useful for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and vaginal trichomonas infection in prepubertal girls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of external genitalia is a normal part of the routine physical examination of children, while internal examination is restricted to those with suspected of genitourinary pathology.
