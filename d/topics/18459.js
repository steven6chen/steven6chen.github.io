Vaccines work by preparing the body to fight the germs that cause the infections.</p><p>Vaccines usually come in shots, but some come in nose sprays or medicines that children swallow. Vaccines are also called &quot;vaccinations&quot; or &quot;immunizations.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679109\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should my child get vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting vaccinated can help keep your child from getting sick. If your child does get sick, being vaccinated can keep him or her from getting severely ill. Plus, being vaccinated also helps protect the people around your child from getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679116\"><span class=\"h1\">What vaccines do babies and children get?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors recommend that babies and children get vaccines that can prevent the following infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B &ndash; Hepatitis B can cause long-term liver problems or liver cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis &ndash; Vaccines to prevent these 3 different diseases are usually grouped together in 1 shot. Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Tetanus causes the muscles to work abnormally. Pertussis, also called &quot;whooping cough,&quot; can cause a severe cough.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polio &ndash; Polio can cause muscle weakness and pain, and lead to long-term paralysis. Paralysis is when people are unable to move their arms or legs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotavirus &ndash; Rotavirus can cause severe diarrhea. Babies and children who have severe diarrhea can lose too much water and get &quot;dehydrated.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Haemophilus influenzae type B, called &quot;Hib&quot; &ndash; Hib can cause an infection of the skin, throat, joints, or tissues around the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcus &ndash; Pneumococcus is a germ that can cause an infection of the lungs, ears, blood, or tissues around the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measles, mumps, and rubella, called &quot;MMR&quot; &ndash; Vaccines to prevent these 3 different diseases are grouped together in 1 shot. Measles can cause a rash, fever, and cough. It can lead to long-term problems with the lungs, ears, or brain. Mumps causes swelling of glands in the cheeks, and can lead to long-term problems of the brain or testes. Rubella is also called &quot;German measles.&quot; If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, her baby can be born with a birth defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chickenpox &ndash; Chickenpox can cause a fever, sore throat, and rash. Some children with chickenpox can get very sick and get a lung or brain infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis A &ndash; Hepatitis A does not usually cause problems in children, but can cause severe liver disease in adults. Children who get the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis A vaccine</a> help prevent the adults around them from getting the infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flu &ndash; The flu can cause fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, or sore throat.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679123\"><span class=\"h1\">How many vaccine doses does my child need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each vaccine is different. Some vaccines work after just 1 dose. But most need 2 or more doses to prevent an infection. Vaccines usually take a few weeks to start working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679130\"><span class=\"h1\">At what ages will my child get vaccines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different vaccines are given at different ages. Most babies get their first vaccine at birth when they get their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. After that, most healthy children follow a set vaccine schedule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60399 \">table 1</a>). Even though doctors follow a set vaccine schedule, children can get certain vaccine doses at different times. For example, children can get their third dose of the polio vaccine any time from 6 to 18 months old.</p><p>Some children will follow a different vaccine schedule. Children might be on a different schedule if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have certain medical problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Started getting their vaccines later than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Started getting their vaccines on time, but then missed doses and fell behind schedule</p><p/><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will recommend a vaccine schedule that is right for your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679137\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can vaccines cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, vaccines cause no side effects. When they do cause side effects, they can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, mild swelling, or soreness where the shot was given</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or body aches</p><p/><p>Most of these side effects happen within 1 to 2 days of getting the vaccine. But they can happen 1 to 2 weeks after the getting shot for chickenpox or the shot for measles, mumps, and rubella.</p><p>Vaccines also sometimes cause more serious side effects than those listed, such as severe allergic reactions. But serious side effects are rare.</p><p>Ask your child's doctor or nurse what side effects to expect each time your child gets a vaccine. If your child has a reaction or a problem after a vaccine, let the doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679144\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child is sick, and he or she is supposed to get a vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child is sick and supposed to get a vaccine, let the doctor or nurse know. Depending on the type of vaccine and your child's symptoms, the doctor or nurse might give your child the vaccine or wait until your child is better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679151\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child has an egg allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has an egg allergy, let the doctor or nurse know. Some vaccines can have egg in them because of the way they are made. The doctor or nurse will tell you which vaccines are safe to get.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679158\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I keep track of my child's vaccines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to keep a list of the vaccines that your child gets and when he or she gets them. Many schools and day cares need this information before they let a child in. You can keep the list up to date by bringing it to your child's check-ups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9016177\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a benefit to delaying vaccines until my child gets a little older?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No! Some parents think it helps to let children get older than the recommended vaccination ages before giving them too many vaccines. The truth is, studies show that delaying vaccines could actually have downsides. For example, one study found that children who got their first MMR vaccine later than they were supposed to had a higher risk of fever-related seizures. The vaccine schedules doctors recommend have been carefully studied. Do not delay your child's vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482679165\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chickenpox (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whooping-cough-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whooping cough (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
