At current rates, approximately 6 percent of individuals will develop this malignancy in their lifetime. Approximately one-half of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer will die from it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of colorectal cancer can be reduced by screening, recommendations for which have been issued by several major medical organizations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, several protective factors have been identified, stimulating interest in primary prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among the protective agents are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A large and compelling body of research has shown that NSAIDs inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis. The evidence is diverse and is based upon animal models, epidemiologic data, intervention trials of NSAIDs in patients with familial polyposis, and, more recently, randomized controlled trials of aspirin and selective COX-2 inhibitors in humans.</p><p>This topic review will summarize the data supporting the potentially beneficial role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other NSAIDs for colorectal cancer, and discuss the potential clinical implications. The potential benefits of aspirin for the incidence and mortality of other cancers is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28801630\"><span class=\"h1\">COLORECTAL CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial human evidence of a potential role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> as a chemopreventive agent was somewhat serendipitous. A large case-control study of colorectal cancer published in 1988 explored numerous potential associations between various medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One of the unexpected findings was an inverse association between aspirin use and risk of colorectal cancer. The association persisted even when the investigators controlled for potential confounding factors, leading the authors to speculate that this inverse association could be causal.</p><p>A large number of subsequent studies of varying designs confirmed this association with both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These data have demonstrated a reduction in the risk of colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer in the range of 20 to 40 percent, depending in part upon the dose and duration of therapy and study design.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Systematic reviews</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analyses and systematic reviews suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use is associated with a decreased incidence of colonic adenomas, colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and death due to colorectal cancer.</p><p>One meta-analysis of controlled and observational studies reached the following conclusions regarding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> reduced the incidence of colonic adenomas in randomized controlled trials (relative risk [RR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.7-0.95), in case-control studies (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77-0.98), and in cohort studies (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.85).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cohort studies, regular use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> was associated with a 22 percent reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer. By contrast, two randomized controlled trials of low-dose aspirin did not show a protective effect during initial follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin trials'</a> below.) This difference may be related to the dose and duration of aspirin therapy. Benefits of aspirin in observational studies were more apparent when used in high doses and for periods longer than 10 years.</p><p/><p>Similar estimates were made in a later meta-analysis of four placebo-controlled trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk of recurrent adenomas was reduced by approximately 17 percent (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96), corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 6.7 percent (95% CI 3.2-10.2).</p><p>A separate systematic review, examining the evidence related to non-aspirin NSAIDs and colorectal cancer prevention, reached the following conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs were associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal adenomas in cohort studies (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.85) and case-control studies (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74).

In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials, patients who were cancer-free at study entry and received aspirin were less likely than controls to subsequently be diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A reduction in the number of patients with distant metastases at the time of diagnosis was also noted in a meta-analysis of 195 observational studies (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Cohort studies of aspirin use among patients with established colorectal cancer have also observed a survival benefit, particularly among those with COX-2 positive or PIK3CA mutant tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Mortality due to cancer was examined in a meta-analysis of 51 randomized trials that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It found that aspirin use was associated with a decrease in death from all cancers starting three years after the initiation of aspirin (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.96), including a decrease in deaths due to colorectal cancer (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.89). The meta-analysis of observational studies also showed a decrease in 20-year mortality due to colorectal cancer (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, these analyses excluded two large randomized trials that used alternate day dosing of aspirin (the Women&rsquo;s Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and the Physicians' Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]). Neither of these trials observed a reduced risk of colorectal cancer after 10 to 12 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, extended follow-up of the Women's Health Study did observe a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Of note, many of the controlled trials were carried out in patients with a history of colorectal neoplasia (either adenomas or cancer) and not in patients at average risk for adenoma development. At least two meta-analyses have been published which suggest that the risk of recurrent adenomas is reduced by about 13 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p>The following summarizes the major, controlled human trials looking at the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use on adenoma development:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized intervention trial supported a benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, especially at low doses (81 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> on recurrent adenoma risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The study included 1121 patients with a history of adenomas who were randomly assigned to aspirin (81 or 325 mg daily) or placebo. A follow-up colonoscopy was performed at least one year after study entry in 1084 patients (97 percent). The risk of recurrent adenomas was significantly lower in the 81 mg group compared with placebo (38 versus 47 percent, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.96). The risk reduction was even greater for the development of advanced neoplasms (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.92). For unclear reasons, the 325 mg dose was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of adenoma recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial focused on 517 patients with a history of colorectal cancer who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Recurrent adenomas were observed significantly less often in the aspirin group (17 versus 25 percent, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.91) during a colonoscopy performed at a median of 13 months after randomization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study included 272 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas who were randomly assigned to two doses of lysine acetylsalicylate (160 or 300 mg daily) or placebo for four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. After one year, the risk of recurrent adenomas at the planned study colonoscopy was significantly reduced in both active treatment groups (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.84 for the 300 mg dose; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.95 for the 160 mg dose). By contrast, after four years, neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> treatment group had a reduced risk of recurrent adenoma compared with the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The authors suggest that this may reflect a stronger influence of aspirin on missed polyps that are more likely to be seen at one year than de novo growth of new polyps that may become apparent at year four. Alternatively, the findings at year four may be due to methodological issues. Overall, protocol adherence was poor, with only 55 percent of the initial patients undergoing a year four protocol colonoscopy. Moreover, there was a disproportionately high drop-out rate in the placebo arm. This form of aspirin is not used in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fourth trial included 945 patients with a history of an adenoma who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (300 mg daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation (0.5 mg daily), or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Aspirin reduced the risk of recurrent adenoma (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of some of these trials found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> users had a pooled risk ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.72-0.96) for any adenoma and 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.90) for advanced adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the results of the four-year follow-up trial that showed no difference in adenoma recurrence rate had not yet been published at the time of the meta-analysis. Although many of these trials offer compelling evidence of causality, they have provided only limited and conflicting data regarding the optimal dose of aspirin for colorectal neoplasia prevention. One trial demonstrated that both 160 mg and 300 mg of daily soluble aspirin were effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; a second trial, which examined only one dose, showed that standard-dose aspirin (325 mg daily) reduced risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; and a third trial did not detect a reduction in adenoma recurrence in a group randomized to standard-dose aspirin, but did observe a moderate benefit in a group randomized to low-dose aspirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Among 133 evaluable patients with familial adenomatous polyposis in a randomized trial (CAPP1), 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> showed a trend toward a reduced polyp count (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.54-1.10) at a follow-up sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. For patients treated for more than one year, aspirin was associated with a significant reduction in polyp size (p = &#160;02).</p><p>Additional data on a range of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> doses are available from observational cohort studies. The Nurses' Health Study, for example, suggests that the benefit of aspirin on adenoma risk is highly dose-dependent, with the greatest benefit among participants who used the highest doses of aspirin (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36-0.65 in those who used more than 14 tablets per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar conclusions were reached in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which included 47,363 male health professionals observed for 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Regular, long-term aspirin use was associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer with maximal risk reduction also observed at doses greater than 14 tablets per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A dose relationship has been supported by other human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].</p><p>Trials focusing on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in the prevention of colorectal cancer have not been entirely consistent with those focusing on adenoma recurrence. The Physicians' Health Study, an intervention trial of aspirin at a dose of 325 mg every other day, failed to find a protective benefit of aspirin during five years of randomized follow-up and up to 18 years of non-randomized, observational follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/14,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33,34</a>].</p><p>Although the results seem at odds with some of the epidemiologic studies and the adenoma recurrence trials, they do not necessarily negate them. The duration of randomized treatment in the Physicians' Health Study was for only five years, while the results of studies that considered duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> intake suggest that longer observation is required to detect a significant reduction in colorectal cancer incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>]. This observation is consistent with the long latency underlying progression of normal tissue to adenoma to cancer.</p><p>The Women's Health Study, a large, placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> at a dose of 100 mg every other day, reported no reduction in colorectal cancer incidence after 10 years of treatment; however, after a median follow-up of 18 years, the risk of colorectal cancer was reduced in women taking aspirin (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.97). The reduced risk was primarily for proximal colon cancers (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>Further support of this hypothesis is a pooled secondary analysis of data from two large randomized trials (British Doctors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> Trial [BDAT] and UK-TIA Trial) of higher doses of aspirin originally designed to examine aspirin for the prevention of vascular disease. After long-term post-trial follow-up, use of between 300 and 1200 mg of aspirin was associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.97). However, this benefit was observed only after evaluating patients 10 years after randomization and was greatest 10 to 14 years after randomization among patients who had treatment for at least five years (RR 0.37, 0.20-0.70) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similarly, a lower risk of colorectal cancer was evident only after 10 years of use in the Nurses' Health Study and six years of use in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In the latter study, the benefit was no longer evident within four years of discontinuing aspirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>More recently, the pooled secondary analysis of the BDAT and UK-TIA trials was expanded with inclusion of two additional randomized trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (Swedish Aspirin Low Dose Trial and Dutch TIA Aspirin Trial) that were designed to assess the effect of aspirin use on vascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In total, the four trials included 14,033 patients with a median of 18 years follow-up. The 20-year risk of colon cancer was significantly reduced in patients who received aspirin (incidence HR 0.76, mortality HR 0.65) with benefit increasing with longer duration of treatment. Patients allocated to receive aspirin for five years or longer had an absolute risk reduction for colon cancer of approximately 70 percent. Doses of 75 mg daily appeared to be as effective as higher doses, although there were no individual trials that directly compared 75 mg with higher doses; very low doses of aspirin (30 mg daily) were ineffective. Contrary to most observational studies, the risk reduction with aspirin appeared to be confined to cancer of the proximal colon.</p><p>The only randomized placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (CAPP2) in which colorectal cancer was a primary endpoint found no benefit from aspirin (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> in 937 patients with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The reason for the negative results may be related to a distinct pathway of carcinogenesis in Lynch patients. Another possible explanation is that the study follow-up was only two to four years (median 29 months), which may have been too brief to detect a benefit of aspirin. In support of this explanation, a planned double-blinded, post-intervention follow-up of patients enrolled in CAPP2 (median 56 months) found a marginal nonsignificant reduction in colorectal cancer incidence in an intent-to-treat analysis. However, in a per protocol analysis of patients treated with 600 mg aspirin per day for at least two years, there was a significant reduction in colorectal cancer incidence. Moreover, in a secondary analysis, there was a decreased rate of overall Lynch cancers in the group treated with aspirin for at least two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

While studies have generally not provided precise estimates of the amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> used, some evidence indicates that moderate doses (such as those used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease) and even alternate day low dose aspirin are sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>].

Although clinical trials suggest a benefit to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use within three years on adenoma recurrence, an effect on cancer incidence appears to require much longer use. An analysis from the Nurses' Health Study showed that at least 10 years of regular aspirin use may be necessary to achieve substantial reductions in risk of colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Furthermore, it appears that risk reduction requires consistent use. In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a benefit from aspirin was no longer evident four years after discontinuing use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Uncertainty remains regarding the duration required to produce a benefit.

From a clinical perspective, all potential risks and benefits of prolonged aspirin use must be carefully weighed before recommending aspirin use for disease prevention.

Such a subgroup would likely include individuals with established colorectal cancer that have undergone a resection for curative intent. Although such patients generally enjoy a favorable prognosis compared with patients diagnosed with unresectable disease, they remain at high risk of recurrence and death from the disease. In an observational study of 1279 patients with established Stage I, II, and III colorectal cancers, use of aspirin after the diagnosis of colorectal cancer was associated with improved survival from the disease. Compared with non-users, participants who regularly used aspirin after diagnosis had a 29 percent reduction in colorectal cancer-specific mortality and a 21 percent reduction in overall mortality. Regular aspirin use after diagnosis was associated with a particularly low risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality among participants whose primary tumors overexpressed COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a> induced p21 expression, which is associated with cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhibition of cyclooxygenase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another possible mechanism by which NSAIDs might prevent colon cancer is inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes, which catalyze prostaglandin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. Early studies observed higher levels of prostaglandins in colorectal tumors compared with normal tissue. Subsequent reports demonstrated that prostaglandins were associated with tumor angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and inhibition of immune surveillance and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>In addition, studies in human colon cancer showed increased COX-2 expression when compared to the adjacent colonic mucosa; similar observations have been made in experimental models of colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>]. In two large prospective cohorts, the protective effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> appeared to be confined to colorectal cancers that overexpressed COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/12,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,94</a>]. These data support the hypothesis that aspirin exerts its effect on the formation of adenomas and cancers by inhibiting COX-2 or its downstream effectors.</p><p>COX-2 expression may also increase the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells and possibly influence patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/95-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-97</a>]. In one study, for example, COX-2 expression was determined in 76 patients with a variety of stages of colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Ten-year survival was significantly higher in patients with the lowest levels of COX-2 staining (68 versus 35 percent). These findings suggest that COX-2 activation may promote tumor growth. Consistent with this hypothesis is a study in which human colon cancer cells that expressed high levels of COX-2 were implanted into nude mice; treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduced tumor formation by 85 to 90 percent and inhibited colony formation of cultured cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. This benefit was not seen with tumor cells that lacked COX-2.</p><p>There may also be an interaction between COX-2 inhibition and the induction of apoptosis. In one report, the ras mutation (found in 50 percent of colorectal carcinomas) made rat intestinal epithelial cells more resistant to spontaneous apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. The ras-transformed cells also had increased expression of COX-2. Administration of a COX-2 selective antagonist inhibited the growth of these cells by both inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. However, in another study, a different COX-2 selective antagonist induced apoptosis in a colorectal cancer cell line that lacked detectable COX-2 expression, suggesting that COX-2 selective NSAIDs may induce apoptosis via mechanisms that do not involve COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>There is also growing evidence that COX-2 inhibition may influence epidermal growth factor receptor expression (EGFR). COX-2-derived prostaglandins activate EGFR signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. Animal models have demonstrated an association between the EGFR pathway and the development of intestinal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>].</p><p>Cyclooxygenase inhibition may also exert its effect via a pathway mediated by prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 is a potent stimulator of cultured colon cancer cells via a G-protein-coupled receptor leading to accumulation of beta-catenin (which stimulates cell proliferation) in the nucleus. Thus, NSAIDs may exert a beneficial effect by decreasing production of prostaglandin E2 and leading to increased degradation CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9,104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,104,105</a>]. Through COX-independent pathways, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> also induces phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of CTNNB1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>]. In support of a potential effect of aspirin in cancer that is mediated by disruption of the CTNNB1 and <em>Wnt</em> signaling pathway is a study demonstrating that the association of aspirin with lower risk of colorectal cancer is not evident among individuals who do not have at least one allele of the SNP rs6983267 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. This SNP, which has been shown in genome-wide association studies to be associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer, functionally appears to be associated with weaker binding of CTNNB1 to transcription factors associated with expression of the <em>MYC</em> oncogene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>Much of the focus of experimental evidence on the mechanism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and NSAIDs on carcinogenesis has focused on blockade of COX-2, which generally requires higher doses of aspirin and NSAIDs. However, the finding that relatively low doses of daily aspirin typically used for prevention of atherothrombosis may also be associated with lower risk of death from cancers has supported a hypothesis that aspirin may mediate additional anti-cancer mechanisms through inhibition of COX-1 present in platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Platelet COX-1 activity may generate lipid mediators, such as thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin E2, and the release of stored proteins, such as growth and angiogenic factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619092567\"><span class=\"h2\">Other mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other mechanisms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/NSAIDs</span> relevant to carcinogenesis continue to be uncovered. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a> decreases the number of aberrant crypt foci in the colon (which may be precursors of adenomas and cancer), possibly by inhibition of pathways that activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>]. In addition, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NSAIDs inhibit angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/113-116\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-116</a>], and may modulate insulin-related neoplastic pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Finally, mutations in the <em>BRAF</em> oncogene are observed in 10 to 15 percent of colorectal cancers, which constitutively activate the <span class=\"nowrap\">RAF/MAPK</span> signaling. In human studies, aspirin was associated with a lower risk of <em>BRAF</em>-wild-type colorectal cancers but not <em>BRAF</em>-mutated cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-role-in-prevention-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].
