It has been reported to occur in 1 in 3000 to 10,000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299648\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In very early pregnancy, the uterus is retroverted (retroflexed) in up to 20 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As the uterus enlarges during the first trimester, the fundus normally rises from the hollow of the sacrum to an anterior ventral position, spontaneously correcting any retroversion. In rare cases, however, the fundus becomes wedged below the sacral promontory, where it continues to enlarge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Concomitantly, the cervix becomes displaced cephalad against or above the symphysis pubis and pushes against the urethra and bladder, which interferes with normal voiding.</p><p>Eventually, the posterior pelvis becomes too small to accommodate the increasing size of the fundus; this typically occurs when the pregnancy progresses beyond 20 weeks of gestation. At this point, the anterior lower uterine wall begins to thin and balloon into the upper abdomen, developing a sacculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is termed &quot;inverted polarity&quot; because the anterior lower uterine wall becomes cephalad to the fundus, which is posterior-caudal. Concomitantly, both the bladder and the cervix are pulled up into the abdominal cavity, towards the umbilicus. The cervix can stretch to 10 cm or more in length, such that the internal os becomes located above the symphysis pubis, and occasionally above the bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299734\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that may inhibit the fundus of the enlarging uterus from ascending out of the sacral hollow include: adhesions related to previous pelvic surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, or endometriosis; large fibroids; uterine malformation; or a deep sacral concavity with an overhanging promontory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laxity of the supporting tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Incarceration can also occur in the absence of predisposing factors, but this is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41499271\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, the patient presents at 14 to 16 weeks of gestation with symptoms, often vague, related to pressure on the anatomic structures adjacent to the entrapped enlarging uterus. The most common symptoms are pain and progressive difficulty voiding. The pain may be abdominal, suprapubic, or in the back; or may be limited to pelvic discomfort or a feeling of pelvic fullness. Urinary symptoms include frequency, dysuria, sensation of incomplete emptying, dribbling small volumes due to overflow incontinence, and, often, urinary retention. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as rectal pressure, tenesmus, and worsening constipation may occur due to compression of the rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Vaginal bleeding has also been described. Symptoms can be intermittent, resolving for a period of time and then returning weeks later.</p><p>Initial presentation in the third trimester is rare; only a few dozen cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cases of asymptomatic uterine incarceration are even rarer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. </p><p>Symptomatic retroversion with bladder outlet obstruction may first occur postpartum due to uterine enlargement combined with flaccid supporting tissues and other unknown factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41499667\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key finding on physical examination is severe anterior displacement of the cervix behind the pubic symphysis, such that the clinician may not be able to visualize the cervix with a speculum or palpate the external os on pelvic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the vagina is angulated anteriorly and a large, soft, smooth, nontender mass (the incarcerated uterus) fills the cul-de-sac. </p><p>Initially, the uterus may be difficult to palpate abdominally, and later in pregnancy the fundal height may lag behind that expected for gestational age. The abdomen may appear full or distended due to an overdistended bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36765994\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging can be a useful adjunct when the clinical presentation is suggestive of incarcerated uterus. Characteristic imaging features allow definitive diagnosis of incarcerated uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41499621\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first half of pregnancy, the cervix may be obscured or appear thin and elongated, and pulled anterior to the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F85819\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85819 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83558\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83558 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Difficulty identifying the cervix should raise suspicion for uterine incarceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The bladder is displaced superiorly and elongated from compression by the cervix and uterus &#160; The fundus is located in the hollow of the sacrum; as a result, a fundal placenta may be mistaken for a placenta previa. The fetus may be seen posteriorly against the sacrum deep in the pelvis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H300081\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On magnetic resonance imaging, the fundus is below the sacral promontory, the cervix in a cephalad and ventral position, and the vagina displaced almost parallel to the dorsal spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings midpregnancy include a &quot;free-standing,&quot; T-shaped multi-layer myometrium on sagittal images, and a small cleft-like cystic lesion between the bladder and the sacculation on axial images, corresponding to the elongated cervix and the caudal part of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, there is an asymmetrical thickening of the posterior uterine wall. The anterior wall appears much thinner than the posterior wall because of sacculation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41500140\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cephalad displacement of the cervix and upper vagina lifts the bladder neck and compresses the urethra, frequently causing urinary retention, sometimes with hydronephrosis. Urinary retention can lead to urinary tract infection and, rarely, bladder rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The ureters can also be compressed between the incarcerated gravid uterus and the psoas muscles. In a 1894 review, Gottschalk described 67 cases of incarcerated sacculated uterus resulting in uremia, sepsis, peritonitis, and ultimately maternal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a 2014 case report in which the presenting symptom of uterine incarceration was urinary retention at 17 weeks, the patient went on to develop hypertension <span class=\"nowrap\">(170/110</span> mmHg), renal insufficiency (creatinine 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> and severe lower leg edema that impaired ambulation before the uterus was disimpacted at 23 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Malposition of the uterus can also compromise uterine arterial blood flow, increasing the risk of decidual bleeding, miscarriage, oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction, and fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The rate of second trimester pregnancy loss has been reported to be as high as 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. There also appears to be increased risks of premature rupture of membranes and preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Other complications described in case reports include uterine wall necrosis, uterine rupture, development of a cervicovaginal fistula, and rectal gangrene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Compression of pelvic veins may promote thrombosis, resulting in postpartum pulmonary embolism in the absence of thrombosis in the deep veins of the lower limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Dystocia during labor inevitably occurs. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of incarcerated uterus is based on characteristic findings on physical and ultrasound examination after the first trimester: severe anterior displacement of the cervix and the uterus filling the posterior pelvis below the sacral promontory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57272%7EOBGYN%2F82473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57272 graphicRef82473 \">figure 1A-B</a>).</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging with either T1- or T2-weighted images can be useful in confirming uterine incarceration in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, especially later in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>] (see <a href=\"#H300081\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above). It also clarifies anatomic relationships, which can be severely distorted. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differential diagnosis of the physical findings includes a pelvic or adnexal mass extending into the cul-de-sac (eg, extrauterine pregnancy, adnexal torsion, appendiceal abscess), a posterior fibroid, and some uterine anomalies (eg, uterus didelphys, unconnected rudimentary horn) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These conditions can often be excluded by ultrasound examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful when anatomic findings are uncertain on ultrasound imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because this condition is rare, particularly late in pregnancy, options for management are based on the approaches described in case reports. Thus, it is impossible to quantify the risk to the pregnancy from these procedures, but it is probably low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Incarceration before 20 weeks of gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis and treatment before 20 weeks of gestation are important for successful management of uterine incarceration. When a retroverted uterus is noted during the first trimester, bimanual examination should be repeated at 16 weeks to determine whether the fundus has ascended into the abdominal cavity. </p><p>If the uterus remains retroverted, intervention is indicated for relief of maternal symptoms, if present. Even in the absence of symptoms, we suggest correction between 16 and 20 weeks to prevent development of complications related to incarceration. Many techniques have been utilized for freeing the uterus: the simplest maneuvers should be attempted first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Passive reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The woman is instructed to empty her bladder and assume the knee-chest position for 10 minutes at least three times per day for one week. If spontaneous voiding is impaired, a catheter is placed to decompress the bladder. </p><p>Although described in the literature, this approach is unlikely to be successful in symptomatic cases. If it fails to relieve the incarceration within one week, manual reduction is attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Manual reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manual reduction can be attempted in the office or performed in a setting where conscious sedation or regional or general anesthesia can be administered if pain management is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Disadvantages of anesthesia are that it precludes use of some maternal positions and removes pain as a sign of excessive force during the reduction. Some clinicians administer a tocolytic drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>) before the procedure to relax the uterus. </p><p>After emptying her bladder, the patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with her feet in stirrups. The clinician uses <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> fingertips to apply mild to moderate cephalad pressure to the uterine fundus through the posterior fornix until it is released from the cul-de-sac; a finger in the rectum can also be used to apply pressure. If these maneuvers are unsuccessful, the patient is placed in knee-chest (Sims) or all fours position and the procedure is repeated. </p><p>A ring forceps can be applied to the cervix and gently pulled toward the introitus to provide countertraction while the fundus is being pushed cephalad. Use of sonographic guidance during manipulation of the uterus may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>If the initial attempt at correction fails, these maneuvers can be repeated in one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Colonoscopic reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A colonoscope can be used to reduce uterine incarceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>]. In one report, five gravid patients with an incarcerated uterus refractory to manual reduction underwent a simple bowel prep with one to two enemas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Under conscious sedation, a colonoscope was passed through the sigmoid colon to above the level of the uterine fundus with the woman lying in a left lateral decubitus position. The investigators hypothesized that as the flexible colonoscope passed through the rectum to the proximal descending colon, forming a loop while advancing through the sigmoid colon, it generated sufficient external forces to dislodge the uterus from beneath the sacral promontory. In this small series, all of the procedures were successful and uncomplicated, although one patient required a second procedure because of recurrent incarceration. </p><p>A second series described four cases of incarcerated uterus between the 15<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> week of gestation; three underwent successful manual reposition by colonoscopic insufflation without complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The authors hypothesized that air insufflation during the procedure together with the formation of the loop had a synergistic effect by creating anterior pressure through the wall of the rectum on the uterine fundus, thus facilitating the manual reposition.</p><p>Colonoscopy should only be performed by an experienced endoscopist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Release of the incarcerated uterus can be approached laparoscopically under general anesthesia. After pneumoperitoneum is achieved, vaginal maneuvers for manual reduction are again attempted. If unsuccessful, the round ligaments are grasped with atraumatic instruments by an assistant and pulled to free the fundus, concurrently with manual pressure on the fundus from below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-surgery-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299877\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparotomy is rarely needed. However, if incarceration is due to the presence of dense adhesions, treatment must be individualized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36766070\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-reduction care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A postprocedure ultrasound examination is useful to confirm uterine position and fetal well-being. Once the uterus is freed, it almost always remains in the correct abdominal location without further support; however, some authors suggest placing a Hodge pessary in the vagina for five to seven days to help ensure that the uterus maintains its upright anterior position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Incarceration after 20 weeks of gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is generally recommended that reduction be avoided if the diagnosis of uterine incarceration is made after 20 weeks of gestation and the patient is asymptomatic or has only mild symptoms. Attempts at uterine release in the second half of pregnancy are unlikely to be successful and can cause serious complications (eg, pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>]), although at least one successful case has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Spontaneous resolution rarely occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In persistent cases, the pregnancy is monitored for preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, oligohydramnios, and fetal growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one report, only 21 percent reached term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Urinary retention commonly occurs and is treated by self-catheterization, if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>]. Otherwise, an indwelling catheter is placed.</p><p>Analgesia can be provided as a comfort measure to enable prolongation of the pregnancy. Severe pain may be indicative of a significant complication, such as uterine wall necrosis, impending uterine rupture, or rectal gangrene, and thus may require prompt laparotomy. On the other hand, case reports have described sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain in the third trimester related to spontaneous resolution of the incarceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Displacement of the cervix impedes normal progression of labor and increases the risk of intrapartum uterine rupture; vaginal delivery is always contraindicated when the uterus is incarcerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. </p><p>For the very rare cases that persist to the third trimester, we suggest cesarean delivery at 36 weeks of gestation to avoid exposing the uterus to labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. We do not test amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity because, in our opinion, the risk of labor and uterine rupture at this point exceeds potential prematurity-related risks.</p><p>Anatomical relationships at cesarean delivery are severely distorted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. The anatomic posterior uterine wall may be located ventrally. The bladder, vagina, and elongated cervix are stretched ventrally and cephalad, thus if the surgeon makes the uterine incision where the lower uterine segment is normally located, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> can transect the bladder, cervix, or vagina, resulting in supracervical hysterectomy. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging provides detailed images of the pelvic anatomy, and thus may facilitate surgical planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>].</p><p>We suggest a vertical supraumbilical skin incision, rather than a low vertical or Pfannenstiel incision. It can be extended caudally after entering the peritoneal cavity, if needed to allow adequate exposure of the distorted anatomy. The uterus should not be incised before the anatomic relationships are ascertained and restored to normal, if possible, by mobilization of the uterus from the pelvic cavity. In preterm gestations, where there is still a relatively large amount of amniotic fluid present, amnioreduction by amniocentesis may facilitate repositioning of the uterus. </p><p>If the fundus cannot be released and restored to its correct position, the uterine incision should be made as cephalad as possible on the anterior wall of the uterus, where the uterus bends back on itself, so as not to enter the bladder, vagina, or cervix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENCE RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incarcerated-gravid-uterus/abstract/4,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28</a>]. Persistence of predisposing conditions, such as uterine abnormalities or pelvic adhesions, may confer a higher risk of recurrence.
