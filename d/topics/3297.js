The majority of these tumors (85 percent) are adenocarcinomas arising from the ductal epithelium.

However, only 15 to 20 percent of patients have resectable disease at initial diagnosis; the majority have either locally advanced or metastatic cancer.</p><p>The use of chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be reviewed here. Multimodality management for locally advanced disease, specific methods for symptom palliation, and management of patients with metastatic islet cell (endocrine) tumors are discussed separately.

Despite this, single-agent chemotherapy trials in pancreatic cancer have commonly used objective response as a primary endpoint. This endpoint is likely more accurate for assessment of liver and other metastatic disease sites than it is for assessing the primary tumor.</p><p>Many trials have permitted patients with both locally advanced and metastatic disease to enroll, perhaps leading to an underestimation of response rates.

While intriguing, these data are preliminary, and it is premature to conclude that genomic testing can be used to screen gemcitabine-responsive individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3766007044\"><span class=\"h2\">Surrogate endpoints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, overall survival has been considered the gold standard indicator of benefit from anticancer treatment, particular treatment that is delivered with curative intent. Increasingly, treatments for advanced cancer, including pancreatic cancer, are being approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints, such as clinical benefit response rate, decrease in the tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), and progression-free survival (PFS), which correlate with overall survival. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618811757\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical benefit response rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A phase II study of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> in patients refractory to FU suggested that patients who lacked an objective response to treatment often had improvement in symptoms (ie, pain, weight loss) and performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The percentage of patients who derived clinical benefit from therapy was almost threefold higher than the fraction that had an objective antitumor response (11 versus 27 percent). This study led to the approval of single-agent gemcitabine for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer and changed the paradigm used to assess efficacy by defining symptom control as a beneficial endpoint for evaluating treatments in this disease. These data are discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1348684821\" class=\"local\">'Gemcitabine'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768276056\"><span class=\"h3\">CA 19-9 level</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many studies of patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer, there has been a correlation between duration of patient survival and decline in levels of the tumor marker CA 19-9 (also called cancer antigen 19-9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/22-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-28</a>]. The magnitude of marker reduction that best predicts improved outcomes (any reduction, &gt;50 percent reduction, &gt;75 percent reduction, &gt;89 percent reduction) is not clear.</p><p>Furthermore, whether decreases in serum CA 19-9 can act as a reliable surrogate for survival in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer has been called into question by others. As an example, in a series of 175 patients who were assessable for tumor marker response during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, an early 50 percent or greater decrease in CA 19-9 levels after the first eight weeks of therapy was not associated with a significant prolongation of survival compared with lesser degrees of CA 19-9 response (median 10.1 versus 8.6 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The short time frame of CA 19-9 assessment (after eight weeks of therapy) may have contributed to these negative results. Among patients who enter complete remission from chemotherapy, tumor marker normalization is a gradual process, with an estimated half-life of 15 to 33 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>A 2006 expert panel on tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancer convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) concluded that the data are insufficient to recommend the use of serum CA 19-9 levels alone for monitoring response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The panel recommended that CA 19-9 levels be measured at the start of treatment and then every one to three months during therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. Suspected disease progression based upon rising CA 19-9 levels should be confirmed radiographically.</p><p>CA 19-9 requires the presence of the Lewis blood group antigen (a glycosyl transferase) to be expressed. Among individuals with a Lewis-negative phenotype (an estimated 5 to 10 percent of the population), CA 19-9 levels are not a useful tumor marker.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3597965669\"><span class=\"h3\">PFS, response rate, and disease control rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that assessment of overall survival as a treatment endpoint can be confounded by second-line treatments, increasingly PFS is accepted as a surrogate for treatment benefit in the setting of advanced disease. PFS, objective response rate, and disease control rate (DCR; which includes objective responses and stable disease) are commonly used endpoints in oncology drug development. A systematic review of 24 randomized, controlled, first-line chemotherapy trials that included 10,708 patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer came to the following conclusions regarding the use of PFS, response rate, or DCR as a surrogate endpoint for overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Pearson correlation coefficient between overall survival and PFS was 0.86 (95% CI 0.67-0.94, p&lt;0.001). Sensitivity analysis of the studies with little or no crossover further showed a correlation coefficient of 0.91 (95% CI 0.76-0.97, p&lt;0.001). The strong correlation between PFS and overall survival may be explained by the aggressive nature of advanced pancreatic cancer, which is known to have a short survival after progression on first-line therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The correlation coefficient was weaker between objective response rate and overall survival (0.45, 95% CI 0.07-0.72, p = 0.02), but it was stronger between DCR and overall survival (0.74, 95% CI 0.38-0.90, p&lt;0.001).</p><p/><p>These results suggest that PFS is a robust surrogate for overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer, that response rate should not be used as a surrogate measure to predict overall survival, and that DCR may stand as a more reliable surrogate than response rate. Compared with two prior meta-analyses investigating surrogates of overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], this study showed a stronger correlation coefficient between overall survival and PFS, and a strong correlation with DCR, which had not been shown previously. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2036384803\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H822699326\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2643681096\"><span class=\"h3\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multiphasic computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed to assess disease extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other staging studies should be performed only as dictated by symptoms.
