Nocardiosis is typically regarded as an opportunistic infection, but approximately one-third of infected patients are immunocompetent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Two characteristics of nocardiosis are its ability to disseminate to virtually any organ, particularly the central nervous system, and its tendency to relapse or progress despite appropriate therapy.</p><p>The treatment of nocardiosis will be reviewed here. The microbiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of nocardiosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-nocardiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of nocardiosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-nocardiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of nocardiosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported antimicrobial susceptibility patterns have varied among different studies, countries, and <em>Nocardia</em> species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F113882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113882 \">table 1</a>). In a retrospective review of 765 isolates submitted voluntarily to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1995 and 2004, 42 percent were resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) and 61 percent were resistant to sulfamethoxazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This incidence of resistance is significantly higher than in other reports. There are limitations to this study, with the authors concluding that the presented data are probably not representative of all United States cases. As an example, patients who were not responding to treatment due to resistance may have been more likely to have had their isolates sent to the CDC than patients with susceptible isolates who were responding to treatment.</p><p>In contrast, in a study of 552 clinical isolates collected from six major medical referral centers in the United States between 2005 and 2011, which was prompted by the unexpected results of the CDC study, only 2 percent of isolates were resistant to TMP-SMX <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sulfamethoxazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between these results and the results of the CDC study are that there might have been differences in the preparation of samples <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the interpretation of results of in vitro susceptibility testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Other studies have shown similar results to the study of 552 clinical isolates described above. Among 138 <em>Nocardia</em> isolates collected in Taiwan between 1998 and 2009, only 2 percent were resistant to TMP-SMX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A study of 28 cases from Switzerland reported that 16 percent of <em>Nocardia</em> isolates were resistant to TMP-SMX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Given that some isolates are resistant to TMP-SMX, formal antimicrobial susceptibility testing is <strong>always</strong> necessary to ensure optimal antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Molecular methods used to identify <em>Nocardia</em> species have resulted in the reclassification and renaming of many isolates. For example, <em>Nocardia</em> isolates that in the past were identified as <em>N. asteroides</em> complex have now been reclassified to other, or new, species and, because of this, <em>N. asteroides</em> is now rarely encountered. Awareness of such changes is important in the interpretation and use of susceptibility results from past reports when non-molecular methods of speciation were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

A study of the in vitro activity of various antibiotics against 51 <em>Nocardia</em> isolates from more than 10 <em>Nocardia</em> species found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> was fourfold less active than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> and that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a> was 16-fold less active than imipenem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, other data suggest that meropenem has better activity than imipenem against some <em>Nocardia</em> species but confirm decreased activity against <em>N. farcinica</em> and <em>N. nova </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>All of the <em>Nocardia</em> species described above are susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/6,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,23</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> has activity against some isolates, but use of oral agents is limited to cutaneous disease in immunocompetent hosts and to suppressive therapy following induction therapy of severe infection.</p><p>There are reports of in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>. In one study that included 186 <em>Nocardia</em> isolates, 96 percent of 55 <em>N. nova</em> isolates were susceptible to clarithromycin, but, with many other <em>Nocardia</em> species, the percentage of susceptible isolates was less than 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study, 87 percent of 17 <em>Nocardia</em> isolates, including all 16 <em>N. nova</em> isolates, were susceptible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No prospective randomized trials have determined the most effective therapy for nocardiosis. In addition, it is unlikely that such trials will ever be performed since a large number of patients with similar clinical manifestations would be required. Two hallmarks of nocardiosis are its relative rarity and the diversity of the clinical presentation in different patients. Thus, the choice of antimicrobials is based upon cumulative retrospective experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], investigations in animal models, and in vitro antimicrobial activity profiles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to antimicrobial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical isolates of <em>Nocardia</em> spp are variably resistant to antibiotics. As a result, we recommend empiric coverage with two or three agents in patients with severe infection, as defined below. Cutaneous infection in an immunocompetent host can be treated with monotherapy.</p><p>Most authorities recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) as part of first-line therapy for nocardiosis. If the patient is allergic to sulfonamides, desensitization should be performed when possible. If this is not appropriate or if the patient is intolerant of sulfonamides, then alternative agents should be chosen based upon susceptibility studies of the clinical isolate, if available. The approach to patients with sulfonamide allergies is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfonamide-allergy-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfonamide allergy in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sulfonamides have been considered the standard of therapy for more than 50 years, despite the lack of controlled comparative data. This consensus is based in part upon the results of a few retrospective reviews in which there was a trend toward increased survival in nocardiosis with the use of sulfonamide-containing regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As noted above, if the patient is allergic to sulfonamides, desensitization should be performed when possible. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Approach to antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Although all sulfonamides appear to be equally efficacious, TMP-SMX is considered by most clinicians to be the drug of choice. Dosing recommendations are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Isolated cutaneous infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H683290415\" class=\"local\">'Mycetoma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial intravenous therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Switch to oral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Some <em>Nocardia</em> spp are less susceptible or resistant to this regimen by in vitro susceptibility testing. Nevertheless, there have been few reports of patients failing to respond to TMP-SMX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic susceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients who develop <em>Nocardia</em> infection while taking low-dose TMP-SMX for <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia prophylaxis, the majority of their isolates remain susceptible to TMP-SMX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, in a study of 35 solid organ transplant recipients with <em>Nocardia</em> infection, 24 (69 percent) were receiving prophylactic TMP-SMX (most at a dose of 1 single-strength tablet three times a week), and all breakthrough infections except one involved isolates that were susceptible to TMP-SMX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Furthermore, many of the breakthrough infections were treated successfully with combination regimens that included TMP-SMX. In this setting, it is reasonable to use TMP-SMX as part of empiric combination therapy while awaiting susceptibility results. Appropriate combination regimens are discussed in greater detail below and are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56194 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Severe infection'</a> below.)</p><p>TMP-SMX has demonstrated synergy against <em>Nocardia</em> in several in vitro studies; the optimal ratio of TMP to SMX in vitro ranges from 1 to &le;5 to a ratio of 1 to 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, controversy exists over the optimal synergistic ratio in vivo and whether this ratio should be achieved in the serum or tissues.</p><p>Commercial preparations contain a ratio of TMP to SMX of 1:5. Following administration, the ratio achieved is usually 1:20 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and approximately 1:7 in tissues, pus, and cerebral nocardial abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. There is evidence that TMP-SMX is synergistic against <em>Nocardia</em> at a wide range of ratios, including the 1:20 ratio achieved in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. It has not been demonstrated that the TMP component adds clinical benefit over a sulfonamide alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>TMP-SMX has the additional benefits of excellent penetration into most tissue compartments, including the central nervous system (CNS), and high serum concentrations after oral administration. TMP-SMX is the only parenteral sulfonamide currently available in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Other agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the success of TMP-SMX in the treatment of nocardiosis, combination therapy with other agents is warranted in patients with severe infections. These drugs are also indicated in patients with sulfonamide intolerance or allergy and documented clinical treatment failures. The choice of agent varies with susceptibility testing and with known patterns of response with different <em>Nocardia</em> spp. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic susceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p>In vitro susceptibilities and animal models of disease have demonstrated activity against <em>Nocardia</em> with a variety of antibiotics, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, third-generation cephalosporins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, extended spectrum fluoroquinolones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/22,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,33-35</a>]. Several anecdotal reports indicate that these agents are successful in treating patients with nocardiosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. There are a few reports of successful treatment of <em>N. nova</em> infections using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> either as a single agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] or as part of a combination regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Although limited clinical experience suggests efficacy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, even as monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], the use of linezolid for more than two weeks is associated with substantial risk of hematologic toxicity, particularly thrombocytopenia, as well as neurotoxicity (eg, peripheral neuropathy, serotonin syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nocardiosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Given the length of treatment recommended for nocardiosis (usually 6 to 12 months), linezolid seems unlikely to become widely used in this setting. However, because of its broad activity against various <em>Nocardia</em> species and its excellent CNS penetration, it could be considered early in severe infection as a short-term option and as a part of an initial combination with close monitoring for adverse effects.
