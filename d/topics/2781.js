On both steps 2 and 3, the use of acetaminophen or an NSAID could be considered, as well as other drugs to enhance analgesia or treat side effects.</p><p/><p>The analgesic ladder approach is not an evidence-based guideline, but it provides a framework for the stepwise and systematic approach to managing cancer pain.

In addition, for patients who begin therapy with an opioid alone, a trial of fixed-schedule dosing with acetaminophen may be considered in those who have mild residual pain during opioid therapy, particularly if the patient is very sensitive to opioid side effects. However, severe liver damage may result from taking too much acetaminophen, and the treatment of pain that worsens over time cannot be accomplished with these drugs because the amount of opioid that can be delivered is limited by the amount of acetaminophen in each dose. When the maximum dose of acetaminophen is reached, an alternative strategy for pain control is needed.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> has been used alone for mild pain.

In the United States, concerns about unintentional overdose have been rising, and government regulators have suggested that when patients are taking a combination product containing an opioid and acetaminophen, that the maximum single dose should be limited to 650 mg, the maximal total daily dose be limited to no more than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for adults, and that patients with significant liver disease or heavy alcohol use should be considered to have a relative contraindication to this drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-use-of-acetaminophen-and-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

There are two main isoforms of COX, a constitutive form (COX-1) that is active in tissues that require prostaglandins for physiologic function, and an inducible form (COX-2) that is produced in the setting of inflammation.</p><p>Each of the NSAIDs inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, but with varying selectively for the two isoforms. Drugs that are relatively more selective for COX-2 have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, but are relatively less likely to produce side effects related to COX-1 inhibition, such as gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of drugs were specifically developed as relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors in order to reduce the risk of GI toxicity. Studies confirmed that these COX-2 selective drugs had lower rates of GI side effects, ulceration and bleeding, as long as low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy was not undertaken concurrently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;, section on 'Effect of low-dose aspirin'</a>.)</p><p>Cardiovascular toxicity has been identified in patients treated with any of the NSAIDs, and epidemiologic and other research has suggested that the prothrombotic effect that presumably causes this toxicity is produced by relatively excessive inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme. Mostly as a result of these concerns, two COX-2 selective NSAIDs were taken off the market in the United States, and others have not been approved. Subsequent research has confirmed that there is large drug-specific variation in the risk of cardiovascular toxicity among both the COX-2 selective drugs and the non-selective <span class=\"nowrap\">COX-1/COX-2</span> inhibitors. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Celecoxib</a>, currently the only available NSAID labeled a selective COX-2 inhibitor in the US, appears to have a far lower risk than other drugs in this class; similarly, some of the non-selective drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, appear to have relatively lower risk.

There is slightly more evidence to support additive analgesic benefit from the combination of an NSAID plus an opioid than there is with combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> plus an opioid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-use-of-acetaminophen-and-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. A 2017 Cochrane review included 11 randomized trials comparing different NSAIDS (eight trials) or a step III opioid with or without an NSAID (three trials); there were no trials comparing an NSAID with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-pain-management-use-of-acetaminophen-and-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Initially moderate or severe pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in four studies (totaling 415 participants), with a range of estimates between 26 and 51 percent in individual studies. All of the studies were at high risk of bias for lack of blinding, incomplete outcomes data, or small size. Common adverse events with NSAIDs were <span class=\"nowrap\">thirst/dry</span> mouth (15 percent), loss of appetite (14 percent), somnolence, and dyspepsia (11 percent each). The authors concluded that there was no high-quality evidence to support or refute the benefit of NSAIDs, either alone or in combination with opioids, for any severity of cancer pain; there was very low-quality evidence that some patients with moderate to severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of benefit within one or two weeks.</p><p>Based upon clinical observations, NSAIDs may be especially useful in patients with bone pain or pain that is related to grossly inflammatory lesions.

Nevertheless, in general, GI risk correlates with antiinflammatory activity, and those NSAIDs whose analgesic and antiinflammatory doses are similar (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piroxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piroxicam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>) pose a greater risk, and should probably be avoided. In addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, limited data suggest that some nonselective NSAIDs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabumetone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabumetone</a>, and the nonacetylated salicylates such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choline-magnesium-trisalicylate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">choline magnesium trisalicylate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salsalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salsalate</a>) have a relatively lower risk of GI toxicity.

Taking the drug with food <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antacids may also improve GI tolerance.</p><p>Pharmacologic approaches to preventing gastroduodenal toxicity include the concurrent use of a gastroprotectant (eg, a proton pump inhibitor [PPI] such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>, or the prostaglandin analogue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>).

However, there are conflicting data on this issue. Nevertheless, selection of naproxen is reasonable in a patient who is otherwise eligible for a trial of NSAID therapy if there is a relatively high concern about gastrointestinal or prothrombotic effects.

In addition to risk-related factors, there may be other important considerations as specific drugs are considered. For example, a past response to an NSAID may inform current drug selection. Pharmacokinetic considerations may also be important, in that an NSAID that can be given once daily (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabumetone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabumetone</a>) or twice daily (many options) is usually better for fixed schedule, open-ended dosing.

Analgesia may be additive to that of opioids, permitting a reduction in the opioid dose, with a consequent lessening of opioid-related side effects. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of combination products that include an opioid plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (acetaminophen plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>) is a reasonable alternative to low doses of a strong opioid alone for opioid-naive patients with moderate to severe cancer pain. In addition, for patients who begin therapy with an opioid alone, a trial of fixed-schedule dosing with acetaminophen may be considered in those who have mild residual pain during opioid therapy, particularly if the patient is very sensitive to opioid side effects. However, severe liver damage may result from taking too much acetaminophen, and the treatment of pain that worsens over time cannot be accomplished with these drugs because the amount of opioid that can be delivered is limited by the amount of acetaminophen in each dose. When the maximum dose of acetaminophen is reached, an alternative strategy for pain control is needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> is also widely used as an over-the-counter pain and fever medication, and is often combined with other ingredients, such as cough and cold ingredients.&nbsp;Consumers are often unaware that many such products contain acetaminophen, making it easy to accidentally take too much acetaminophen. In order to diminish the risk of severe liver damage (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acetaminophen'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Health care providers should only prescribe combination products that contain 325 mg or less of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> per dosage unit. The maximum dose should be limited to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> with maximal single doses not to exceed 1000 mg. The maximum dose should be lower, no more than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> if the patient has known liver disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients taking combination drug products that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> must be educated to avoid heavy alcohol consumption while taking acetaminophen and to avoid unintentional overdose through the use of over-the-counter drug combinations that contain acetaminophen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of an NSAID is reasonable for a patient with mild to moderate cancer-related pain and no contraindication to the use of NSAIDs.
