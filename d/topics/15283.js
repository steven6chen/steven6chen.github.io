The tract is kept patent by deployment of an expandable metal stent across it, thereby allowing blood to return to the systemic circulation. The ability of TIPS to function like a surgical side-to-side portacaval shunt without requiring general anesthesia and major surgery led to its rapid acceptance into clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the expanding use of TIPS has also led to its misuse in some instances.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the role of TIPS in the management of acute esophageal, gastric, or ectopic variceal hemorrhage, and in the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding. Other indications for the use of TIPS (eg, ascites and hydrothorax), contraindications, and complications associated with this procedure are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts: Complications&quot;</a>). A guideline (updated in 2009) issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) is also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

These can be broadly grouped into treatments that address the local bleeding site and those that reduce portal pressure directly. Examples of the former are esophageal sclerotherapy, band ligation, and balloon tamponade. Treatments to reduce portal pressure include pharmacologic agents (such as somatostatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>, and their analogues), surgically created shunts, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS). In clinical practice, these modalities are sometimes used together. Patients who have recurrent bleeding or bleeding refractory to a specific therapy may benefit from one of these alternatives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>None of the treatments available for variceal hemorrhage is optimal. This is due both to the failure of any treatment to uniformly achieve hemostasis and to the inability to arrest progression of cirrhosis or prevent liver failure. In addition, each modality has its unique spectrum of complications, which also contribute to morbidity and mortality. The choice of a specific therapeutic modality depends upon its relative efficacy and safety in a given clinical setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Active hemorrhage from esophageal varices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment of active variceal hemorrhage is to quickly arrest initial bleeding and bleeding-related complications, prevent recurrent bleeding, and minimize treatment-associated morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic and pharmacologic treatment is first-line therapy for active esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Endoscopic sclerotherapy or band ligation can be performed at the bedside by practically all trained gastroenterologists and achieves hemostasis in 80 to 90 percent of subjects. Both methods decrease early rebleeding and improve short-term survival. Pharmacologic therapy is also effective, widely available, and can be used in combination with endoscopic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Studies have also shown that early TIPS can lead to good outcomes in select patients when performed by experienced radiologists in institutions where TIPS is readily available. Specifically, the use of early TIPS has been shown to be effective for high-risk patients, such as those with a hepatic venous pressure gradient of 20 mmHg or more or those with persistent bleeding at endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This has been further corroborated by an evaluation of TIPS for acute variceal bleeding in clinical practice, which had results similar to those seen in the randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

In addition, it is associated with a variety of potential complications, some of which may be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Other patients may rebleed in the first few days after cessation of the index bleed. A second attempt to control hemorrhage with endoscopic treatment is sometimes effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, when two attempts to control active hemorrhage fail, the risk of mortality rises exponentially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The precise definition of &quot;failure of endoscopic treatment&quot; remains controversial; we consider failure to be the recurrence of variceal hemorrhage despite at least two sessions of endoscopic treatment performed no more than two weeks apart.</p><p>Emergency shunt surgery is extremely effective in arresting hemorrhage and preventing rebleeding, but it is associated with approximately a 50 percent mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Many patients die of liver failure and complications of surgery, despite achievement of hemostasis. Those with severe hemorrhage, tense ascites, deep coma, aspiration pneumonia, renal failure, or sepsis are at particular risk from surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Multiple series have demonstrated the efficacy of TIPS for uncontrolled esophageal variceal hemorrhage despite emergent endoscopic and pharmacologic treatment in patients who are poor-risk candidates for urgent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. An illustrative report focused on patients who were referred for TIPS within 72 hours of emergent endoscopic treatment and were considered to be poor-risk candidates for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients were stabilized initially with balloon tamponade and TIPS was placed semi-emergently within 12 hours. Balloon tamponade was discontinued within 12 to 24 hours after TIPS placement. TIPS was placed successfully in 29 of 30 patients and achieved hemostasis in all patients. The six-week survival was 60 percent in this cohort of moribund subjects whose expected survival rate, based upon historic controls, was approximately 10 percent. In those without pulmonary aspiration, the survival was 90 percent at six weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64881\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64881 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Only two episodes of early rebleeding were noted after TIPS and were due to technical problems related to stent shortening and collapse of the parenchymal tract; these were easily treated by dilation of the tract and placement of additional stents across the dilated tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Salvage therapy for patients who are good surgical candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have compared TIPS to surgery in the management of refractory hemorrhage in patients who are good surgical candidates. However, a vast body of literature exists on the use of surgery for the control of variceal hemorrhage, and underscores the fact that surgery is still a reasonable treatment option in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A 2009 guideline issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases concluded that TIPS or a distal splenorenal shunt were similarly effective in prevention of rebleeding in patients who failed medical therapy based upon the results of a controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. Thus, it may be reasonable to consider the available expertise and the patient's individual circumstances. As an example, patients who live in remote areas and have poor access to medical services may be better served by surgical therapy. On the other hand, TIPS may be a useful temporizing measure in those awaiting liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding gastric varices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding from gastric varices is difficult to control endoscopically, although an increasing number of endoscopic approaches have been described. Endoscopy is critical for distinguishing between an esophageal and gastric source of variceal bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most settings, the initial treatment of bleeding fundic gastric varices is pharmacologic. Unfortunately, this often fails to control bleeding, necessitating the use of other modalities. The traditional treatment of patients with bleeding gastric varices that fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy has been surgical portal decompression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical trials have also shown that TIPS can also be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>]. In one study, for example, 28 patients with bleeding gastric fundal varices unresponsive to pharmacologic treatment underwent emergency TIPS. Bleeding was controlled in 96 percent, which was comparable to the success for bleeding esophageal varices (98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In another series of 32 patients, hemostasis was achieved in 18 of 20 patients (90 percent) who were actively bleeding; rebleeding rates for the group as a whole were 14, 26, and 32 percent at one month, six months, and one year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Complications were observed in seven patients (22 percent), four of which were fatal.</p><p>TIPS may be less effective than surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], particularly in patients with bleeding gastric varices who have spontaneous splenorenal collaterals. Flow through collaterals that feed the gastric varices often persists after TIPS, and the varices do not disappear even after an adequate shunt is created [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Over time, these patients remain at risk for recurrent variceal hemorrhage.</p><p>The choice of the procedure between portal decompression and surgical ligation of the splenorenal collaterals depends upon the anatomy, underlying degree of liver failure, clinical status, and local expertise. TIPS does provide effective, although often short-term, portal decompression in this setting. Glue injection is an acceptable alternative to these strategies, although it is not currently approved for this indication in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Management of gastric varices'</a>). The precise decrease in the HVPG needed to minimize the risk of rebleeding is not known, although it might be lower than for esophageal varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If spontaneous splenorenal collaterals are present, patients should be monitored closely since the effectiveness of TIPS is less predictable due to competing shunts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding ectopic varices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Varices occasionally develop at sites other than the stomach and esophagus and come to clinical attention when they bleed. Examples are duodenal, rectal, and peristomal varices (which develop around the stoma in patients who have a colostomy). Endoscopic treatment is often unsuccessful in these cases, and traditional treatment has been surgical.</p><p>Anecdotal reports have noted that the bleeding can also be controlled by TIPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. It is unlikely that enough cases will be seen by any center to generate &quot;hard data&quot; upon which to base therapy. One disadvantage with TIPS is that it requires close follow-up for several years. A guideline issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends TIPS as the preferred approach for prevention of rebleeding in patients with ectopic varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF RECURRENT VARICEAL HEMORRHAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following successful treatment of variceal bleeding, several options are available for preventing recurrent bleeding. Long-term pharmacologic therapy usually with nonselective beta blockers, repeat endoscopy sessions with band ligation or sclerotherapy with the aim of obliterating esophageal varices, or a combination of the two are common strategies. However, neither of these methods alone or in combination is successful in all patients. Furthermore, endoscopic obliteration of varices requires multiple sessions with the associated risks, and recurrent hemorrhage may occur while varices are being obliterated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) decompresses the portal vein, and treats the cause of variceal hemorrhage, while avoiding general anesthesia and major surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72311 \">figure 1</a>). In patients with ascites, TIPS has the added benefit of decompressing the hepatic sinusoids, thereby treating the cause of ascites. Variceal hemorrhage is unlikely to recur as long as the TIPS remains patent.</p><p>When compared with other approaches, TIPS has many features of an optimal long-term treatment for the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage. Several clinical trials have now been performed to see if these considerations hold true in practice. Interpretation of these data suggests that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIPS is more effective than endoscopic treatment for the prevention of recurrent bleeding.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with endoscopic methods, TIPS does not improve mortality and may be associated with increased mortality in those with advanced liver failure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIPS is associated with its unique profile of complications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">TIPS versus endoscopic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of TIPS versus endoscopic therapy for the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>]. Most used endoscopic sclerotherapy, but there have also been studies comparing TIPS to endoscopic band ligation or glue injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/22,30,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30,33-36</a>]. Comparison among these trials can be difficult for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different sclerotherapy protocols were used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of liver failure varied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While most studies randomized patients within 24 hours of admission, one trial, which found no benefit of TIPS, focused primarily on long-term rebleeding and randomized patients after a mean of 10 days compared to one to two days in the other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The timing issue may be important since it has been suggested that TIPS is significantly better than sclerotherapy in preventing rebleeding only when it is performed less than one week after the initial bleed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>All but one study demonstrated a significant decrease in the risk of rebleeding in patients undergoing TIPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52679 \">figure 3</a>). The differences across studies were due to the variable rebleeding rates after endoscopic treatment rather than after TIPS (which was approximately 20 percent). Despite the beneficial effects on bleeding, TIPS was associated with either no survival advantage or poorer survival. In addition, hepatic encephalopathy occurred at least twice as frequently following TIPS in most of the studies. Advanced age, liver failure, shunt fraction (shunt diameter), and a history of encephalopathy prior to TIPS are all risk factors for worsening encephalopathy after TIPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

The patients in the trial either had ongoing bleeding despite endoscopic therapy or were at high risk of rebleeding. TIPS was preformed within 72 hours of the initial endoscopy in 45 patients with variceal bleeding (62 percent were done within 24 hours), whereas 30 were treated medically. At one year, patients treated with TIPS were less likely to have failure to control bleeding or rebleeding than those treated medically (7 versus 47 percent). In addition, patients who underwent TIPS had higher one-year actuarial probability of survival (86 versus 70 percent).</p><p/><p>More studies are needed to validate these observations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence of portal hypertension and stent stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal cause of rebleeding after TIPS is the recurrence of portal hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53289 \">table 1</a>).

Because stent stenosis is less common with covered stents, these stents are now considered to be the standard of care. Doppler sonography is specific but somewhat insensitive depending upon the specific cutoffs used for the diagnosis of stent stenosis. Angiography is the gold standard for the detection of stent stenosis and is required for its treatment. A commonly used regimen is angiography at 6 and 12 months after TIPS and annually thereafter for the first three years. The propensity for development of stent stenosis decreases after four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Newer coated stents reduce the incidence of stent stenosis with high patency rates seen in several randomized and retrospective trials.

There is emerging evidence suggesting a role for early TIPS in the treatment of selected patients with active variceal hemorrhage. Shunt surgery can also be considered in this setting in centers with expertise in these procedures. TIPS is preferred to shunt surgery in patients with poor liver function. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute variceal hemorrhage'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest TIPS in patients with bleeding gastric varices despite pharmacologic treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Endoscopic therapy with glue injection is an acceptable alternative in settings where it is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-achieve-hemostasis-in-patients-with-acute-variceal-hemorrhage#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to achieve hemostasis in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Management of gastric varices'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest TIPS in patients with bleeding ectopic varices (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Endoscopic and surgical approaches may be acceptable alternatives where expertise is available. Endoscopic approaches tend to be unsuccessful for long-term prevention. Surgical approaches should be considered based upon the availability of local expertise and should generally be performed in patients with relatively preserved liver function.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Grace ND.
