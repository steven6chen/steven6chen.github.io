Socioeconomic trends, such as longer work hours, more women employed outside the home, and a high number of single-parent households have changed the way families obtain their meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. As parents experience busier lifestyles, they demand convenience for their family meals. The consumption of fast food is fostered because of the quick service, convenience, good taste, and inexpensive prices relative to more traditional home-style restaurants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the epidemiology and nutritional consequences of fast food consumption in children and adolescents, as well as influences that affect fast food intake and management strategies.

About 33 percent of children and adolescents in the United States consume fast food on a typical day, providing on average about 12 percent of daily calories, and intake increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In non-metropolitan areas, adolescents and parents who live in towns with five or more fast food outlets were 30 percent more likely to eat fast food compared with those in towns with no fast food outlets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The influence of in-town fast food outlets on fast food intake was strongest among families with low motor vehicle access. In contrast, fast food dining is less common when families have closer proximity and easier access to supermarkets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In the United States, more than 48 percent of today's food dollar is spent away from home, a value that has almost doubled over the past 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Driven by consumers' growing interest in convenience, sales at quick-service restaurants are expected to generate $201 billion in 2016, with a projected annual growth of 2.5 percent for several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Snack, convenience, fast foods, and sweets continue to dominate food advertisements viewed by children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The marketing of these items contributes to the fast food consumption of children in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. On a typical day, preschool-aged children (2 to 5 years) view 10 television fast food advertisements, elementary-school children (6 to 11 years) view 12 television advertisements, and adolescents (12 to 18 years) view up to 15 television advertisements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Hispanic preschoolers, children, and adolescents viewed, on average, 11.6 to 12.4 television food ads per day, an observation of particular concern given the higher rates of obesity among Hispanic youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. One study indicates that 98 percent of television food-product advertisements viewed by adolescents promote foods that are high in fat, sugar, or sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In the United States, $8 billion is spent on food and beverages by children between the ages of 4 and 12 years, and these children also exert a strong influence on their parents' choices of quick-service establishments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Increases in fast food consumption have been reported in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Longitudinal studies conducted among Chinese school-aged children show substantial increases in consumption of western-style fast food, particularly among adolescents, based on data obtained from the 2004 and 2009 Chinese Health and Nutrition Survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The increase in fast food consumption was observed among all age, gender, and family income groups. Fast food consumption is high in childhood and increases in adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Frequent consumption of fast food has adverse effects on nutrition because of excessive content of energy and fat and low nutritional value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,36-40</a>]. Moreover, consumption of fast food is associated with other poor nutritional habits: surveys show that parents who reported purchasing fast food for family meals at least three times per week were significantly more likely than parents who reported purchasing fewer than three fast food family meals to report the availability of soft drinks and chips in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Of note, the &quot;empty calorie&quot; content (low nutritional value) of children's dietary intake from retail food stores and schools is similar to that of fast food restaurants. The source of added sugar and fat from retail food stores and schools, including sugar-sweetened beverages, grain desserts, pizza, and high-fat milk was similar to that from fast food restaurants including high-fat milk beverages, dairy desserts, french fries, and pizza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. More importantly, children from middle and low social class backgrounds were more likely to report low intake of fruits and vegetables, given low exposure to supermarket food sources and high exposure to fast food outlets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H992915828\"><span class=\"h2\">Educational strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fast foods are a way of life for many American families, and eliminating fast foods may not be realistic. The challenge is to teach children and adolescents to make wise food choices when visiting fast food establishments. This is an important issue since the establishment of healthy eating patterns in childhood is linked to a reduction in chronic diseases, such as obesity, coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and diet-related cancers later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/44-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-50</a>]. Healthful eating patterns for children over the age of two can be achieved by consumption of a prudent diet that is moderate in total fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol, and high in complex carbohydrates, fiber, calcium, and antioxidant nutrients such as vitamins C and E and the carotenoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>Another useful strategy for improving young children's eating behaviors is to use marketing techniques for &quot;branding&quot; higher quality foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Children prefer the taste of foods and drinks if they think the selections are from well-known commercial establishments such as McDonald's; using marketing techniques to similarly &quot;brand&quot; higher quality foods may counterbalance some of the effects of fast food marketing. Educational strategies are sometimes effective in promoting healthy eating behaviors. As an example, the popularized film &quot;Super Size Me&quot; has the potential to educate and change behaviors including reducing fast food intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Another strategy is to limit children's exposure to television networks that air child-directed advertisements for children's fast food meals with the collection of fast food meal toy premiums [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>Young children are vulnerable to child-targeted advertising of fast food on television, as shown in a study that found an association between such advertising and fast food consumption in pre-school aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. These findings support recommendations to limit child-directed fast food marketing, and to promote active parental mediation to limit fast food consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF FAST FOODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Junk food&quot; is a descriptive term commonly associated with fast food. Although &quot;junk food&quot; has negative connotation, not all foods found in fast food restaurants contribute to adverse dietary lifestyles and eating habits. The extent to which fast foods influence the nutritional status of the child or adolescent depends upon several factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nutritive quality of the menu items</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of menu items that comprise a meal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amounts consumed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency with which the meals are eaten</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Concerns</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutrient content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many fast foods can be high in energy, total and saturated fat, added sugar, cholesterol, and sodium; and low in vitamins A and C, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a>, fiber, and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,37,62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,37,62-65</a>]. This nutrient profile is evident in traditional fast food meals such as a hamburger, french fries, fruit turnover, and soft drink; or fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, biscuit, and soft drink (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116600 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Fat accounts for 45 to 55 percent of calories in some fast foods (as compared with recommended fat content of 30 percent or less of total calories). In a survey of fast food purchased at lunchtime from chain retailers in New York, only one in 36 meals purchased met the U.S. Food and Drug administration's guidelines for &quot;healthy&quot; sodium levels (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/meal),</span> and one in five meals exceeded the recommended daily limit for sodium (2300 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The average meal purchased contained 880 calories and 1750 mg sodium. In an analysis of 12 national fast food restaurants with over 5400 possible &quot;kids' meal&quot; combinations, less than 1 percent (33) met the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended nutrition standards in regard to fat, sugar, sodium, and whole grains for elementary school meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,68</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Portion size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In response to health authorities' call to reduce portion sizes, fast food outlets have changed the names for portion sizes for menu items and meals. For example, major fast food outlets have phased out &quot;super-sized,&quot; &quot;biggie-sized,&quot; and &quot;jumbo-sized&quot; items; food items and meals are now available in &quot;small,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; and &quot;large.&quot; However, at point of ordering, customers are encouraged to upgrade smaller menu items to larger sizes for a few cents more. Because of these marketing techniques, children and adolescents learn to equate &quot;volume&quot; with &quot;value&quot;. In addition, most fast food outlets have &quot;specialty burgers&quot; available with one to four beef patties and additional bacon and cheese &quot;extras.&quot; Energy, fat, and sodium consumption increases substantially with the number of &quot;extras.&quot; The choice of &quot;large-size&quot; or &quot;specialty burgers&quot; can significantly increase the energy, fat, and sodium content of the meal. As an example, a large hamburger supplies 540 kcal and 28 g of fat compared with 250 kcal and 8 g of fat in a regular hamburger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116600 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Similarly, a large-size order of french fries, large soft drink, and dessert can add up to an additional 1030 kcal. Such a meal can provide 1570 kcal and 62 g of fat, which is about 80 percent of total daily energy needs and 100 percent of daily fat needs for a 13-year-old child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Thus, the high energy density of a fast food meal tends to encourage over-consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,65</a>]. Legislation to require labeling on menus describing calorie content at the point of purchase is in place in several states, and national legislation is in progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Customers who purchase fast food exhibit somewhat more restraint when the energy content is revealed. In a survey study of several fast food chains, customers purchased a mean of 827 calories per meal, and 34 percent purchased more than 1000 calories per meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. When calorie information was posted at the point of purchase at one fast food outlet, patrons who noticed the information purchased an average of 52 fewer calories than those who did not notice the information. Similarly, in another study, 106 adolescents were asked to order dinner from fast food menus and then order from fast food menus with calorie and fat information posted next to the menu items. Although the majority (70 percent) of the adolescents did not modify their food-ordering behavior, 30 percent reduced calorie- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fat-ordering behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Parents of young children also tend to respond to nutritional information if it is provided on the menu. In a randomized trial, the energy content of the food ordered by parents for their three to six year-old children was reduced by an average of 100 kcals when nutrition information was provided on the menu [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. A parent's selection of food for their child also correlates with the parent's interest in and perceived empowerment about nutrition decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>The social context of most fast food meals also encourages over-consumption: many fast food meals are consumed while riding in the car or watching television. In this type of setting children tend to overeat because their attention is distracted and they are less aware of satiety signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4147846\"><span class=\"h3\">Data on nutritional effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings from a national household survey among children highlight the nutritional effects of fast food consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Compared to children who did not eat fast food on a given day, children who did consumed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More total energy (2236 versus 2049 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More total fat (84 versus 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More total carbohydrates (303 versus 277 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More added sugars (122 versus 94 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages (471 versus 243 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less milk (236 versus 302 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less fiber (13.2 versus 14.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer fruits and non-starchy vegetables (103 versus 148 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span></p><p/><p>Similar findings were noted in a longitudinal multicenter cohort study of female adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In this study, increased frequency of fast food consumption was associated with increased intake of energy and sodium and increased intake of total fat and saturated fat as a percentage of calories.</p><p>In a national study of adolescents, intake of milk, fruits and vegetables were generally low, and achievement of recommended intake was less likely in youth who consumed fast food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. No relationships were seen between fast food consumption and achievement of recommendations for grains, <span class=\"nowrap\">meats/beans,</span> and oils. In this study, no association was seen between adolescents' weight status and level of fast food intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4147871\"><span class=\"h3\">Association with obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fast food consumption may be particularly problematic for overweight adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In one study of fast food consumption among lean (body mass index [BMI] &le;85th percentile for age and sex) and overweight (BMI &gt;85th percentile but &lt;98th percentile) adolescents, both groups were instructed to eat as much or as little as desired during a one-hour &quot;extra-large&quot; fast food meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In this setting, both groups ingested a large amount of energy (mean energy intake 1652 kcal or 62 percent of estimated daily requirement). However, overweight adolescents consumed more energy (1860 versus 1458 kcal, or 66.5 versus 57 percent of estimated daily requirement). In addition, whereas lean adolescents had similar total energy intakes on days during which they did and did not consume fast food (2575 versus 2622 kcal), overweight adolescents had increased total energy intake on fast food days (2703 versus 2295). In another study, ready access to fast food outlets was independently associated with an increased odds of diagnosed childhood obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. More frequent fast food consumption was associated with higher BMI measures in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, another study suggests that consumption of a Western diet is more strongly associated with obesity and poor dietary outcomes than consumption of fast food itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Other studies have suggested that the intake of fast food among children presenting for obesity treatment may not be associated with the degree of obesity at baseline or the degree of weight loss during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Opportunities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fortunately, choices at fast food restaurants are no longer limited to hamburgers, french fries, and soft drinks.

The following represent general recommendations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fill in &quot;nutrient gaps&quot; from a typical fast food meal by healthy snacks at home. Offer fresh fruits, vegetables, cheese and crackers, low-fat milk, calcium-fortified juices, and frozen yogurt as snacks. Making healthful food taste and look better and be more convenient also is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage portion control; educate adolescents that anything that equates with bigness such as &quot;large,&quot; &quot;extra,&quot; &quot;double,&quot; or &quot;triple&quot; will be high in calories and fat. Recommend smaller portions, since a regular serving is enough for most children, or sharing with a parent or sibling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look for whole grain foods, fruits, vegetables, and calcium-rich foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enjoy eating out, be adventurous, and visit a variety of types of ethnic fast food restaurants. Try Mexican, Asian, Italian, and seafood restaurants as well as those serving American fare. As with eating at home, variety is the key to a well-balanced diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When planning a fast food meal, try to choose an establishment that promotes healthier options at the point of purchase.

Mayonnaise can add about 80 calories (9 g of fat). Deli sandwiches made of lean turkey or roast beef (mustard only) provide less than 30 percent of their energy from fat. Low-fat extras such as lettuce, tomato, onions, mustard, and low-fat salad dressings make healthy sandwich toppings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative main dishes &ndash; Try chili or soft tacos. Soft tacos have less fat than hard tacos because the tortilla has not been fried. Use salsa to add extra flavor; limit the use of high-fat sour cream and guacamole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side dishes &ndash; Choose a baked potato rather than french fries, limiting the use of butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and shredded cheese. Vegetables or chili should be used as toppings. If available, separate side dishes of steamed vegetables supply vitamins A and C.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pizza &ndash; Order thin-crust pizzas made with low-fat cheese and vegetables or lower-fat meat, such as ham. Higher-fat sausage or pepperoni should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salad &ndash; Avoid large amounts of high-fat items, such as regular fat-containing dressing, bacon bits, and shredded cheese. Assorted fresh fruits and vegetables, or beans add extra fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beverages &ndash; Choose low-fat milk, yogurt shakes, or juice as substitutes for soft drinks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desserts &ndash; Select low-fat frozen yogurt cones or sundaes and fresh fruit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fast-food-for-children-and-adolescents/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].
