In addition, progression from elevated blood pressure to hypertension is accelerated in blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The reasons for these observations are incompletely understood as the relative importance of environmental and genetic factors has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The treatment of hypertension is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in blacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Important risk factors for hypertension among blacks include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower socioeconomic status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of a <span class=\"nowrap\">high-sodium/low-potassium</span> diet</p><p/><p>Another possible mechanism, which is also related to lower socioeconomic class, is poor maternal nutrition leading to low birth weight in the infant. Low birth weight has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension in adulthood, perhaps due in part to impaired renal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An associated reduction in renal development with fewer functioning nephrons may contribute to the predisposition to the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], including ESRD occurring before the age of 50 years, in African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=possible-role-of-low-birth-weight-in-the-pathogenesis-of-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Possible role of low birth weight in the pathogenesis of primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There may also be a gradient of risk according to geography, with standardized prevalences of hypertension of 14 percent in West Africa, 26 percent in the Caribbean, and 55 percent in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, these differences in risk can be explained almost entirely by differences in body mass index since there is a consistent relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and body mass index across black populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF HYPERTENSIVE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Black patients with primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) are at much greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications. This is manifested, in comparison with whites, by a threefold increase in overall cardiovascular mortality and a six- to sevenfold increase in mortality under the age of 50 years. Blacks are at significantly greater risk for stroke than whites, especially at younger ages, due in part to the earlier onset and greater severity of hypertension. In one study, for example, every 10 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure increased stroke risk by 24 percent in blacks compared with 8 percent in whites; this disparity in risk extended to individuals whose systolic blood pressure was as low as 120 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Treatment of hypertension reduces but does not eliminate the racial difference in stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Blacks also experience earlier development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis than whites, as well as a 5- to 18-fold higher incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which is most prominent in the 25- to 45-year age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Blacks are also at increased risk for some other renal diseases, particularly diabetic nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The race-related difference in risk can be largely eliminated by adequate antihypertensive therapy, suggesting an important role for more severe and less well-controlled hypertension in blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Another possible contributing factor is a <strong>less prominent decline</strong> in nocturnal blood pressure in blacks, thereby increasing the total blood pressure load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One study evaluated 62 black and 72 white treated hypertensives who were matched for the same daytime blood pressure by ambulatory monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The mean blood pressure between 1 AM and 5 AM was 7 mmHg higher in the black patients. Why this occurs is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental and socioeconomic factors are also likely to be important. As an example, blacks more frequently ingest a <span class=\"nowrap\">high-sodium/low-potassium</span> diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], a combination that can both raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. The incidence of salt sensitivity appears to be higher in blacks than in whites due perhaps to upward resetting of the set point for tubuloglomerular feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salt intake, salt restriction, and primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-and-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Potassium and hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Indirect evidence in support of the importance of lower socioeconomic status is the observation that Mexican Americans also have an increased (though to a lesser degree) incidence of hypertensive nephrosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], despite having a slightly lower prevalence of hypertension than non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may, in addition, be a specific susceptibility to left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertensive nephrosclerosis in blacks. At the same level of blood pressure and total vascular resistance, both left ventricular mass and renal vascular resistance are higher in hypertensive blacks than in hypertensive whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Furthermore, there appears to be as much as a four- to fivefold increase in the incidence of hypertensive renal failure in blacks that persists after the severity of hypertension, degree of hypertensive control, and socioeconomic status are taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Even seemingly adequate control of the hypertension may not be completely protective, as the renal disease may continue to progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23</a>].</p><p>There is also indirect evidence supporting the hypothesis that blacks are particularly susceptible to hypertension-induced renal injury. The overall increase in treating hypertension has led to a reduction in the incidence of stroke and heart failure in both whites and blacks. Despite this clear cardiovascular benefit, there has been a continuing rise in the incidence of ESRD in older black patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], which is presumably due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/11,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23</a>].</p><p>It remains uncertain why blacks might be particularly susceptible to renal disease. Genetic factors likely play a role in the increased susceptibility of blacks to hypertensive nephrosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Polymorphisms in the genes that encode apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>] are found far more commonly in African Americans compared with European Americans. These genetic variations appear to confer a markedly increased risk for nondiabetic ESRD, including that due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The APOL1 variant may have had a survival advantage in Africa due to enhanced defense against sleeping sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-associated-nephropathy-hivan\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another possibility may relate to the autoregulation of renal blood flow. One study evaluated white and black patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension on a low-salt diet and then on free salt intake (mean change in sodium excretion was from 40 up to 155 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The high-salt diet was associated with a rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in blacks, while there was no change in whites. This glomerular hyperfiltration is probably associated with intraglomerular hypertension, a potential risk factor for progressive renal disease. As noted above, this may be particularly likely when maternal malnutrition leads to low birth weight and a reduction in nephron number. Another intrinsic difference in renal function is the increased renal oxygen consumption and oxidative stress observed in blacks compared with whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GOAL BLOOD PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In summary, effective antihypertensive therapy is particularly important in black patients. A discussion of which antihypertensive drugs should be used can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in blacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal blood pressure in black patients is similar to that in non-black patients and depends in part upon comorbid conditions and overall cardiovascular risk. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The two largest studies to examine goal blood pressure in blacks were the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK). SPRINT enrolled individuals at high cardiovascular risk, whereas AASK enrolled patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SPRINT, discussed in detail elsewhere, assigned 9361 patients, including 2802 non-Hispanic blacks, to a systolic blood pressure goal of &lt;120 mmHg or a goal of &lt;140 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The benefit from more intensive blood pressure lowering was similar in black and non-black subgroups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AASK included 1094 African Americans with long-standing hypertension, otherwise unexplained slowly progressive chronic renal failure, and mild proteinuria (mean of approximately 500 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> but a median of approximately 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]; this pattern in blacks is almost always associated with histologic changes compatible with nephrosclerosis as the sole disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The patients were allocated to one of three drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> (463 patients), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> (441 patients), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> (217 patients), and to one of two blood pressure goals, <span class=\"nowrap\">125/75</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg. The effect of the goal blood pressure in AASK is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H163440722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'AASK trial of goal blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations by others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In November 2010, a consensus statement concerning the management of high blood pressure in African Americans was published by the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. For those with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension), a goal blood pressure less than <span class=\"nowrap\">135/85</span> mmHg was considered a reasonable target. A lower goal of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg was recommended in patients at increased risk, such as those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or proteinuric chronic kidney disease. However, the 2017 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> hypertension guidelines did not make separate recommendations for black patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertensive-complications-in-blacks/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Our recommendations on goal blood pressure, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> recommendations, are presented separately.
