The tunica vaginalis is a structure containing a potential space that encompasses the anterior two-thirds of the testicle in which fluid from a variety of sources may accumulate. The epididymis usually is positioned posterolaterally to the testicle and must be differentiated from an abnormal mass. The spermatic cord, which consists of the testicular vessels and the vas deferens, is connected to the base of the epididymis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3023105666\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of scrotal pain or swelling begins with a careful history and physical examination. Based upon these findings further ancillary studies, such as Doppler ultrasonography, and urine testing establish the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A focused history in a boy with scrotal pain or swelling can help to narrow the differential diagnosis and lead to a more productive examination. The essential points include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there history of pain? If so, determine the onset and severity (remember that some adolescents may not report scrotal pain because of modesty or embarrassment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The major causes of acute scrotal pain in children and adolescents are testicular torsion, torsion of testicular or epididymal appendages, and epididymitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency. These and other causes of testicular and scrotal pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of trauma? Blunt scrotal trauma is common in children and adolescents. Although severe injury is rare, it can cause unilateral testicular pain arising from testicular contusion, rupture, or traumatic testicular torsion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents#H16472916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scrotal trauma in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of change in testicular or scrotal size? If so, what is the onset of this change? Does scrotal size vary with time of day, position, or Valsalva maneuver? Such changes are suggestive of communicating hydrocele (with or without an inguinal hernia) or varicocele. These conditions and other causes of scrotal swelling are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of painless scrotal swelling in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient sexually active? Sexual activity may be associated with epididymitis, although epididymitis also occurs in prepubertal and nonsexually active males. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Epididymitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient having difficulty voiding or painful urination? Difficulty voiding suggests a urinary tract infection; intraabdominal, pelvic or rectal mass; or neurologic problem, including a lesion of the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there flank pain or hematuria? These findings suggest a renal stone, which may cause referred pain in the scrotum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there abdominal pain associated with decreased appetite, nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting? These symptoms can be nonspecific but may represent referred pain associated with testicular torsion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient had fever? Fever suggests orchitis due to infections such as coxsackie virus, mumps, or brucellosis. Fever is also seen in some patients with epididymitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Orchitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Epididymitis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parents should receive a brief overview of the genital examination before the examination is begun. A parent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chaperone should be present for the examination if the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> examiner prefers. Uninterrupted privacy must be guaranteed during the examination. The patient's undergarments should be removed, and a gown or towel (held by the patient) should be offered to alleviate any embarrassment.</p><p>For most aspects of the examination the patient should be standing. The examiner can sit or stand. The evaluation of patients with scrotal pain or swelling should include a detailed examination of the abdomen, inguinal region, and genitalia, including the testes, epididymis, spermatic cord, scrotal skin, penis, and cremasteric reflex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Genital examination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to inspect the penis, pubic hair, and inguinal area while the patient is standing. The examiner should notice the presence or absence of any ulcers, papules, urethral discharge, piercings, tattoos, pubic hair infestation, or lymphadenopathy. Ulcers, papules, discharge, and lymphadenopathy may suggest a sexually transmitted infection. Piercings and tattoos may provide a portal of entry for skin and soft tissue infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'STI clinical patterns'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-piercing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body piercing in adolescents and young adults&quot;, section on 'Localized infection'</a>.)</p><p>The position of the testicles (eg, high versus low and horizontal versus vertical) should be evaluated. The left testicle usually lies slightly lower than the right testicle.</p><p>Patients with varicoceles should also be examined in the supine position. This maneuver will help to differentiate idiopathic from secondary varicocele. Idiopathic varicocele usually is more prominent in the upright position and disappears when the patient is supine, whereas secondary varicocele usually does not get much smaller with change in position from upright to supine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of painless scrotal swelling in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Varicocele'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examiner should palpate the entire testicular surface by gently rolling it between his or her thumb and forefingers. The testicle should have the consistency of a hard-boiled egg. The epididymis should be palpated in the posterolateral position and followed to the spermatic cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The examiner should note any swelling or tenderness along any of these structures; if swelling is noted, transillumination may help to determine if it is cystic or solid in nature. Transillumination is performed by placing a light source at the base of the scrotum. Fluid-filled masses (eg, hydrocele or spermatocele) will transfer the light and cause the scrotum to glow; solid masses (eg, torsed testicle) will not. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Cremasteric reflex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cremasteric reflex should be assessed by stroking the upper thigh while observing the ipsilateral testis. A normal response is cremasteric contraction with elevation of the testis. The reflex is present in the majority of healthy boys between the ages of 30 months and 12 years; it is less consistently present in infants and teenagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The reflex is almost always absent in patients with testicular torsion, which may help to distinguish this condition from other causes of scrotal pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54439 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Prehn sign (testicular elevation)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prehn reported that elevation of the scrotal contents relieves the pain in patients with epididymitis and aggravates or has no effect on the pain in patients with the emergency condition, testicular torsion. However, Prehn sign may not be a reliable distinguishing feature between testicular torsion, epididymitis, and other diagnoses in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the genital examination, abdominal and rectal examinations are indicated if clinical suspicion exists for an abdominal or rectal mass, metastatic visceral disease, or prostatitis. </p><p>The initial laboratory and radiologic studies that help to differentiate among causes of scrotal pain or swelling vary according to the presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Testicular pain</strong> &ndash; Testicular torsion is one of the prime concerns in pediatric patients with testicular pain. Emergency evaluation and color Doppler ultrasonography is indicated to delineate anatomy, to assess perfusion, and to identify or exclude testicular torsion. Scintigraphy (radionuclide scan) was a study that was done in the past but has now been supplanted by ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Testicular torsion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Scrotal exploration is necessary for diagnosis in cases when the clinical examination and imaging cannot exclude testicular torsion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Urinalysis and urine culture (pyuria is common in epididymitis but unusual in testicular torsion or torsion of the appendix testis or appendix epididymis) and should also be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evaluation for sexually transmitted infections in adolescent patients who have findings consistent with sexually transmitted epididymitis is also appropriate. As in the adult male, options include rapid molecular testing, nucleic acid amplification testing of urethral discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nucleic acid amplification testing of urine, Gram stain of urethral discharge (if present), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults#H3603594390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute scrotal pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Painless scrotal swelling</strong> &ndash; Most patients with painless scrotal swelling can have the underlying cause determined by history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57879 \">table 2</a>). Doppler ultrasonography is indicated to further investigate a solid mass. Ultrasonography may occasionally be helpful to confirm the finding of a spermatocele. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-painless-scrotal-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of painless scrotal swelling in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major considerations in the differential diagnosis of scrotal pain or swelling can be divided according to the predominant symptom: pain or swelling. An experienced clinician often can render an accurate diagnosis based upon the history and physical examination alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54439 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57879 \">table 2</a>). However, advances in color Doppler imaging of the scrotum have made this modality a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in many cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain predominant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of acute scrotal pain in children and adolescents are testicular torsion (a surgical emergency), torsion of the appendix testis, and epididymitis. Other causes include incarcerated inguinal hernia (a surgical emergency), torsion of the appendix epididymis, trauma, immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]), orchitis, infection (eg, Fournier's gangrene), and referred pain (eg, from a renal stone). Distinguishing clinical features of these conditions are summarized below. Diagnosis and management are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular torsion generally presents with the abrupt onset of severe pain. The testicle may lie transversely in the scrotum and be retracted <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swollen; the cremasteric reflex typically is absent. Testicular perfusion is decreased and can be assessed on Doppler ultrasound or nuclear scan of the scrotum. Although the clinical and radiographic evaluations may be normal at the time of presentation in a boy with an intermittent torsion that has been reduced, findings may be present to varying degrees on physical examination and imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Testicular torsion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-testicular-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal testicular torsion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Torsion of the appendix testis also presents with the abrupt onset of pain. The pain is initially localized to the region of the appendix testis (anterosuperior, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67439\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67439 \">figure 2</a>)) and is frequently mild. With progression and the development of a reactive hydrocele, diffuse swelling and tenderness that are similar to testicular torsion may occur. A pathognomic &quot;blue dot&quot; sign may be apparent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65781 \">picture 1</a>). Testicular perfusion is normal on imaging studies.

Patients with epididymo-orchitis (inflammation of the epididymis and the testes due to infection may also have testicular pain as well. The patient may have a history of frequency, dysuria, urethral discharge, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever. Testicular perfusion is normal or increased on imaging studies. Pyuria is often present on urinalysis.

Signs of bowel obstruction (eg, protuberant abdomen, decreased or absent bowel sounds, and vomiting) may also be present. Unlike causes of testicular pain or swelling, the mass extends up to the inguinal ring. Emergency surgical consultation is warranted for such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Incarcerated mass'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scrotal trauma usually is evident from the history. The spectrum of injuries can range from a hematocele (hematoma in the tunica vaginalis) to an intratesticular hematoma to disruption of the tunica albuginea causing testicular rupture. Color Doppler ultrasonography can accurately diagnose the extent of injury. Testicular rupture requires surgical repair. Lesser injuries are managed according to the clinical severity and often can be treated nonoperatively.
