Fractures of the metatarsal shaft are discussed below. Proximal fractures of the fifth metatarsal, metatarsal stress fractures, and toe fractures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-fifth-metatarsal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-metatarsal-shaft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the metatarsal shaft&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toe-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toe fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metatarsal-and-toe-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metatarsal and toe fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excluding toe fractures, metatarsal fractures are the most common foot fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Approximately one-third of metatarsal fractures involve the shaft or distal portion of the metatarsal. Direct blows and twisting injuries cause many of these fractures. In adults, high forces are required to fracture the first metatarsal. Hence, fractures of the first metatarsal shaft are much less common than fractures of the other metatarsal shafts.</p><p>Some populations are at higher risk for traumatic metatarsal fractures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adult women with osteoporosis, decreased physical activity, or benzodiazepine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetics, especially if they have had diabetes for greater than 25 years or are more active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For reference purposes, the metatarsals are numbered from first (largest) to fifth (smallest). The first metatarsal is larger than the others and more important for weight-bearing and balance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924%7EEM%2F61079%7EEM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 graphicRef61079 graphicRef71857 \">figure 1A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F94922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94922 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F94921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94921 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therefore, malalignment of a first metatarsal shaft fracture is not tolerated as well as malalignment of other metatarsal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most fractures of a single metatarsal shaft are minimally displaced due to the splinting action of adjacent metatarsals and their abundant ligamentous and muscle attachments. The likelihood of displacement increases if multiple metatarsals are fractured or the fracture is near the metatarsal head. If displacement occurs, the metatarsal head usually displaces in a plantar direction. This is caused by the downward traction of the intrinsic muscles and flexor tendons that insert distal to the fracture.</p><p>The dorsal soft tissues of the foot are thin compared with the plantar soft tissues. They may become necrotic when crushed or rubbed repeatedly by the apex of a fractured metatarsal, leading to an open fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most metatarsal shaft fractures are caused by direct blows or twisting forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Common mechanisms include heavy objects dropped on the foot and violent blows to the sole of the foot (as may occur during falls or auto accidents). Greater force is required to fracture the first metatarsal due to its large size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with metatarsal fractures typically present with foot pain and have trouble walking. Dorsal swelling and ecchymosis can develop rapidly due to the foot's dependent position, if the injured area is not elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One should inspect for any signs of significant skin damage. If there is any wound near the fracture, the injury should be treated as an open fracture until proven otherwise. Crush injuries, a common cause of metatarsal fractures, may devitalize the skin. The injured skin may then necrose, leading to an open fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurovascular injury of the foot is uncommon without significant trauma or a penetrating injury. However, a neurovascular exam should be performed and documented on every patient with a suspected metatarsal fracture.</p><p>Sequential palpation along each metatarsal can reveal the fracture site. Point tenderness over the site is the norm, but swelling may make it difficult to localize the fracture on physical examination. Furthermore, soft tissue injury may simulate the point tenderness of a fracture, especially when the injury was caused by an object dropped on the foot. Gently applying an axial load to the metatarsal heads can help differentiate fractures from soft tissue injuries. This is done by holding the toe in line with its corresponding metatarsal (ie, without angulation), and pushing the toe in toward the metatarsal. This maneuver should produce pain if the metatarsal is fractured, but not with soft tissue injury alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Assessing pain while testing plantar and dorsal flexion of the toes is helpful for differentiating a fracture from tendon injury. If a metatarsal fracture is present, direct palpation over the fracture site should produce greater pain than testing tendon function by resisting plantar and dorsiflexion.</p><p>The tarso-metatarsal (ie, Lisfranc) joint area should be palpated in all patients with foot injuries. Tenderness in this area raises the possibility of a Lisfranc injury, and referral to an orthopedist should be made. Anatomic reduction of Lisfranc injuries is critical, and inadequately treated injuries can lead to severe disability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compartment syndrome of the foot is a rare but dangerous potential complication of metatarsal fractures, particularly fractures resulting from crush injuries or associated with the first metatarsal (ie, injuries resulting from greater force) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Disproportionate pain, pallor, paresthesias, or tense swelling should prompt the clinician to consider the diagnosis. Pain with passive flexion and extension of toes is an early sign of compartment syndrome. A diminished pulse is a late finding and should not be relied upon for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Measurement of compartment pressure is the only reliable method to determine the presence of compartment syndrome. Pressure greater than 30 mmHg is considered diagnostic and requires emergent surgical release of the compartments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard radiographic assessment includes anterior-posterior (AP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81316\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81316 \">image 1</a>), lateral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73956\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73956 \">image 2</a>), and oblique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77233\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77233 \">image 3</a>) views of the foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. AP and oblique views are often the most helpful. Shadows from overlapping metatarsals may limit the usefulness of lateral views. A modified lateral view, with the metatarsals slightly rotated to avoid overlap, may be helpful when fracture position is difficult to determine with standard views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The most common metatarsal fracture pattern is oblique or transverse with minimal displacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82536\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82536 \">image 4</a>). Multiple fractures, displacement, and comminution can be seen with high-force injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78364\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78364 \">image 5</a>).</p><p>Occasionally, fracture lines may not be detectable on initial radiographs but become visible later (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73984\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73984 \">image 6</a>). Therefore, it is prudent to manage patients as though a fracture is present if clinical findings suggest so, despite normal radiographs. In such cases, the examination and radiographs should be repeated one to two weeks after the initial injury. If point tenderness has resolved and radiographs remain normal, it is extremely unlikely the patient sustained a fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ORTHOPEDIC CONSULTATION OR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate surgical referral is required for all open fractures and for all fractures with associated vascular compromise or nerve injury. Early referral is also recommended for fractures with significant skin damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other indications for referral include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/7,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of multiple metatarsals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78364\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78364 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73984\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73984 \">image 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced fractures near the metatarsal head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52841\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52841 \">image 7</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraarticular fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53195\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53195 \">image 8</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced fractures of the first metatarsal, even if displacement is minimal, because anatomic position is necessary for optimal weight-bearing function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable fractures of the first metatarsal, judged by clinical findings or stress radiographs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent injuries of other structures, including injury of the tarso-metatarsal (ie, Lisfranc) ligament complex and fractures of other foot or ankle bones</p><p/><p>Widely cited guidelines suggest that isolated shaft fractures with greater than 3 to 4 mm displacement in the <span class=\"nowrap\">dorsal/plantar</span> plain or angulation greater than 10 degrees should be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/5,7,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,12-14</a>]. This recommendation does not appear to be supported by any definitive data, and studies exist that question this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. As an example, in a study of 31 ballet dancers with fifth metatarsal shaft fractures, all of whom were treated nonoperatively (even the five patients with displaced fractures), all were able to return to high-level ballet dancing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, reduction or referral appears wise in such cases since this is the current standard of care, and there are insufficient data to refute the traditional approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally and nondisplaced fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the fracture is minimally or nondisplaced and conditions requiring emergent referral have been excluded, initial treatment includes immobilization in a posterior splint and non-weight-bearing with a follow-up visit in three to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The injury should be iced and elevated higher than the level of the heart for the first 24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Displaced fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metatarsal fractures that are displaced laterally or medially usually do well without correction. Metatarsal fractures displaced more than 3 to 4 mm in a dorsal or plantar direction or with angulation greater than 10 degrees in this plane should probably be reduced or referred (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above). Fractures with lesser degrees of dorsal and plantar displacement can be treated as nondisplaced fractures.</p><p>Reduction can frequently be achieved under local anesthesia using either a regional block (particularly useful in patients with multiple metatarsal fractures) or a hematoma block. The latter involves direct injection of local anesthetic into the hematoma that forms at the fracture site.</p><p>Once there is adequate anesthesia, reduction can be achieved by placing the toes in Chinese finger traps and allowing gravity to accomplish the reduction. Applying light weights or manual traction to the distal tibia is sometimes helpful. The reduction should be maintained by a molded, bivalved, non-weight-bearing cast, and postreduction radiographs should be obtained to confirm proper alignment. Referral or consultation with an orthopedist is recommended if the clinician is uncertain about the necessity of reduction or uncomfortable about performing the reduction, or if adequate alignment is not maintained by the reduction and immobilization measures described here.</p><p>Again, the injury should be iced and elevated higher than the level of the heart for the first 24 hours, while keeping the cast dry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally and nondisplaced fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nondisplaced and minimally displaced metatarsal shaft fractures heal well without cast immobilization in most cases. Treatment after the first follow-up visit generally consists of a firm, supportive shoe and progressive weight-bearing as tolerated. A post-op shoe is advised if the patient does not have suitable shoes or the foot is too swollen to fit in supportive shoes.</p><p>A well-molded, short-leg walking cast may be necessary if the patient has significant pain while bearing minimal weight. Generally, a cast is placed several days after the injury when swelling is reduced. Radiographs should be repeated one week after the injury (or during the initial follow-up visit, if this takes place five days or longer after the injury) to assure the fracture remains non-displaced. After two to three weeks, the cast may be replaced with a firm shoe or post-op shoe for two to three additional weeks.</p><p>Most fractures are considered &quot;healed&quot; when callus is visible on radiographs and point tenderness has resolved, which usually occurs by six weeks in adults. Complete healing requires many months. Radiographs should be repeated four to six weeks after the injury to document healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. If callus is seen and the fracture has minimal to no tenderness, protection can be discontinued and regular activities gradually resumed. At this point, the patient will need ankle range of motion and calf <span class=\"nowrap\">strengthening/stretching</span> exercises to speed full recovery of function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Displaced fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Displaced fractures of the metatarsal shafts are usually placed in a bivalved cast acutely. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.) Follow-up the next day is recommended to assure that additional swelling has not made the cast too tight. The patient should return for subsequent follow-up approximately one week after the injury. Radiographs should be obtained at that time in the cast, if it has not become loose. If fracture position remains acceptable, the cast may be reinforced and continued as a non-weight-bearing cast for two to three more weeks. The cast should be replaced if it has become loose. We recommend that radiographs be obtained after placement in the new cast to assure adequate fracture alignment is maintained.</p><p>The patient should be reevaluated with radiographs at three to four weeks after the injury. If the fracture is still in good position, a short-leg walking cast should be applied for three to four weeks with progressive weight-bearing followed by range of motion and <span class=\"nowrap\">strengthening/stretching</span> exercises upon cast removal. Orthopedic consultation is recommended if fracture position is lost at any time during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most metatarsal shaft fractures heal well when treated appropriately, but complications do occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial injury and compartment syndrome may develop acutely in metatarsal shaft fractures and may lead to loss of the foot or ischemic contracture.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-lesions-of-the-skin#H1101420580\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign lesions of the skin&quot;, section on 'Calluses and corns'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex regional pain syndrome may complicate metatarsal shaft fractures.

Otherwise, they should not work until symptoms allow them to perform their job comfortably and safely. Toe and ankle range of motion exercises and gentle calf stretching are generally begun three to four weeks after injury (or one to two days after cast removal, if a cast was placed). Strengthening exercises and gentle walking follow. Patients may engage in fast walking or gentle running once the fracture demonstrates healing and walking is no longer painful. Activities may be gradually advanced as tolerated from there.</p><p>A study of ballet dancers with fifth metatarsal shaft fractures found that patients with non-displaced fractures returned most rapidly to dancing (seven weeks on average) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metatarsal-shaft-fractures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
