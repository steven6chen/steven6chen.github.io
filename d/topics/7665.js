Handwashing with soap and water should be used in association with care of patients with known or suspected norovirus or <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection since alcohol does not kill <em>C. difficile</em> spores or norovirus.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorses a three-step method for AHD (apply sanitizer and rub both palms together, cover all surfaces, and rub until dry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], whereas the WHO endorses a six-step method (apply sanitizer and specifically rub six different aspects of the hands and fingers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a randomized trial comparing these two methods among 120 doctors and nurses at an acute care hospital, those assigned to the six-step method had a greater reduction in the bacterial count of their hands but took approximately 8 seconds longer to complete hand hygiene and had lower compliance (65 versus 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Types of precautions for preventing transmission of infection include standard precautions and isolation precautions. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard precautions should be followed for the care of all patients; refer to the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50001\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50001 \">table 1</a>) and the <a href=\"http://www.md.ucl.ac.be/didac/hosp/Isolation.pdf&amp;token=WPeJe4YGWJi2YwhENW0bBHnbe7EhIwbQ94Q0H2bLR7Qi3KrCtg5A3DL2ZWmBVHAW05FZ/quqMIEfkpcG4Wj7gg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4042\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">table</a> prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control. They include hand hygiene before and after every patient contact, use of gloves, gowns, and eye protection (for situations in which exposure to body fluids is possible), use of respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">hygiene/cough</span> etiquette, and safe disposal of sharp instruments in impervious containers. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Standard precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand hygiene refers to handwashing with soap and water or the use of alcohol-based hand disinfection (AHD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77676 \">table 2</a>). Hand hygiene is the single most important measure to reduce transmission of microorganisms from one person to another or from one site to another on the same patient. Wearing gloves does not replace the need for hand hygiene. (See <a href=\"#H2557723252\" class=\"local\">'Hand hygiene'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2145766068\" class=\"local\">'Gloves'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either soap and water or AHD may be used in most circumstances; we favor AHD because it is more efficient than handwashing with soap and water. Handwashing with soap and water should be used in association with care of patients with known or suspected <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection or norovirus. (See <a href=\"#H2557723252\" class=\"local\">'Hand hygiene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three isolation categories reflect the major modes of pathogen transmission in nosocomial settings: contact, droplet, and airborne spread. The types of precaution(s) warranted for care of patients with known or suspected pathogens are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50001\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50001 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1662125824\" class=\"local\">'Isolation precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Contact precautions &ndash; Healthcare workers should perform hand hygiene and wear gloves upon room entry, even if no direct patient contact is anticipated. Gowns should be worn if there is likely to be direct contact with the patient or any infective material. (See <a href=\"#H954996324\" class=\"local\">'Contact precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Droplet precautions &ndash; Healthcare workers should wear a mask when within six feet of patients on droplet precautions. No special air handling systems or higher level respirator masks are required, and the door may remain open. (See <a href=\"#H356549551\" class=\"local\">'Droplet precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Airborne precautions &ndash; Patients requiring airborne isolation precautions should be placed in an airborne infection isolation room, which should be a private room with negative air pressure and a minimum of 6 to 12 air changes per hour. The door must remain closed, and all individuals who enter must wear a respirator with a filtering capacity of 95 percent that allows a tight seal over the nose and mouth. (See <a href=\"#H130062249\" class=\"local\">'Airborne precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3300939405\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Daniel Sexton, MD, and N Deborah Friedman, MPH, MBBS, FRACP, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Siegel JD, Rhinehart E, Jackson M, et al.
