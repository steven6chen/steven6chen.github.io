There are different types of GBS. The most common type is called &quot;acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,&quot; or &quot;AIDP.&quot; Both children and adults can get GBS.</p><p>In GBS, a person's infection-fighting system attacks his or her own nervous system. This damages the nervous system, which can cause symptoms.</p><p>In people who get GBS, it usually follows a bacterial or viral infection. Common examples include Campylobacter (an illness that causes stomach pain and diarrhea) and HIV infection. In places affected by the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak, there were more cases of GBS than usual. This suggests that Zika infection might trigger GBS in some cases. However, most people who get Zika will not get GBS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15641081\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBS causes muscle weakness on both sides of the body. The weakness usually starts in the legs, and then spreads to the arms and face. Some people have mild weakness, for example, trouble walking. Other people are unable to move the muscles in their legs, arms, or face. This is called &quot;paralysis.&quot; In some people, the muscles used for breathing get very weak. This can make it hard to breathe.</p><p>Other symptoms of GBS can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, especially in the back, legs, or arms</p><p/><p>Less common symptoms of GBS can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with eye movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of coordination in the arms and legs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15641096\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will also do tests to be sure you have GBS. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture, sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot; &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle in the lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will do lab tests on the spinal fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve conduction studies &ndash; This test can show whether the nerves are carrying electrical signals the correct way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography, or &quot;EMG&quot; &ndash; This test shows whether the muscles are responding to the electrical signals from the nerves in the correct way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15641111\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for GBS involves different parts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments for problems caused by the GBS &ndash; People with GBS are usually treated in the hospital. That's because symptoms of GBS can get worse very quickly. In the hospital, the doctor can monitor a person's breathing, heartbeat, and health. Then he or she can treat any problems that come up, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Breathing problems &ndash; People who are having a very hard time breathing usually need a breathing tube. A breathing tube is a tube that goes down the throat and into the lungs. The other end is attached to a machine that helps with breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain &ndash; Doctors can use different medicines to treat pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for the GBS itself &ndash; There is no cure for GBS. But there are 2 different treatments that can help improve symptoms and shorten how long GBS lasts. People with GBS usually have one or the other of these treatments, depending on their individual situation and other factors. These treatments are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IVIG &ndash; This is a medicine that helps strengthen the body's infection-fighting system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plasma exchange (also called &quot;plasmapheresis&quot;) &ndash; For this treatment, a machine pumps blood from the body and removes substances from the blood that are attacking the nervous system. Then the machine returns the blood to the body.</p><p/><p>Children with GBS usually have the same treatments as adults. But doctors usually use IVIG or plasma exchange only if children have severe symptoms.</p><p>People whose muscles get very weak might need &quot;rehab.&quot; During rehab, doctors, nurses, and other health professionals show people ways to strengthen their muscles and move their bodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15641126\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome last?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBS usually lasts a few weeks. After that, the symptoms slowly get better over weeks to months.</p><p>Most people will recover completely from their GBS and have no long-term muscle weakness. But some people have muscle weakness that lasts years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15641141\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
