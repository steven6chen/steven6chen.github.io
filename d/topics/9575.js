Bacterial joint infections can be caused by a number of different organisms and can occur in both natural and artificial joints (eg, after a knee replacement).</p><p>A common type of joint infection is caused by <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, the sexually transmitted bacteria that cause gonorrhea; this is called a gonococcal joint infection. Joint infection with other types of bacteria, such as <em>Staphylococcus</em>, is called nongonococcal bacterial (septic) arthritis. Infection of an artificial joint is known as prosthetic joint infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GONOCOCCAL JOINT INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonococcal joint infection symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person who becomes infected with gonorrhea but does not receive early treatment can develop joint pain, especially in the wrist, fingers, ankles, and toes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). This is called disseminated gonococcal infection, or DGI.</p><p>Symptoms can also include fever (temperature &gt;100.4&ordm;F, or 38&ordm;C), chills, and feeling ill. A skin rash can develop and may be mild (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67183\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67183 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>In other people, the knees, wrists, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ankles become painful and swollen due to collections of pus inside the joint. More than one joint may be affected at the same time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonococcal joint infection diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider may use a syringe and needle to remove fluid from the joint to analyze it for signs of infection and bacteria. Blood tests and a test for gonorrhea are also usually recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonococcal joint infection treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of gonococcal joint infections generally requires intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics may be used in selected situations. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of the infection and varies from three days to two weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">BACTERIAL (NONGONOCOCCAL) ARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nongonococcal arthritis is an infection of a joint caused by bacteria other than <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> (the bacteria that causes gonorrhea). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The bacteria usually enter the joint from the bloodstream. Any bacteria may be involved, but various forms of <em>Staphylococcus</em> are the most common.</p><p>Nongonococcal bacterial arthritis is a potentially dangerous form of arthritis that can destroy a joint if not treated promptly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial arthritis symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of nongonococcal arthritis usually include sudden pain and swelling in one or more joints. A fever may or may not be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial arthritis diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A healthcare provider may use a needle and syringe to withdraw fluid from the joint. The fluid will be analyzed in a laboratory for bacteria and white blood cells. In some cases, this procedure will be done in the operating room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial arthritis treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of bacterial arthritis includes antibiotics, drainage of the joint fluid, and physical therapy to maintain joint motion.</p><p>In most cases, antibiotics are given into a vein initially and then by mouth. Intravenous (IV) therapy is usually started in a healthcare provider's office or hospital. Treatment can be continued at home and monitored by a visiting or home health nurse. During home IV therapy, it is important to monitor yourself for signs of infection or inflammation at the site of the IV line (pain, redness, and swelling) and signs of a blood clot in the vein (pain and swelling in the arm or armpit). Drainage of the joint fluid may require repeated needle aspiration or, for some deep joints (eg, hip, shoulder), surgical placement of a drainage tube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTIFICIAL JOINT INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have artificial joints are at risk of developing a joint infection. Approximately 0.5 to 1 percent of people with replacement joints will develop such an infection. Infections can occur early in the course of recovery from joint replacement surgery (within the first two months) or much later. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Total knee replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, artificial joint infections are hard to treat. This is due, at least in part, to the development of a structure called a biofilm within the joint. A biofilm develops when bacteria adhere to the solid surface of the artificial joint. The biofilm can act as a kind of shield to some of the bacteria, making it difficult for the bacteria to be found and destroyed by the body's defenses or by antibiotic medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial joint infection symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who develop infections immediately after joint replacement surgery typically have pain, redness, and swelling at the joint or drainage from the wound. Those who develop infections later usually notice a gradual onset of joint pain, often without fever or other obvious signs of joint infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial joint infection diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artificial joint infections can be difficult to diagnose because the pain is similar to that of other complications of joint replacement surgery. Analysis of the joint fluid is helpful to rule out infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial joint infection treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, treatment of artificial joint infections is difficult. Treatment usually includes a long course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics and surgery to remove infected tissue. In many cases, the artificial joint must be removed, at least temporarily.</p><p>After a period of antibiotic treatment and once the infection is controlled, a new prosthesis may be placed. However, in some cases, it is not possible to replace the prosthetic joint, and surgery to fuse the bones is recommended instead.
