Immunocompetent persons with primary infection are usually asymptomatic. However, in some immunocompetent hosts, <em>T. gondii</em> infection can present as an acute systemic infection or as ocular disease (eg, posterior uveitis). </p><p>After initial infection (even if asymptomatic), latent infection can persist for the life of the host. Immunocompromised individuals (eg, those with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS)</span> can have reactivation of latent infection; such patients typically present with multiple central nervous system abscess-like, round processes with ring enhancement.</p><p>Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent persons will be reviewed here. Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected individuals, pregnant women, and neonates is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-toxoplasmosis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital toxoplasmosis: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28186336\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537014252\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three main <em>T. gondii</em> genotypes (types I, II, and III), which are prevalent in different geographic areas, and can impact the clinical presentation of <em>T. gondii</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, in Europe, where genotype II is present, 80 to 90 percent of individuals who become infected are asymptomatic. This is in contrast to South and Central America, where other genotypes are present, and infection is associated with a higher rate and increased severity of disease, such as retinochoroiditis in immunocompetent adults and children with congenital disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A mix of genotype I and II are the most prevalent in North America.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1131788677\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The seroprevalence of <em>T. gondii</em> infection ranges widely depending upon the geographic area. Seroepidemiologic surveys in the United States report that 11 percent of persons aged 6 to 49 are seropositive for <em>T. gondii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], whereas the seroprevalence is as high as 78 percent in some areas of Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, the prevalence is higher in non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites, and in persons born outside the United States. For persons aged 12 to 49 born in the United States, the seroprevalence declined from 14 to 9 percent between 1999 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1131788570\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Felines are the only animals in which <em>T. gondii</em> can complete its reproductive cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Following feline ingestion of any of the forms of <em>T. gondii</em>, the parasite infects the gut epithelial cells and reproduces. The feline then excretes infectious oocysts in feces.</p><p>When non-felines (mammals and birds), including humans, ingest <em>T. gondii</em> oocysts, the organisms invade intestinal epithelium and disseminate throughout the body. They then encyst in any type of nucleated cell and lie dormant within tissues for the life of the host.</p><p>There are four means of acquiring toxoplasmosis in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of infectious oocysts from the environment (usually from soil or fresh water sources contaminated with feline feces)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of tissue cysts in meat from an infected animal or from contaminated fruits or vegetables</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertical transmission from an infected mother to her fetus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission through an organ transplantation from an infected donor</p><p/><p>In most resource-limited settings, infection is typically acquired through environmental exposures, such as water from lakes and streams, since meats are usually not eaten undercooked. However, ingestion of undercooked meat is responsible for the majority of toxoplasmosis cases in Nepal, Europe, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. </p><p>In a case-control study that was conducted from 2002 to 2007 in the United States, a multivariate analysis found that <em>T. gondii</em> infection was associated with eating raw or undercooked foods (ground beef and lamb) and drinking unpasteurized goat's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, working with meat or owning three or more kittens was associated with an increased risk of infection. Eating undercooked venison or consumption of deer blood by hunters is also a possible source in the United States. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1131788510\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE SYSTEMIC INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunocompetent persons with primary infection are usually asymptomatic. However, in some immunocompetent hosts, <em>T. gondii</em> infection can present as an acute systemic infection, which typically develops 5 to 23 days after exposure to the organism. Most immunocompetent patients who develop symptoms have a benign, self-limited course that typically lasts from a few weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3649683807\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.) </p><p>The diagnosis is typically made through serologic testing. Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated in individuals with severe or prolonged infection. (See <a href=\"#H28183708\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28186526\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3649683807\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351338969\"><span class=\"h3\">General symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute toxoplasmosis typically present with constitutional symptoms, such as fever, chills, and sweats; however, these symptoms are generally mild, and the febrile episodes usually last two to three days. Headaches, myalgias, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a diffuse non-pruritic maculopapular rash may also occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351338963\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical manifestation of acute toxoplasmosis is bilateral, symmetrical, nontender cervical adenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Approximately 20 to 30 percent develop generalized lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes are usually smaller than 3 centimeters in size and are nonfluctuant. Unlike the fever, which lasts for a short duration, lymphadenopathy can persist for weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351338995\"><span class=\"h3\">Uncommon manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On rare occasions, immunocompetent patients may present with severe disease such as pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], polymyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], hepatitis, posterior uveitis, or encephalitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H943001517\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory findings are nonspecific in patients with toxoplasmosis. Patients may have a slight lymphocytosis with or without atypical cells. If atypical lymphocytes are present, they usually account for less than 10 percent of the total leukocyte count. Hepatic transaminases may also be slightly elevated, and there may be moderate increases in the C-reactive protein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347509177\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathologic examination of lymph nodes typically reveals follicular hyperplasia, focal distension of sinuses with monocytoid cells, and irregular clusters of tissue macrophages with eosinophilic cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Granulomata and abscesses are not seen. </p><p>Tachyzoites have been identified on fine needle aspiration specimens from patients with toxoplasmic lymphadenitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although tachyzoites are difficult to demonstrate with standard stains, they may be observed with immunoperoxidase or fluorescent antibody stains. Parasites may also be detectable with DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection#H10843290\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for toxoplasmosis infection&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction assays'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28183708\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis should be considered in immunocompetent hosts who present with an acute onset of fever and lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H3649683807\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Serologic testing is typically used to determine if a patient has toxoplasmosis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is most commonly used due to overall performance and cost. In acute infection, IgM antibodies usually appear within one week of symptom onset and continue to rise. Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies subsequently follow within approximately two weeks of primary infection, peak within approximately eight weeks, and generally persist for life. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, the diagnosis is eliminated if the patient has no evidence of either IgM or IgG antibodies. However, for those who present within one week of symptom onset, a repeat test should be performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has IgM antibodies detected without the presence of IgG antibodies, the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is likely. However, a positive IgG antibody obtained approximately two weeks later is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The IgM-antibody reaction is usually considered a false-positive if IgM antibodies persist without the development of IgG antibodies after three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If serial testing of two samples two weeks apart is not enough to establish whether the patient has had a recent infection, samples can be analyzed with an IgG-avidity assay. DNA amplification of toxoplasma using PCR testing of blood can also confirm acute infection; however, the sensitivity varies, and may be as low as 53 percent in patients with acute toxoplasmic lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>A more detailed discussion of serologic testing is found elsewhere.

Thus, acute toxoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with fever and adenopathy. </p><p>Alternative diagnoses include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epstein-Barr virus infection</strong> &ndash; Acute toxoplasmosis and EBV infection can both present with adenopathy and atypical lymphocytosis. However, patients with EBV are more likely to present with pharyngitis and tonsillitis. The diagnosis for both infections is typically made through serologic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytomegalovirus infection</strong> &ndash; Both toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can cause a mono-like syndrome in immunocompetent adults. However, enlarged cervical nodes are not as common in patients with CMV disease. Serologic testing is typically used to diagnose CMV infection in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute HIV</strong> &ndash; Many of the symptoms of acute toxoplasmosis overlap with the symptoms of acute HIV infection (eg, fever and generalized lymphadenopathy). Early HIV infection should be suspected in patients who have had a recent high-risk exposure (eg, sexual or unsafe needle sharing); however, the absence of elicited risk factors should not preclude the possibility of HIV infection since some patients may not disclose this information. Diagnostic testing for acute HIV infection generally includes the use of a combination <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/antibody</span> immunoassay as well as a measurement of the HIV viral load. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tularemia</strong> &ndash; Tularemia should be considered in patients with fever and adenopathy if they are at risk of exposure to <em>Francisella tularensis (</em>eg, farmers, veterinarians, hunters, landscapers, and meat handlers). However, unlike toxoplasmosis where the adenopathy is typically bilateral and nontender, patients with glandular tularemia generally have tender regional lymphadenopathy involving single or multiple nodes. The diagnosis of tularemia is based upon serologic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-tularemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of tularemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cat scratch disease</strong> &ndash; Cat scratch disease (CSD) due to <em>Bartonella henselae</em> should be considered in individuals (particularly children) with fever and adenopathy. However, unlike toxoplasmosis, the nodes are almost always tender, have erythema of the overlying skin, and are occasionally suppurative. In addition, the location of the lymphadenopathy depends on the site of the inoculation; the most common locations are the axillary, epitrochlear, cervical, supraclavicular, and submandibular lymph nodes. Serology is typically used to diagnose CSD.

Patients with tuberculosis typically have a chronic presentation, and the physical examination reveals a firm, discrete mass or matted nodes fixed to surrounding structures; the overlying skin may be indurated. Diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis is established by histopathology examination along with acid-fast bacilli smear and culture of lymph node material. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-lymphadenitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous lymphadenitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Noninfectious causes</strong> &ndash; Other considerations in the differential diagnosis include noninfectious diseases such as sarcoidosis, Hodgkin disease, and lymphoma.

However, we suggest treatment for those with severe or prolonged symptoms (eg, beyond a few weeks) and those with evidence of pneumonitis, myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, posterior uveitis, or polymyositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].
