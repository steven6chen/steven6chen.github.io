It's the same kind of contraction that happens during labor and childbirth. Contractions during a period are normal. But, they can be painful. The medical name for painful periods is &quot;dysmenorrhea.&quot;</p><p>Some medical conditions can make the pain during your period worse. The most common one is called &quot;endometriosis.&quot; In this condition, tissues that should grow only in the uterus grow outside the uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213736704\"><span class=\"h1\">What do painful periods feel like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with painful periods have cramping in the lower belly. The cramps can be mild or bad. You might also have pain in your back or thighs. Pain often starts with your period or right before your period.</p><p>Some women also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating (a feeling of fullness in the belly)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213736711\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take pain medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Motrin or Advil) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (brand name: Aleve). Start taking them as soon as symptoms of your period begin. Keep taking them for 2 or 3 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower belly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise on a regular basis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213736718\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain is getting worse </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicine isn't helping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You also have pain well before or well after your period</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213736725\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation.</p><p>Most women need only a physical exam. In the exam, your doctor will check the size and shape of your vagina, cervix, uterus, and ovaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). If the exam isn't normal or pain medicine doesn't help, your doctor might do other tests. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to make a picture of your uterus, ovaries, and vagina to see if they look normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests for infections that you catch during sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopy &ndash; This is a type of surgery. The doctor will put you to sleep and make a small cut just below your belly button. Then, he or she will use a thin tool with a camera on it to see inside your belly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213736732\"><span class=\"h1\">How are painful periods treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your painful periods.
