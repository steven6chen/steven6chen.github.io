This abnormal alpha- to beta-chain ratio causes the unpaired chains to precipitate and causes destruction of red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis) and circulation (hemolysis). As a result, affected individuals have variable degrees of anemia and extramedullary hematopoiesis, which in turn can cause bone changes, impaired growth, and iron overload.</p><p>This topic review discusses the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alpha and beta thalassemia, the two most common forms.

It has been estimated that 5 percent of the world's population has at least one thalassemia variant allele, with as many as 900,000 individuals with clinically significant disease expected during the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, the majority in Southern China, India, and Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha thalassemia</strong> &ndash; Alpha thalassemia is highly prevalent in Southern China, Malaysia, and Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Mild forms are also commonly encountered in individuals of African origin. As noted above, individuals with Asian ancestry may carry the alpha thalassemia-1 trait (ie, two alpha gene deletions in cis; <span class=\"nowrap\">aa/--);</span> thus, these individuals are at greater risk of hydrops fetalis. Individuals of African ancestry typically carry the alpha thalassemia-2 trait (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">a-/a-)</span> and thus are unlikely to develop hydrops fetalis. (See <a href=\"#H2697253778\" class=\"local\">'Alpha thalassemias'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta thalassemia</strong> &ndash; Beta thalassemia is highly prevalent in Africa. The estimated rate of heterozygosity in the population is approximately 13 percent in Africa, 4 percent in Asia, and 2 percent in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Immigration has contributed to greater ethnic diversity of affected individuals and increased prevalence of thalassemia in other countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1271747666\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW AND TYPICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thalassemia (from the Greek word thalassa [sea]) refers to a group of inherited hemoglobinopathies that arose in certain regions of the world (parts of Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean region) in which malaria was (or is) endemic. These disorders are characterized by reduced production of the alpha or beta chains used for assembly of the hemoglobin molecule (ie, a quantitative defect in globin chain production).</p><p>The imbalance in the normal ratio of alpha to beta (or beta-like) chains leads to precipitation of the excess unpaired chains (excess alpha chains in beta thalassemia; excess gamma and beta chains in alpha thalassemia [during late gestation and after the first six months of life, respectively]). The precipitated chains damage developing red blood cell (RBC) precursors, especially in beta thalassemia, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis. Circulating erythrocytes may also be affected, causing hemolytic anemia. Hemolysis is present in both alpha and beta thalassemia, although in beta thalassemia, it may be overshadowed by ineffective erythropoiesis. The severity and clinical features of each thalassemia syndrome is determined by the amount and chemical nature (especially solubility) of the excess unpaired globin chains and the consequent effects on RBC production. Details of the mechanism and consequences of globin precipitation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of the thalassemic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thalassemias can be described by genotype (eg, beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia) or clinical phenotype (eg, beta thalassemia major). Genotype and phenotype generally correlate well, with phenotypes becoming more severe the greater the reduction in functional globin chains produced. However, there is significant variability in some cases, especially in individuals with a thalassemia intermedia phenotype. This has led to a shift in the way these disorders are conceptualized to focus on whether they are transfusion-dependent or transfusion-independent, which is reflected in the discussions below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Other factors that alter the course of disease in these individuals include the patient's age, other genetic variants (eg, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin [HPFH], a concurrent hemoglobin mutation that ameliorates or exacerbates symptoms), other medical conditions (eg, liver disease), environmental factors such as oxidant exposure, and therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4129956788\" class=\"local\">'Causes of variability in disease manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2697253778\"><span class=\"h2\">Alpha thalassemias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four alpha globin genes, encoded by an adjacent pair on each chromosome, as depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>). Alpha thalassemia is typically caused by gene deletions rather than mutations in one or more of these genes. There are many possible combinations of alpha thalassemia genotypes, with two basic principles that determine the clinical phenotype. First, the severity of phenotype increases with loss of one, two, three, or four functioning alpha globin alleles. Second, nondeletional mutant alleles such as hemoglobin constant spring (CS) tend to be associated with more severe phenotypes than the deletional alleles at equivalent levels of gene loss; the reason for this is not well understood. The genotypes of the common alpha thalassemia syndromes and their phenotypic descriptions are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115337 \">table 1</a>) and described in the following sections.</p><p>The other major consideration in alpha thalassemia phenotypes is co-inheritance of beta globin mutations (beta thalassemia mutations, which reduce beta globin production, or the sickle mutation, which results in abnormal beta globin). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-variant-sickle-cell-syndromes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of variant sickle cell syndromes&quot;, section on 'Sickle-alpha thalassemia'</a> and <a href=\"#H4129956788\" class=\"local\">'Causes of variability in disease manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>A condition known as acquired hemoglobin H disease can occur with clonal evolution of a hematopoietic stem cell with an alpha thalassemia mutation (eg, in a myelodysplastic syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H4008672\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Acquired hemoglobin H disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1291863480\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrops fetalis and hemoglobin Barts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loss of all four alpha globin genes <span class=\"nowrap\">(--/--)</span> leads to severe anemia during fetal development with hydrops fetalis; typically this is incompatible with live birth. This condition results from co-inheritance of alpha thalassemia-1 trait <span class=\"nowrap\">(aa/--)</span> from both parents. The only hemoglobin produced is hemoglobin Barts (Hb Barts; ie, tetramers of gamma globin). Individuals with this condition cannot produce any normal fetal hemoglobin (HbF; the major hemoglobin produced after the first six to eight weeks of gestation) or adult hemoglobin (HbA; ie, they have no HbF, HbA, or HbA<sub>2</sub>). Hb Barts cannot deliver oxygen to the tissues because its affinity for oxygen is too high (at least 10 times greater than HbA). The hydropic state in the fetus reflects the existence of massive total body edema due to high-output heart failure. Fetal death usually occurs during the late-second through mid-third trimester of pregnancy or within a few hours of birth. Occasional live births have been reported, some following use of intrauterine transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Mothers of fetuses with hydrops fetalis are at risk for the development of polyhydramnios and a variety of other obstetrical complications.

The genotype can be &quot;deletional&quot; (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">--/a-)</span> or nondeletional (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">--/aa<sup>t</sup>),</span> in which the &quot;t&quot; stands for a mutant alpha chain such as Hb constant spring (HbCS), the most common form of nondeletional HbH disease. Deletional forms are more common in individuals from Africa and Asia; nondeletional forms are more common in those with Mediterranean heritage. Both HbA and HbH (ie, tetramers of beta globin) are produced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of the thalassemic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Failed translation termination: Hb constant spring'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical severity in HbH disease is variable. Affected individuals are usually symptomatic at birth and have a thalassemia intermedia phenotype (ie, they are typically transfusion-independent) but can deteriorate into transfusion dependence. These individuals typically have mild anemia (typical hemoglobin range, approximately 9 to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> typical mean corpuscular volume [MCV], 62 to 77 fL) and neonatal jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. However, there is marked clinical variability, ranging from severe anemia with fetal hydrops to an asymptomatic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Individuals with HbH disease due to co-inheritance of the cis-deletional form of alpha thalassemia from one parent and HbCS from the other parent <span class=\"nowrap\">(--/aa<sup>CS</sup>)</span> tend to have more severe disease than those with deletional HbH disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(--/-a)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Individuals with HbH disease usually are not transfusion-dependent, but many will require episodic transfusions during periods of increased hemolysis (eg, due to infection), pregnancy (with dilutional anemia), or aplastic crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because HbH is readily oxidized, the RBCs are susceptible to oxidant stress such as infection or oxidizing drugs. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of individuals with HbH disease have received at least one transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H4153767993\" class=\"local\">'Anemia'</a> below.)</p><p>The majority of individuals with HbH disease (approximately 70 percent) develop complications associated with ineffective erythropoiesis and extramedullary hematopoiesis, including some degree of iron overload by adulthood, even with minimal or no transfusion history, and hepatosplenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. A smaller percentage (10 to 20 percent) have other symptoms related to chronic hemolysis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, or iron overload, such as gallstones, bone deformities, or growth impairment, respectively. Leg ulcers are also common.

The genotype can be heterozygosity for the alpha thalassemia-1 trait (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">aa/--;</span> more common in individuals with Asian ancestry) or homozygosity for the alpha thalassemia-2 trait (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">a-/a-;</span> more common in individuals of African ancestry), as well as other variants that result in mildly reduced alpha chain production. This is a clinically mild condition characterized by mild anemia, hypochromia, and microcytosis without other clinically obvious manifestations.</p><p>The loss of a single alpha-chain gene (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">a-/aa)</span> causes alpha thalassemia minima (also called silent carrier). This is a benign carrier state; affected individuals are not anemic, their RBCs are not microcytic (although mild hypochromia may be noted on the blood smear), and their hemoglobin analysis is normal.</p><p>These conditions may remain undiagnosed, or they may be detected incidentally on a routine complete blood count during evaluation of an unrelated condition or in the setting of preconception testing and counseling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1644929510\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta thalassemias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two beta globin genes (one on each chromosome). Beta thalassemia is caused by mutations in one or both of these genes; the mutations can result in reduced expression (beta<sup>+</sup>) or complete absence of expression (beta<sup>0</sup>). The severity of disease correlates with the amount of normal beta globin production. Because beta globin expression begins during infancy (gamma globin is the beta-like chain used in fetal and early infant hemoglobins), the thalassemia phenotype generally begins to manifest during the first year of life (typical age of presentation, four to six months); newborns are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

This is caused by homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia mutations or, in rare cases, beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia mutations with extremely low production of beta globin chains. The other major cause is compound heterozygosity for hemoglobin E (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">HbE/beta</span> thalassemia); HbE is a beta<sup>+</sup> type of mutation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to hemoglobin mutations&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin E'</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with beta thalassemia major have profound and lifelong transfusion-dependent anemia. Symptoms typically begin to manifest during late infancy (approximate age, 6 to 12 months); newborns are not symptomatic because their major hemoglobin is fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which uses gamma chains instead of beta chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. Presentations can be remarkably heterogeneous depending on other mitigating factors and the aggressiveness of therapy.</p><p>Untreated, beta thalassemia major presents dramatically with pallor, jaundice and dark urine from hemolysis, irritability from anemia, and abdominal swelling from hepatosplenomegaly. This is followed by symptoms related to severe anemia, including high-output heart failure, failure to thrive, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], and expanding sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis, including skeletal abnormalities of the face and long bones, hepatosplenomegaly, and kidney enlargement. Late symptoms are mostly related to complications of iron overload, which can affect the heart, liver, endocrine organs, and others. (See <a href=\"#H3003303469\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Mortality is high without treatment; as many as 85 percent of untreated individuals will die by the age of five years, mostly from cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. By contrast, an individual diagnosed early in life who has access to aggressive therapy, including hypertransfusion, iron chelation, and, in some cases, hematopoietic cell transplantation, may have substantially less severe symptoms, and survival into the fourth, fifth, and sixth decades is increasingly seen.

Symptoms in the individuals with beta thalassemia trait were similar to those with mild microcytic anemia of other causes and were not influenced by knowledge of the beta thalassemia trait diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4129956788\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of variability in disease manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, a major determinant of disease severity is the number of functional globin genes and the degree of imbalance in the ratio of alpha to beta globin. This can happen in individuals who co-inherit an alpha thalassemia and a beta thalassemia variant. Combinations of alpha and beta globin variants that improve the ratio of alpha to beta globin (ie, make it more even) are likely to reduce the burden of excess chains and may partially ameliorate the disease phenotype. Thus, beta thalassemia trait may mask alpha thalassemia trait.</p><p>The proportion of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, composed of two alpha chains and two gamma chains) can affect disease severity in individuals with beta thalassemia. This may occur in individuals with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). The beneficial effect is due to a greater concentration of unaffected globin chains because the beta thalassemia mutation is not present in the gamma globin chains used to make HbF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

As an example, hepatosplenomegaly may be due to a combination of chronic hemolysis, extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen, and hepatic iron deposition; in decades past, hepatitis virus infection from transfusions also contributed. Growth impairment may be exacerbated by chronic anemia, effects of extramedullary hematopoiesis on bones, and endocrine dysfunction from excessive iron stores affecting growth and puberty. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by a combination of cardiac iron overload and thromboembolic events.

As an example, an individual with beta thalassemia major who receives chronic transfusions without chelation therapy may develop severe iron overload in childhood, whereas some children with beta thalassemia major who receive adequate iron chelation starting in childhood may remain free of excess iron stores. Thalassemia intermedia is often associated with iron overload in adulthood.

This is especially true in thalassemia major and intermedia, but it may also occur in thalassemia minor. By contrast, the reticulocyte count may be surprisingly low for the severity of anemia, especially in beta thalassemia major. An increased RBC count is often helpful in distinguishing thalassemia from iron deficiency anemia, although other testing is required.

It is also important to note that some laboratory cell counters will misclassify nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) as WBCs. Mild cytopenias secondary to hypersplenism may develop later in the disease course; the age at which they develop depends on the severity of hemolysis and iron overload as well as concomitant conditions such as hepatitis virus infection. WBCs, platelets, and NRBCs may be dramatically increased following splenectomy.</p><p/><p>Other laboratory studies that are routinely done to evaluate hemolytic anemia include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, haptoglobin, and Coombs testing. In thalassemia major and intermedia, this testing will demonstrate non-immune hemolysis, with high LDH, high indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and negative Coombs testing. If the diagnosis of thalassemia is very likely, the Coombs testing may be omitted. The other testing for hemolysis (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin) is useful as a baseline for monitoring the course of the disease and the response to therapy. In thalassemia minor, there is not typically evidence of hemolysis (overt or on laboratory testing).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing#H2758698884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods for hemoglobin analysis and hemoglobinopathy testing&quot;, section on 'Patient with suspected thalassemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing#H2965916570\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods for hemoglobin analysis and hemoglobinopathy testing&quot;, section on 'Molecular (DNA-based) methods'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta thalassemias</strong> &ndash; In beta thalassemia major and intermedia, HPLC performed on a blood sample will show increased HbF and HbA<sub>2</sub>. Beta thalassemia trait is also characterized by an increased HbA<sub>2</sub> level (approximate level, 5 percent) and increased HbF in some individuals; the major hemoglobin is HbA (&gt;90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. However, the HbA<sub>2</sub> level may be normal in some individuals with delta-beta or gamma-delta-beta thalassemia trait or when beta thalassemia trait is co-inherited with a delta globin gene mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias/abstract/118-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">118-120</a>]. Thus, a normal HbA<sub>2</sub> level does not eliminate the possibility of beta thalassemia trait.</p><p/><p>If individuals with thalassemia have received a transfusion in the preceding three to four months, some of the transfused blood will be included in the sample used for hemoglobin analysis, which will increase the proportion of HbA and decrease the relative proportions of the other hemoglobins.</p><p>More complex patterns may be associated with co-inheritance of the sickle hemoglobin mutation or other abnormal hemoglobins, as discussed separately.

The diagnosis of alpha thalassemia minor or minima can only be made by DNA testing, and DNA testing is usually required to confirm the diagnoses of HbH disease and less common forms of beta thalassemia such as delta-beta or gamma-delta-beta thalassemia.

While hypochromic microcytic anemia is the hallmark of the thalassemia syndromes and virtually all patients requiring clinical management will exhibit these findings, the silent carrier state in relatives (most commonly alpha-2 thalassemia trait) will often be normochromic. (See <a href=\"#H2054427298\" class=\"local\">'Alpha thalassemia minor or minima'</a> above.)</p><p>In settings in which DNA testing is not available, the diagnosis of the more severe forms can be inferred based on the results from hemoglobin analysis as described above.

Other causes of microcytic anemia and other causes of target cells may also require consideration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1718335\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency (or iron deficiency anemia) is the other major cause of microcytic anemia besides thalassemia. Like the more severe forms of thalassemia (thalassemia major and intermedia), iron deficiency anemia is a microcytic anemia that, in its more severe forms, can be associated with markedly abnormal red blood cell (RBC) morphologies including <span class=\"nowrap\">hypochromic/microcytic</span> cells, target cells, and other abnormal morphologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267 \">picture 6</a>). There are other similarities and differences, and, in the vast majority of cases, iron studies are required regardless of which diagnosis is considered to be most likely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume</strong> &ndash; Like thalassemia minor, milder forms of iron deficiency can cause microcytosis with mild anemia (eg, hemoglobin level &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> or a normal hemoglobin level. However, in mild iron deficiency, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is rarely below 80 fL, whereas an MCV below 75 fL is common in thalassemia minor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RBC count</strong> &ndash; Unlike thalassemia, in which the RBC count is high, the RBC count is typically low in iron deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RDW</strong> &ndash; Unlike thalassemia, in which the red cell distribution width (RDW) is typically low (reflecting a uniform population of small RBCs), in iron deficiency, the RDW tends to be large, reflecting the considerable heterogeneity of RBC sizes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood smear</strong> &ndash; Like thalassemia, in iron deficiency, the peripheral blood smear may show microcytosis and, in more severe cases, target cells. However, the abundance of target cells tends to be greater in thalassemia than in iron deficiency. Unlike thalassemia, in which teardrop-shaped RBCs are often seen, in iron deficiency, teardrop cells are absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> &ndash; Unlike thalassemia, iron deficiency does not cause splenomegaly or bony changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iron studies</strong> &ndash; Unlike thalassemia, which is often associated with excess iron stores (in thalassemia major and intermedia) or normal iron stores (in thalassemia minor), in iron deficiency anemia the iron studies will show low serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation. Although thalassemia is more likely to be associated with iron overload than iron deficiency.</p><p/><p>The evaluation and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are discussed separately.

Levels of ferritin will be normal or increased. An inflammatory, infectious, or malignant disease is usually the underlying cause. Unlike thalassemia, most individuals with anemia of chronic disease will have normocytic anemia. Unlike thalassemia, anemia of chronic disease does not produce abnormalities on hemoglobin analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other inherited anemias</strong> &ndash; A number of other inherited anemias also exhibit abnormal RBC morphologies. Examples include pyruvate kinase deficiency, unstable hemoglobin disorders, and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Like thalassemia, there may be a positive family history of anemia. Unlike thalassemia, in most other inherited anemias, the RBC count is not increased, microcytosis is absent or mild, skeletal changes are absent, and hemoglobin analysis does not show the typical findings for alpha thalassemia (Hb Barts, HbH) or beta thalassemia (increased fetal hemoglobin [HbF] or HbA<sub>2</sub>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver disease and other causes of target cells</strong> &ndash; Liver disease can cause anemia with target cells on the peripheral blood smear, which are due to excess membrane lipids. Target cells may also be seen postsplenectomy and in other disorders that affect the lipid content of the RBC membrane. Like thalassemia, these conditions may be associated with anemia, and some cases of liver disease may be accompanied by iron overload. Unlike thalassemia, these conditions are acquired and typically present in adulthood. Unlike thalassemia, these conditions will not show manifestations of extramedullary hematopoiesis and will have normal findings on hemoglobin analysis.</p><p/><p>Other, less-common causes of microcytic anemia are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59035 \">table 3</a>), and more extensive discussions of the causes of microcytosis and target cells are presented separately.

The common syndromes and their genotypes are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115337 \">table 1</a>) and described above. There has been a shift in the way thalassemias are classified and conceptualized, to focus on whether the affected individual is transfusion-dependent or transfusion-independent. This is mostly determined by genotype, but other factors can modulate disease severity. (See <a href=\"#H1271747666\" class=\"local\">'Overview and typical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of the thalassemia syndromes range from asymptomatic carrier status to profound abnormalities including severe anemia; features of extramedullary hematopoiesis such as skeletal changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115330 \">picture 1</a>) and hepatosplenomegaly; complications of iron overload including cardiac, pulmonary, and endocrine dysfunction; growth impairment; thrombosis; and leg ulcers. Disease severity is mostly inversely correlated with the number of functioning globin chains.

The timing of anemia onset (at birth versus in older infancy or childhood) and the family history may be helpful in distinguishing between alpha and beta thalassemia.

In thalassemia minor the CBC may be normal or show mild anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microcytosis. Iron studies are required to evaluate for iron deficiency and iron overload and to ensure that hemoglobin analysis is accurate. In appropriate patients, hemoglobin analysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic testing is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis. Hb Barts (gamma chain tetramers) or HbH (beta chain tetramers) are consistent with alpha thalassemia; increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) or HbA<sub>2</sub> are consistent with a beta thalassemia syndrome but not specific.
