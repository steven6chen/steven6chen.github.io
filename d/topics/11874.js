Treatment of PD can be divided into nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical therapy. A useful algorithm for the management of PD has been published by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the nonpharmacologic management of PD. The pharmacologic treatment of PD and the treatment of comorbid problems associated with it are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prospect of having a chronic and progressive neurologic disease is frightening. Many individuals are familiar with Parkinson disease (PD) and may even have had first-hand acquaintance with its disabling effects in an affected family member or friend. Education is essential in order to provide the patient and family with some understanding and control over the disorder.</p><p>However, caution should be exercised in newly diagnosed patients with mild symptoms and an uncertain future with regard to progression; early overexposure to potentially disturbing material may be counterproductive. Focused education surrounding particular symptoms may be more effective and is available through books and other materials (see <a href=\"#H20474307\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below) written for the lay audience, through national and regional Parkinson disease organizations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66006 \">table 1</a>), which publish educational pamphlets and organize symposia for patients and families, and through the internet. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emotional and psychologic needs of the patient with PD and family should be addressed. Normal reactions of anger, depression, anxiety, and social and economic concerns often begin with the onset of the disease and evolve as it progresses. Support for the caregiver is particularly important as he or she learns to cope with the increasing needs of the spouse or parent, or more rarely, a son or daughter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Support groups are especially valuable for allowing interactions with other patients or families with similar experiences and for providing access to useful educational information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>For patients with early PD, referral to another affected patient or family may be less overwhelming than a large support group composed of patients with advanced disease. Young-onset PD groups also have been formed in some locales, and a young-onset PD handbook is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are also some national support organizations, several of which have local chapters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66006 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Referral of the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family to a psychologist or psychiatric social worker experienced in dealing with chronic illness may be appropriate in some cases. In other instances, referral for legal, financial, or occupational counseling is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular exercise promotes a feeling of physical and mental well-being; it is especially valuable due to the chronic nature of PD and its associated progressive motor limitations. Exercise may not slow the progression of akinesia, rigidity, or gait disturbance, but it can alleviate some secondary orthopedic effects of rigidity and flexed posture such as shoulder, hip, and back pain, and it may also improve function in some motor tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Mounting evidence suggests that regular aerobic exercise has a positive impact on PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. In addition, a randomized controlled trial of 195 subjects with mild to moderate PD found that a six-month program of twice-weekly tai chi training was superior to resistance training and stretching for improvement in measurements of postural stability, stride length, and functional reach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were fewer of self-reported falls at six months for the tai chi group compared with the resistance training and stretching groups (62 versus 133 versus 186), and the difference was statistically significant for the comparison with the stretching group.</p><p>Thus, exercises to improve balance, flexibility and strength should be emphasized. Brisk walks, tai chi, swimming, and water aerobic exercises may be particularly useful, though available studies comparing the effectiveness of different interventions are not definitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other modalities that may improve functional outcome for patients with PD include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidisciplinary rehabilitation with standard physical and occupational therapy components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treadmill training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance training and high-intensity resistance training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cued exercises with visual (mirror), auditory (metronome), and tactile feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active music therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p/><p>A 2013 systematic review observed that most of the benefits with physical therapy for patients with PD were small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, many patients gain lasting confidence and a sense of control over one aspect of the disease, especially if they have never engaged in physical activity in the past. Referral to a physical therapist or exercise group is a good way to get patients started in such activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SPEECH THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysarthria and hypophonia are common manifestations of PD. The practice parameter from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) issued in 2006 concluded that speech therapy for patients with PD may be helpful in improving speech volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This conclusion was based on two small trials that compared speech therapy with no therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. One employed speech therapy emphasizing prosodic features of pitch and volume reinforced with visual feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], while the other employed therapy aimed solely at maximizing phonatory effort and loudness (the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Both of these methods were found to be possibly effective by the AAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A 2012 systematic review evaluated the same trials and concluded that although many of the outcome measures were significantly improved with therapy, the small patient numbers (n = 41), methodologic limitations of the trials, and possible publication bias preclude firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of speech and language therapy for PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elderly patients with chronic illness are at risk for poor nutrition and weight loss. Prompt recognition and management of this problem is important to avoid loss of bone and muscle mass. No specific diet influences the course of PD, although certain recommendations can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high fiber diet and adequate hydration help manage the constipation of PD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large, high-fat meals that slow gastric emptying and interfere with medication absorption should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary protein restriction is not necessary except in some patients with advanced disease and motor fluctuations in whom competition with other amino acids interferes with L-dopa absorption.
