They originate from endodermal elements termed mammary ridges. The mammary ridges extend from the embryonic axilla to the inguinal region, but only the area over the fourth intercostal space develops further, while the rest atrophies. Under the influence of steroid hormones during childhood growth and development, the breast buds enlarge, and glandular elements appear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Adipose tissue and lactiferous ducts (lobes of the mammary gland at the tip of the nipple) grow in response to estrogens, while progesterone stimulation causes lobular growth and alveolar budding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Thelarche typically begins between the ages of 8 and 13 years, with an average age of onset of 10.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. While the breast bud is one of the first signs of puberty, the estimated mean time for full breast development is 4.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Examination of the newborn includes assessment of breast size, nipple position, presence of accessory nipples, and nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Asymmetric breast enlargement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a thin milky nipple discharge (&quot;witch's milk&quot;) related to stimulation from maternal hormones can occur in both males and females.

Performance of a clinical breast examination allows the clinician to reassure the adolescent that her breasts are growing and developing normally, or if this is not the case, to identify abnormalities that the adolescent may have been reluctant to mention.</p><p>Clinical examination of the adolescent breast includes observation for gross abnormalities (eg, asymmetry, dimpling, color changes, etc) while the female is in the upright position. Breast palpation is performed with the patient in the supine position; the arm ipsilateral to the breast that is being examined should be placed over the patient's head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. The breast tissue is examined with the flat finger pads using the vertical strip method, concentric circular method, or in a clockwise fashion like the spokes on a wheel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The sexual maturity rating (also called the Tanner stages) should be noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 1</a>). A complete breast examination includes palpation for axillary, supraclavicular, and infraclavicular lymphadenopathy. In addition, the areola should be compressed to assess for nipple discharge. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Nipple discharge'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast self-awareness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that adolescent patients of all ages be counseled about breast self-awareness (ie, awareness of the normal appearance and feel of their breasts) and to notify their health care provider if they notice a change such as a mass or new onset of redness or nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. We do not encourage adolescents to perform self-breast examination (ie, routine, repeated, systematic inspection and palpation of their breasts).</p><p>Although experts historically have recommended teaching adolescents self-breast examination for the purpose of screening for breast cancer, there is lack of evidence that breast self-examination impacts rates of breast cancer diagnosis, breast cancer death, or tumor stage or size at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Screening for breast cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our promotion of breast self-awareness is consistent with the recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the United States Preventive Services Task Force, who suggest that women be counseled about breast self-awareness and to notify their health care provider if they notice a change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

The terminology for accessory breast tissue depends upon the type of tissue that is present. Polymastia refers to the presence of any accessory breast tissue. Polythelia refers to supernumerary (or accessory) nipples. Although polythelia is present at birth, it may not be recognized until later in life.</p><p>In most cases, accessory breast tissue consists of a small areola and nipple. However, glandular tissue also may be present. Accessory nipples may occur at any point along the milk line from the axilla to the groin where appropriate regression during embryonic development did not occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61921 \">figure 1</a>); the most common site is just inferior to the normal breast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86172\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86172 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most common site for polymastia is the lower axilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Some studies have suggested an association between polythelia and renal anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; renal ultrasonography may be indicated to evaluate this possibility in children with supernumerary nipples, particularly if they have other congenital anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although there are little high quality data to guide the decision, we generally suggest renal ultrasonography for patients with supernumerary nipples after a discussion of the risks and benefits. If a renal anomaly is found, pelvic imaging may be warranted since the genitourinary systems develop together during embryogenesis, and concomitant genital abnormalities may be present.</p><p>Supernumerary nipples usually are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Surgical removal may be indicated if the patient is concerned about his or her appearance. Surgical excision of polymastia also may be warranted to prevent painful swelling during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the rare development of fibroadenoma or tumor in accessory breast tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].

Amastia refers to the absence of breast tissue. This is a rare condition that is thought to occur from obliteration of the milk line during embryogenesis. When bilateral, it is often associated with other congenital anomalies.</p><p>Unilateral amastia is one of the manifestations of Poland syndrome (also called Poland sequence), which consists of unilateral absence or hypoplasia of the pectoralis muscle and a variable degree of ipsilateral hand and digit anomalies, including syndactyly, brachydactyly, and oligodactyly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Underlying conditions that should be considered in girls with small breasts and abnormalities of pubertal development include hypothyroidism, ovarian failure, and androgen excess. Significant hypomastia also can be associated with connective tissue disorders, mitral valve prolapse, or previous radiation to the chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Most mature women have some degree of breast asymmetry. Asymmetry may be more pronounced between Tanner stage 2 and 4, when the breast is developing, but often improves by Tanner stage 5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Despite this improvement, 25 percent of adult women have some degree of breast asymmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Breast asymmetry also may result from unilateral limitation of breast growth related to injury of the prepubertal breast (eg, trauma, infection, surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, the appearance of breast asymmetry may be caused by an abnormality of the rib cage or scoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>After performing a complete breast examination to exclude mass, cyst, or abscess in the larger breast, the size of each breast should be measured and recorded annually through middle adolescence. Each breast is measured with a tape measure in the horizontal and vertical dimensions; nipple measurements also should be recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The early adolescent patient with breast asymmetry should be reassured that her breasts are still growing and that the final degree of asymmetry cannot be determined until the breasts have fully developed, which occurs around 18 years of age. Adolescents who are self-conscious about the asymmetry should be encouraged to wear a padded brassiere or a brassiere that is padded on the smaller side (often available from stores that service mastectomy patients) to help mask the asymmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A major difference in size can be treated with a prosthetic insert (also available from stores that service mastectomy patients).</p><p>If annual serial measurements of the breast demonstrate no further growth, and the patient is unhappy about the discrepancy in breast size, a referral to a breast or plastic surgeon for augmentation of the smaller breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduction of the larger breast may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Breast augmentation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Breast reduction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tuberous breast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberous breast is a variant of breast development in which the base of the breast is limited and the nipple and areola are overdeveloped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86171\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86171 \">picture 4</a>). The etiology is unknown. If the breast examination is otherwise normal, the patient may be referred for cosmetic surgery. The available surgical options vary depending on the location of the hypoplastic breast tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast atrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophy of breast tissue commonly occurs secondary to weight loss from chronic diseases or eating disorders. Breast size may be restored with weight gain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Juvenile breast hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Juvenile breast hypertrophy (also called virginal breast hypertrophy and macromastia) refers to spontaneous overgrowth of breast tissue. It is extremely uncommon. The etiology is unclear but may be related to an abnormal response to gonadal hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The overgrowth may be unilateral or symmetric (more common) and begins around menarche. In adolescents with juvenile breast hypertrophy, each breast may weigh several pounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86170\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86170 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Patients often complain of receiving negative attention from others as well as having back pain and limited physical activity. During phases of rapid growth, skin changes, such as peau d'orange or necrosis, may occur. Resolution is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis for juvenile breast hypertrophy includes juvenile fibroadenoma, non-breast cancers, and phyllodes tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24,27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast masses in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment is based upon the stage of the patient's growth. A proper fitting, supportive brassiere may provide some relief from back pain. Progesterone or antiestrogens can be used to control breast growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After achievement of full breast development, surgery should be considered for cosmetic reasons <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic back pain. Patients should be counseled that reduction mammoplasty in the appropriate adolescent with realistic expectations has a high satisfaction rate and that this surgery usually affords the ability to breast-feed in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Breast augmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Teenagers may seek breast augmentation for reconstructive purposes related to congenital defects (eg, amastia, severe breast asymmetry, tuberous breast) or for purely aesthetic reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The American Society of Plastic Surgeons has developed a briefing statement on plastic surgery for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], which the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Adolescent-Health-Care/Breast-and-Labial-Surgery-in-Adolescents&amp;token=VSVNKgP4khLoY7h+TKtBJ6jmcbMz1h9y8uELIXshVqkZXp0tMhu+VbAOwubS8XdrW/pxNxuNT9C2umh/G5M2YpixLMLG9k3mk1rMekKBMLiQnyg7td1QlQsV3D8gfuZaxKiTmz28cwDKx7vLwwU3t2Wu/BGN4NVYqwHG84ECuLo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=102\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> summarizes in its committee opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Information from the history can help to identify factors contributing to breast pain so that appropriate management can be undertaken. Important questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pain cyclic, specifically occurring shortly before menstruation? In the absence of other findings, cyclic and poorly localized mastalgia may be considered to be the severe end of the spectrum of physiologic swelling.

Focal tenderness may be suggestive of a tender cyst, rupture through the wall of an ectatic duct, or a particularly tender area of breast nodularity; focal tenderness also may be related to poorly fitting underwire bras; acute enlargement of cysts and periductal masses may cause severe localized pain with sudden onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

A nipple discharge may occur during milk production (lactation) after childbirth, as a result of mechanical stimulation of the nipple by fondling or sucking, or due to irritation from clothing.
