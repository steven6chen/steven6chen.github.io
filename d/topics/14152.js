Prenatal diagnosis of fetal hemoglobinopathy is offered when the fetus is at risk of being affected. The purpose is to allow parents to make reproductive choices based on this information and, in the case of alpha-thalassemia major, to monitor the pregnancy for nonimmune hydrops fetalis and potentially intervene. The clinical sequelae of other hemoglobinopathies manifest later in life and have no adverse effects on the fetus, mother, or neonate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE FREQUENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sickle cell disease and thalassemia are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide.

Data from state newborn screening programs showed that 1.5 percent of all infants screened in 2010 had sickle cell trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence of sickle cell trait was 73.1 per 1000 African American infants, 6.9 per 1000 Hispanic infants, 3 per 1000 white infants, and 2.2 per 1000 Asian, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander infants screened. Approximately 30 percent of African Americans have alpha thalassemia minor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>In the US, the incidence of sickle cell disease has remained relatively stable (SS disease 1 in 3721 newborns, SC disease 1 in 7386 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]); however, the prevalence of individuals with hemoglobinopathy, particularly thalassemia, is changing because of the immigration of new ethnic groups, some of whom are carriers of hemoglobinopathies that had been rare in the United States, and the increasing number of pregnancies among couples with different ethnicities in this country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. This has led to births of infants with hemoglobinopathies that previously had not been seen and from diverse ethnicities.</p><p>These points are illustrated by data from the California newborn universal mandatory screening program for hemoglobinopathies that was initiated in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Each year, about 0.05 percent of the 530,000 newborn samples are sent to the Hemoglobin Reference Laboratory for confirmatory testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 1998 and 2006, sickle cell disease was the most common hemoglobinopathy (1 in 6600 births) followed by alpha-thalassemia (1 in 9000 births) and beta-thalassemia disease (1 in 55,000 births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The confirmatory analysis modified the initial screening in 5 percent of cases and revealed 25 rare or new genotypes.

In addition, hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">E/beta</span> thalassemia, a &quot;new&quot; hemoglobinopathy condition in California, was found almost exclusively in Southeast Asians with a prevalence of 1 in every 2600 births.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Global data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Globally, about 7 percent of pregnant women are gene carriers of beta or alpha zero thalassemia, or hemoglobin S, C, D Punjab, or E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of hemoglobinopathy varies worldwide and may be underreported in resource-limited countries where technologically sophisticated diagnostic laboratory tests are not available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Thalassemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thalassemias are the most common inherited single-gene disorder in the world and occur most frequently in malaria-endemic areas including the Mediterranean area, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. Extensive screening programs and prenatal diagnosis have resulted in a consistent decline in the birth of infants with beta-thalassemia in Mediterranean at-risk populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, thalassemia remains a clinical problem in other parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=public-health-issues-in-the-thalassemic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Public health issues in the thalassemic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Variations in the genotype of the heterozygotes result in differences in thalassemia phenotypes in the affected child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African Americans may be heterozygous for both the beta thalassemia gene and sickle cell gene, since the two genes are closely linked. Alpha thalassemia minor (also called trait) in Africans most commonly consists of one gene for alpha globin synthesis missing on each chromosome 16 (trans). This deletion does not result in fetal sequelae. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, the Southeast Asian pattern of alpha thalassemia minor consists of both genes missing from the same chromosome (cis). If both parents have this pattern, offspring may have all four alpha globin genes absent and will be unable to synthesize any adult hemoglobins or fetal hemoglobin. Tetrameric gamma chains (hemoglobin Bart) in the affected fetus bind oxygen with high affinity, causing severe fetal anemia, which leads to hypoxia, high-output cardiac failure, hydrops fetalis, and death. If one parent has alpha thalassemia minor (cis) and the other is either a silent carrier for alpha thalassemia (one alpha globin gene missing) or has alpha thalassemia minor (trans), this may result in Hemoglobin H disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoglobin S, C, E</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The structural hemoglobin variants S and C are most common in tropical Africa, and also found in Mediterranean countries, Saudi Arabia, and Caribbean countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2010, more than 300,000 infants were born with homozygous SS disease and over five million infants were born with sickle trait worldwide, with the majority of these infants born in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Hemoglobin E is found most commonly in Southeast Asia. It is estimated that 30 million Southeast Asians are carriers for hemoglobin E and one million have homozygous EE disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR PRECONCEPTIONAL HEMOGLOBINOPATHY COUNSELING, PRENATAL SCREENING, AND PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of the prenatal hemoglobinopathy screening is to identify asymptomatic individuals whose offspring are at risk of an inherited hemoglobinopathy. Screening should occur for all individuals. Screen positive couples are offered prenatal diagnosis to determine whether the fetus is affected.</p><p>Because the thalassemias and hemoglobin structural variants are autosomal recessive genetic disorders, parents who are heterozygote carriers of gene mutations that affect the same globin chain have a 25 percent chance of having an offspring with a hemoglobinopathy. The risk of fetal hemoglobinopathy increases to 50 percent if one of the parents is homozygous for the gene mutation and the other parent is a carrier. The availability of prenatal DNA testing provides at-risk couples a definite answer, rather than a statistical estimate, on whether the fetus has a hemoglobinopathy. This information is used by the family to consider their reproductive options. However, prenatal diagnosis also raises ethical dilemmas since the clinical phenotype of the affected infant is difficult to predict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and parental decisions about pregnancy continuation versus termination strongly depend on the gestational age at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In most cases of confirmed fetal hemoglobinopathy, prenatal testing does not alter obstetrical care, as fetal hemoglobinopathy typically has no adverse effects on the fetus, mother, or course of pregnancy. One exception is homozygous alpha thalassemia with the loss of all four alpha globin chains, which usually results in hydrops fetalis and death during the late second through mid-third trimester of pregnancy. Fetal hydrops can be associated with maternal mirror syndrome, which can be life-threatening for the mother (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonimmune hydrops fetalis&quot;, section on 'Mirror syndrome'</a>). The use of intrauterine transfusion for management of homozygous alpha thalassemia has resulted in successful live births, sometimes at full term, although this intervention commits the infant to transfusion dependence. The prenatal diagnosis of this disorder allows the at-risk couple the option of considering intrauterine intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine fetal transfusion of red cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING AT-RISK PARENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H637033259\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Universal screening will detect more hemoglobinopathy carriers than selective screening based on race and ethnicity, given the increasingly diverse ethnic and geographic distribution of hemoglobinopathy genotypes in the United States and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the cost-effectiveness of universal screening in pregnant women has not been established. In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends offering hemoglobinopathy carrier screening with red cell indices to all pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. ACOG recommends a hemoglobin electrophoresis in addition to a complete blood count if there is suspicion of hemoglobinopathy based on ethnicity (African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, or West Indian descent) or if red cell indices show a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) or mean corpuscular volume (MCV).</p><p>Characteristics other than ethnicity that are associated with a higher risk that an individual is a hemoglobinopathy carrier include a history of chronic anemia or stillbirth, a relative with a hemoglobin structural variant or thalassemia, and consanguinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H637033390\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If not performed before pregnancy, hemoglobinopathy screening is most useful when performed early in pregnancy so that prenatal diagnosis, if indicated and desired, can be performed when parents have the option of terminating the pregnancy and are considering termination. In cases of homozygous alpha thalassemia with the loss of all four alpha globin chains, early diagnosis of a continuing pregnancy would prompt changes in pregnancy management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516220321\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing is the cornerstone of prenatal screening for hemoglobinopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100633\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100633 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Screening for thalassemia</strong> &ndash; A complete blood count (CBC) with red blood cell indices is a common initial screening test for thalassemia as it is easy to perform, readily available in countries with limited resources, and also provides baseline <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. An MCV &lt;80 femtoliters (fL) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MCH &lt;27 picogram (pg) with elevation in the red blood cell (RBC) count in the absence of iron deficiency suggests alpha or beta thalassemia minor and further testing with hemoglobin analysis is indicated to establish a diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is important to note that hemoglobin analysis in the setting of combined iron deficiency and beta thalassemia trait can be falsely normal; therefore, iron deficiency should be corrected prior to hemoglobin analysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Microcytic anemia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Maternal hemoglobin analysis can be performed either by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or isoelectric focusing (IEF) to identify abnormal hemoglobins associated with thalassemia (eg, hemoglobin F, hemoglobin A2, hemoglobin H) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116210 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115337 \">table 2</a>). Hemoglobin analysis (either HPLC or IEF) cannot detect alpha thalassemia minor beyond the neonatal period. A MCV &lt;80 fL, normal ferritin and normal hemoglobin profile, particularly in individuals of Southeast Asian or Mediterranean descent, suggests alpha thalassemia minor. DNA-based testing for alpha globin gene deletions is required to establish a diagnosis. Criteria for diagnosis of the thalassemias and differential diagnosis are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Screening for sickle cell trait</strong> &ndash; Prenatal screening for sickle cell trait is performed with HPLC or IEF; hemoglobin electrophoresis is acceptable if these tests are not available. Sickle cell trait (rather than sickle cell disease) is established by finding both hemoglobin A and hemoglobin S, with the amount of hemoglobin A greater than hemoglobin S. These tests will also detect hemoglobin C carriers. Screening and diagnosis of sickle cell disorders are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-trait#H24518757\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle cell trait&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;, section on 'Laboratory methods'</a>.)</p><p/><p>If the results of the maternal hemoglobin analysis demonstrate that the mother is a heterozygote carrier for hemoglobinopathy or homozygous, then paternal evaluation is needed to assess fetal risk. Maternal conditions requiring partner testing include clinically significant maternal hemoglobinopathies (eg, SS, SC, hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">S/beta</span> thalassemia), as well as carrier states (hemoglobin AS, AC, AD-Punjab, AO-Arab, A Lepore, alpha or beta thalassemia minor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Prior to testing, paternity should be discussed, including the possibility that the putative father may not be the biologic father. The rare possibility of postfertilization mutations, such as uniparental disomy, should also be discussed. </p><p>Paternal testing includes CBC and hemoglobin analysis. As indicated above, a MCV &lt;80 fL in the absence of iron deficiency suggests thalassemia minor. If there are time constraints, initiation of the paternal evaluation with a CBC (including a MCV) and hemoglobin analysis can be done simultaneously with the maternal evaluation of hemoglobinopathy. </p><p>If the biologic father is unavailable for testing, fetal diagnostic testing can be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516221447\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516221728\"><span class=\"h2\">During pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal diagnostic testing should be offered to pregnant couples at risk of having a fetus with hemoglobinopathy and who understand the risks, limitations, and benefits of testing. After counseling, the at-risk couple should be able to make an informed decision on whether to proceed with genetic testing and should have an understanding of how the results of genetic testing will impact their reproductive choices. The use of prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobin structural variants and thalassemia is influenced by the ethical, cultural, and social background of the family. It is estimated that 50 to 70 percent of parents with sickle cell trait or thalassemia minor who have received genetic counseling request prenatal testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

These procedures are discussed in detail separately.

Fetal cell-free DNA can be detected in the maternal circulation as early as four weeks of gestation, with levels increasing with advancing gestational age. Much of the research efforts have been directed towards detecting paternal point mutations in free DNA sequences in maternal plasma or serum. Obtaining highly purified fetal DNA from maternal blood is difficult because of the small amount of fetal DNA in maternal blood and the high background of maternal DNA contamination. In the case of hemoglobinopathies, initial efforts focused on the detection of the paternal allele in maternal circulation, which is limited to couples with different mutations. If the paternal allele is not detected, this would exclude the risk of an affected fetus; however, if the paternal allele was detected, it would not be possible to distinguish between fetal carrier status and disease without invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Additional research is ongoing to improve noninvasive detection methods in couples with the same mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Gene frequency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The purpose of preconceptional counseling and prenatal hemoglobinopathy screening is to identify couples whose future offspring or current pregnancy is at high risk of an inherited hemoglobinopathy. All pregnant women should be screened. After identification of couples at risk for having an offspring with an inherited hemoglobinopathy, prenatal diagnosis is offered to determine whether the fetus is affected. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for preconceptional hemoglobinopathy counseling, prenatal screening, and prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The purpose of prenatal diagnosis is to allow parents to make reproductive choices based on this information and, in the case of alpha-thalassemia major, to monitor the pregnancy for nonimmune hydrops fetalis and potentially intervene. The clinical sequelae of other hemoglobinopathies manifest later in life and have no adverse effects on the fetus, mother, or neonate. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for preconceptional hemoglobinopathy counseling, prenatal screening, and prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If prenatal screening by history or laboratory findings suggests an increased risk of hemoglobinopathy, hemoglobin analysis is indicated to establish a diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100633\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100633 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Identifying at-risk parents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA-based testing for fetal hemoglobinopathies can be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy on cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling (typically performed at 10 to 12 weeks of gestation) or on cultured amniotic fluid cells obtained by amniocentesis (typically performed after 15 weeks of gestation), if the couple desires. (See <a href=\"#H516221447\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If prenatal diagnosis results in diagnosis of fetal hemoglobinopathy, parents should be thoroughly counseled by a hematologist or expert in the management of hemoglobinopathies about the natural history of the specific disorder, how it may affect their child, and treatment approaches, as well as their reproductive options. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4356614\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dr. Brigitta U Mueller, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Modell B, Darlison M.
