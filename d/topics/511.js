They are usually placed bronchoscopically and can be used to treat a variety of large airway diseases. The indications for airway stenting, types of stents, insertion technique, and potential complications are reviewed here. Other strategies for managing central airway obstruction are discussed separately.

Thus, contraindications to bronchoscopy, general anesthesia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> procedural sedation are also considered contraindications to airway stenting. These are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of anesthesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Contraindications and precautions'</a>.)</p><p>Airway stenting is also contraindicated prior to laser therapy, endobronchial electrocautery, or argon plasma coagulation because such therapies can burn or break airway stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In contrast, external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy are NOT contraindications to airway stenting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21536560\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF STENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stents are made from several different materials and are available in varying sizes and shapes. The main classes of stents are silicone stents, metal stents, and hybrid stents. The advantages and disadvantages of each are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58596%7EPULM%2F54642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58596 graphicRef54642 \">table 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Silicone stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Silicone stents are the type of stents that are used most commonly to manage central airway obstruction. They have several desirable qualities: they are firm, stable in high temperatures, and able to repel water. In addition, they are relatively inexpensive, well tolerated, do not break down, and resist extrinsic compression from tumor, enlarged lymph nodes, and circumferential fibrotic scars. However, silicone stents also have an undesirable quality: they tend to migrate more commonly than other types of airway stents and may require repeated bronchoscopic procedures for stent repositioning. </p><p>Deployment of a silicone stent usually requires rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia, although insertion via flexible bronchoscopy has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Multiple stents can be inserted if the airway obstruction is long. Once a stent has been deployed, it can be repositioned or removed using rigid grasping forceps.</p><p>Silicone stents of various lengths, shapes, and diameters are available. It is advisable to have a large stock available so that the most appropriate one for each individual patient may be chosen. Custom made airway stents can be ordered from several manufacturers. In our clinical practice, we have airway stents custom made more often if the indication is a benign, complex airway stricture from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis), tuberculosis, or tracheobronchomalacia, than if the indication is airway narrowing due to tracheobronchial malignancy because such patients generally live with an indwelling airway stent for a more prolonged duration. </p><p>There are several types of silicone airway stents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smooth-walled Hood stent</strong> &ndash; The smooth-walled Hood stent (from the Hood Manufacturing Company) was one of the first silicone airway stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is a straight, smooth-walled silicone tube that can be ordered in varying lengths and diameters, or in the shape of a Y (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58973\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58973 \">picture 1</a>). Newer versions of the smooth-walled Hood stent have a small flange on its proximal and distal aspects to prevent the stent from being easily displaced within the airway by coughing. Despite this modification, stent migration still occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Studded Dumon stent</strong> &ndash; The studded Dumon stent (from Novatech) has become the most widely used airway stent in the world (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68066\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68066 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is manufactured in several different shapes, including straight, L-shaped, and Y-shaped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The stent has small studs on its external surface to help prevent migration. These studs embed themselves slightly within the airway wall mucosa, but do not cause permanent damage. Larger diameter stents can be specially made and stent loading devices exist that assist with loading large Y-stents into the stent introducer tubes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Studded Hood stent</strong> &ndash; The studded Hood stent (from the Hood Manufacturing Company) contains studs in a similar configuration as the studded Dumon stent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66659\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66659 \">picture 3</a>). Its performance and characteristics appear to be equivalent to those of the studded Dumon stent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reynders-Noppen tygon stent</strong> &ndash; The Reynders-Noppen tygon stent (from Reynders Medical Supply) is a cylindrical tygon plastic tube that has been molded into a screw-thread shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64690\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64690 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is more rigid than the other silicone stents; thus, it must be pushed into position along the outside of a specific introducer because it cannot be folded into an applicator for bronchoscopic insertion. The Reynders-Noppen is available in Europe and Asia, but not in the United States.</p><p/><p>The different stents have seldom been compared to one another. One study compared 50 patients with tracheal stenosis who were treated with either the studded Dumon stent or the Reynders-Noppen Tygon stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Stent migration occurred more often in more patients who received studded Dumon stents than in patients who received Reynders-Noppen stents (24 versus 5 percent), although the difference was not statistically significant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Metal stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metal airway stents have several advantages over silicone stents: they are usually inserted via flexible bronchoscopy, which requires only topical airway anesthesia and procedural sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; metal stents rarely migrate within the tracheobronchial tree; and, self-expanding metal stents may generate sufficient force to distend even the firmest of strictures, which is helpful if the airway cannot be dilated before stent insertion. </p><p>Metal airway stents also have disadvantages compared to silicone stents: there is greater risk of airway perforation due to their expansile force, which makes the proper selection of stent size (particularly maximal dilated diameter) essential; they are more difficult, if not impossible, to remove or reposition following deployment; granulation tissue or tumor easily grows through the spaces between the uncovered metal struts, which may lead to obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]; and, metal stents are more expensive. Complications related to metal stents have prompted a black box warning from the United States Food and Drug Administration and most operators avoid their use in patients with benign strictures. When absolutely necessary, most operators will only use covered metal airway stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>There are several types of metal airway stents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wallstent (also called the Schneider stent)</strong> &ndash; The Wallstent (from Schneider International, Ltd), is a self-expanding airway tubular mesh of cobalt-alloy braided filaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82035\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82035 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It is loaded into a delivery catheter and then expands and shortens upon deployment. A variety of lengths and diameters are available. Despite being an attractive option to clinicians who do not perform rigid bronchoscopy, the Wallstent is seldom used because recurrent obstruction due to the growth of tumor or granulation tissue through the spaces between the mesh is common. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultraflex stent</strong> &ndash; The Ultraflex airway stent (from Boston Scientific Corporation) consists of a single layer of braided, knitted flexible nitinol (nickel-titanium alloy) wire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. It is deployed by gradually removing a suture that holds the stent in a compressed state. Ultraflex stents are available with or without an outer silicone covering, although the covered stent is used more often because the uncovered stent is susceptible to ingrowth by tumor or granulation tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cook-Gianturco stent</strong> &ndash; The Cook-Gianturco stent (from Cook Instruments) is a continuous loop of stainless steel wire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76360\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76360 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. It is compressed into a narrow cylinder, which expands immediately following bronchoscopic deployment. The stent comes in varying diameters, as well as in single and double post-expansion lengths. Multiple stents can be attached to one another to bridge long lesions. The Cook-Gianturco stent maintains an expansive force once deployed and small hooks embed in the airway mucosa to retard migration. While these devices are well designed to resist migration, airway wall damage may occur after prolonged deployment and the growth of tumor or granulation tissue through the spaces between the stainless-steel wires can impair airway patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The Cook-Gianturco stent is used in Asia and Europe, but it is no longer available in the United States. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hybrid stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several airway stents that incorporate two or more different materials. Such hybrid airway stents were designed to remedy the drawbacks of silicone stents and metal stents described above. As an example, a hybrid airway stent may consist of expandable metal struts (resist compression) covered by a silicone membrane (limits the ingrowth of tumor or granulation tissue) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Hybrid stents tend to be more expensive than airway stents that are made exclusively of one material.</p><p>There are several types of hybrid stents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Covered Wallstent</strong> &ndash; The covered Wallstent is similar to the Schneider stent that was described above, except the covered Wallstent is partially covered by a thin silicone membrane. The purpose of the membrane is to prevent the extension of tumor or granulation tissue between the thin wire struts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70395\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70395 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The covered Wallstent is available in multiple lengths and diameters, fits into a catheter for bronchoscopic insertion, is self-expanding following deployment, and maintains its expansile force. However, it is difficult to reposition or remove. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dynamic Y stent </strong>&ndash; Formerly called the R&uuml;sch Y-stent, the Dynamic Y stent (from Boston Scientific Corporation) is a silicone Y-shaped airway stent that has a firm anterior wall made of horseshoe-shaped metal struts and a posterior wall made of soft silicone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68617\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68617 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The firm anterior and soft posterior walls simulate the trachea. The Dynamic Y stent comes in three different diameters and is quite long. Its length makes it an appropriate choice for patients with significant tracheobronchomalacia or long strictures involving the trachea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mainstem bronchi. However, its length also makes it difficult for patients to effectively clear airway secretions and obstruction can occur. The Dynamic Y stent is a difficult stent to insert (specially designed forceps deploy the stent during rigid laryngoscopy) or remove. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polyflex stent</strong> &ndash; The Polyflex stent (from Boston Scientific Corporation) is a self-expanding plastic airway stent that consists of polyester mesh covered with silicone. Some are studded. The Polyflex stent is removable and causes less trauma to surrounding tissues than metal stents, which may lessen tissue hyperplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the development of a fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, migration of the stent is common. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aero stent </strong>&ndash; Formerly called the Alveolus stent, the Aero stent (from Merit Endotek) is a hybrid stent that consists of a covered piece of nitinol that may comply with irregular airway anatomy better than other stents. It is inserted using a specially designed deployment device and an airway measuring device, during either rigid bronchoscopy or flexible bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic guidance. The cost of the Aero stent is high compared to silicone airway stents and has a high migration rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96395\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96395 \">picture 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hanarostent</strong> &ndash; This hybrid stent is made in Korea and is used primarily in gastrointestinal and esophageal disorders. Made of nitinol and silicone, it has a silk thread attached to the proximal edge of the stent to assist with deployment and retrieval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96388\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96388 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leufen stent</strong> &ndash; Leufen Medical (Novotech) has introduced a self-expanding stent for the bronchus and the carina that is fully covered in silicone and has atraumatic extremities. This stent also comes in its own prepackaged delivery system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96394\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96394 \">picture 11</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3697710674\"><span class=\"h2\">Biodegradable stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biodegradable stents temporarily maintain the airway and remain investigational. Biodegradable stents are constructed from a knitted polymer fiber (Polydioxanone) that degrades when placed inside the airway, making ultimate bronchoscopic extraction unnecessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115834 \">picture 12</a>). Indications might include airway strictures secondary to lung transplant-related anastomotic complications, healing fistulas, or otherwise potentially temporary benign strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another indication is pediatric patients with tracheobronchomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], although in at least one study of biodegradable stents in infants, stent fragmentation reportedly caused life-threatening complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21536308\"><span class=\"h1\">INSERTION TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An airway lesion that requires stenting is generally detected by diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy. Indications, contraindications, and flexible bronchoscopic techniques are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whenever a lesion amenable to stenting is identified, the distance from the vocal cords to the lesion, the length of the lesion, and the diameter of the lesion should be measured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62908\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef62908 \">movie 1</a>). Once this is complete, the optimal airway stent (type and size) can be selected and insertion planned. The choice of an airway stent is usually based upon operator preference. Considerations include cost, availability, and experience. Insertion of the airway stent may be part of a bronchoscopic intervention (eg, dilatation, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, or laser resection) or may be done days or weeks later as a palliative measure if the lesion recurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60271\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef60271 \">movie 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These approaches are equally acceptable and depend upon the clinical circumstances and the patient's preferences. </p><p>If a stenotic lesion cannot be resected, dilation should be performed prior to stenting. This allows the stent of greatest diameter to be inserted. If the rigidity of a lesion makes dilation unsafe or impractical, sequential stents of increasing size can be inserted instead. This is best accomplished with silicone stents because they are easily removed and replaced. A self-expanding metal stent is a reasonable alternative that may restore airway patency; however, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning regarding use of metal airway stents in patients with benign airway disorders due to reports of metallic airway stent complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/38,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,43,44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-balloon-dilation-for-benign-airway-strictures-bronchoplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy balloon dilation for benign airway strictures (bronchoplasty)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, identification of the critically narrowed airway segment (ie, the &quot;choke point&quot;) is difficult during bronchoscopy. Sequential multimodality assessment with spirometry, ultrathin bronchoscopy, and endobronchial ultrasound can be used to guide placement of an airway stent over the choke point, but this approach is technically difficult and experimental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, the choke point may migrate following stent placement, requiring revision or placement of a second stent.</p><p>Considering the number of hybrid and self-expandable stents available, interventional radiologists as well as pulmonologists and chest surgeons are inserting stents using radiographic guidance. A retrospective study of carinal and pericarinal stent insertion reported improvement in clinical symptoms in more than 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, it was followed by a 30 percent incidence of stent-related complications. Stents were inserted using fluoroscopic guidance and were inserted over a guidewire placed into the airway during flexible bronchoscopy performed by a pulmonologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856793\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any patient with an airway stent who develops new respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea) should undergo bronchoscopy to determine whether the airway is patent and the stent is in the correct position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75119 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The role of surveillance bronchoscopy two to three months after stent placement is controversial because its yield in detecting major stent-related complications in asymptomatic individuals appears to be small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In our practice, we have a low threshold to perform bronchoscopy, but we do not perform routine surveillance bronchoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21536315\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most airway stents are well tolerated. The following complications can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>], but serious life-threatening complications are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A local inflammatory reaction can be provoked, resulting in the growth of granulation tissue at the proximal and distal ends of the stent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75967 \">picture 13</a>).

The most common complication was re-obstruction (46 percent), followed by post-procedure respiratory failure (33 percent), a mucosal tear (16 percent), and tension pneumothorax (2 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856714\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway stents mitigate or prevent external compression and airway narrowing. By widening a stenotic airway, the symptoms and signs of central airway obstruction (eg, dyspnea, cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory insufficiency) decrease or resolve immediately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/1,2,54-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,54-59</a>], while lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-64</a>], exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], and quality of life improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/1,2,54-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,54-59</a>]. Airway stents may also impede the extension of tumor into the airway lumen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway stents, also known as tracheobronchial prostheses, are tube-shaped devices that are inserted into an airway and used to treat a variety of large airway diseases. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many indications for airway stenting, including malignant tracheobronchial obstruction, postintubation subglottic stenosis, benign tracheal or bronchial stenosis, localized severe expiratory central airway collapse, anastomotic stricture or dehiscence following lung or heart-lung transplantation, and tracheal- or bronchial-esophageal fistula. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to bronchoscopy, general anesthesia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> procedural sedation are also considered contraindications to airway stenting. In addition, airway stenting is contraindicated prior to laser therapy, endobronchial electrocautery, or argon plasma coagulation because such therapies can burn or break airway stents. (See <a href=\"#H21535741\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stents are made from several different materials and are available in varying sizes and shapes. The main classes of stents are silicone stents, metal stents, and hybrid stents. The advantages and disadvantages of each are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58596%7EPULM%2F54642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58596 graphicRef54642 \">table 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21536560\" class=\"local\">'Types of stents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of an airway stent is usually based upon operator preference. Airway stents are often inserted as part of a bronchoscopic intervention, such as dilatation, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, or laser resection. However, they may be placed days or weeks later as a palliative measure if the lesion recurs. (See <a href=\"#H21536308\" class=\"local\">'Insertion technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient with an airway stent who develops new respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea) should undergo bronchoscopy to determine whether the airway is patent and the stent is in the correct position. However, for patients without respiratory symptoms, we suggest NOT performing routine surveillance bronchoscopy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H856793\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious life-threatening complications due to airway stents are rare. Occasional complications include a local inflammatory reaction, obstruction of the stent by secretions or recurrent tumor growth, migration of the stent, airway perforation, or stent rupture. (See <a href=\"#H21536315\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By widening a stenotic airway, airway stents decrease or eliminate the symptoms and signs of central airway obstruction (eg, dyspnea, cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory insufficiency), while improving lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H856714\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/airway-stents/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bolliger CT, Mathur PN, Beamis JF, et al.
