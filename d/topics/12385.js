Children are particularly susceptible to learning fear from their parents. Most childhood fears are normal, temporary, and eventually outgrown. Some fears, however, may be symptoms of an anxiety disorder. Studies show that anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in <span class=\"nowrap\">childhood/adolescence</span>. </p><p>Fears and anxiety are on a continuum, with phobias at the more severe end of the spectrum where symptoms are accompanied by functional impairment. Children with this presentation warrant additional evaluation for specific phobia or other anxiety disorders.</p><p>This topic describes the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, course, differential diagnosis, and initial management of fears in children and adolescents. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in children are discussed separately. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children are also discussed separately.

A number of factors may be at play, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic predisposition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temperamental tendencies (eg, the tendency to react with distress and withdrawal when confronted with unfamiliar people or situations)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct conditioning through traumatic or frightening experiences (eg, a dog bite)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vicarious conditioning through observation of phobic reaction in others</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative information transmission (eg, through reading, hearing about, or seeing frightening events in person or in the media)</p><p/><p>The final three factors are known as Rachman's pathways to fear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, some individuals have fears that are not associated with one of these pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. One explanation for the existence of these nonassociative fears is that they pertain to stimuli that threatened the survival of human ancestors and, therefore, reflect innate, spontaneous reactions to evolutionary cues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The objects of the child's fear change with the sophistication of his or her cognitive development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The primitive reflexes reflect two basic fears present at birth (some argue that &quot;fear&quot; may not be the most appropriate term): fear of falling (loss of support) and fear of loud noises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Subsequent fears reflect the child's increasing awareness of his or her world, the development of imagination (eg, fear of monsters and ghosts), and, finally, the ability to differentiate internal representations from objective reality (eg, realistic fears involving bodily injury) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54750\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54750 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>]. Fear is intensified and expanded by exposure to danger in the real world. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Familial factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Common fears change over the course of development. In one study, self-reported fears were obtained at ages 13 to 14, 16 to 17, and 19 to 20 from 2404 twins and a multivariate longitudinal twin analysis was conducted. Eighteen individual items formed four fear factors: animal, blood-injury, situational, and social. Genetic and environmental risk factors for individual fears are partly mediated through a common fear factor and are partly fear-specific in their effect. In this group, the developmental pattern of these risk factors is complex and dynamic with new common and specific genetic effects arising in late adolescence and early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Fantasy can have a significant role in children&rsquo;s development and resolution of common fears such as nighttime fears. Fantasy-reality differentiation is a developmental process that occurs in the first decade, and sometimes longer, that can impact children&rsquo;s development of fear. In a study aimed at exploring the links between nighttime fears and fantasy-reality differentiation in preschool children, researchers found that children with nighttime fears demonstrated more fantasy-reality confusion compared with their controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These differences in fantasy-reality differentiation were more pronounced in younger children. Additional significant associations were found between fantasy-reality differentiation and age and specific characteristics of the stimuli. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diathesis-stress model asserts that if the combination of the predisposition and the stress exceeds a threshold, the person will develop a disorder. The diathesis-stress model serves to explore how nonbiological or genetic traits (diatheses) interact with environmental influences (stressors) to produce disorders, eg, as fear can lead to the development of a specific phobia.</p><p>Observation of the behavior of other family members in response to certain stimuli or situations also may influence the development of fears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20-22</a>]. A predisposition to fearfulness can be reinforced by parents' or grandparents' fearful behavior and validation that certain things (eg, dogs, thunderstorms) are dangerous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23</a>]. On the other hand, family members who do not share the child's fears are likely to provide reassurance and help the child to overcome his or her fear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a 2016 study that examined the role of vicarious learning in fear development, positive modeling was found likely to be a particularly effective method for preventing fear-related observational learning in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Support strategies'</a> below.)</p><p>A recent metaanalysis reviewed twin studies describing the genetic basis of specific phobias and their corresponding fears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The analysis included five twin studies on fears and ten twin studies on specific phobias. They found fears and phobias to be moderately heritable. The highest mean heritability (&plusmn;standard error of mean [SEM]) among fear subtypes was found for animal fear (45&plusmn;0.004), and among specific phobias for the blood-injury-injection phobia (33%&plusmn;0.06). </p><p>The potential link between parental psychopathology and childhood fears has been explored in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 318 children of parents with lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, MDD plus an anxiety disorder or neither, specific fears were significantly elevated in offspring of parents with MDD plus an anxiety disorder relative to the other groups. Elevated rates of specific fears in offspring of parents with MDD plus an anxiety disorder may be a function of more severe parental psychopathology, increased genetic loading, or unmeasured environmental influences. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large longitudinal study of twins that followed three distinct fear factors &ndash; situational, animal, and <span class=\"nowrap\">blood/injury</span> &ndash; found that fears change over time, and that genetic effects on fear were developmentally dynamic from middle childhood to young adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As the children aged, familial-environmental influences on fears declined in importance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 60 children aged 6 to 10 years showed that children can learn and unlearn fear-related cognitions from mothers and adult strangers. The study compared children's fear beliefs and avoidance preferences for animals following positive or fearful modeling by mothers and strangers in vicarious learning and unlearning procedures. The children were exposed to pictures of novel animals either alone (control) or together with pictures of their mother or a stranger expressing fear or happiness. Fear beliefs and avoidance preferences decreased following positive counterconditioning and increased following fear counterconditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630284766\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contemporary theories of fears and phobias suggest two kinds of etiologic factors; those common to all fears (factors influencing fear-proneness) and factors specific to particular fears (eg, specific learning experiences) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, a young child may become fearful of dogs after a startling experience with a large dog. The (perhaps) innate human fear of large animals is intensified because the child's cognitive level does not permit an explanation of the event that is nonthreatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854759916\"><span class=\"h2\">Link to PTSD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be associated with heightened fear responses and impaired discrimination. Children between 8 and 13 years old participated in a fear conditioning study in addition to providing information about their trauma history and PTSD symptoms. Females showed less discrimination between danger and safety signals during conditioning compared with age-matched males. In boys, intrusive symptoms were predictive of fear responses, even after controlling for trauma exposure. However, in girls, conditioned fear to the danger cue was predictive of self-blame and fear of repeated trauma. This study suggests there are early sex differences in the patterns of fear conditioning and that these sex differences may translate to differential risk for trauma-related psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fears and anxiety are on a continuum in children, with phobias being at the more severe end of the spectrum where the symptoms are accompanied by impairment in daily functioning. Fears and phobias are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear &ndash; Fear is an unpleasant emotion with cognitive, behavioral, and physiologic components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It occurs in response to a consciously recognized source of danger, either real or imaginary. Fear can be normal in children or can cause impairment that brings the child to clinical attention. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phobia &ndash; A phobia is a persistent and compulsive dread of and preoccupation with the feared object or situation. The child may realize that the dread is out of proportion to the danger, but remains unable to feel reassured. To be defined as a phobia, the fear must cause significant impairment in the child&rsquo;s daily activities, including avoidance of the feared object or situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3,15,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,15,30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Childhood fears and phobias present in a variety of ways. Physiologic symptoms of fear include tachycardia, shaking, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or lightheadedness. Young children may cry, have a tantrum, or cling to their parent or caregiver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31,32</a>].</p><p/><p>Older children develop somatic complaints or try to avoid the fear-provoking object or situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,31</a>]. They may not tell their parents about the fear, especially if they suspect that the fear is not warranted. In such cases, it may be the avoidant behavior rather than the fear that brings the child to medical attention (eg, the constipation or encopresis that results from fear and avoidance of toilets, the fatigue that results from fear of the dark) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Children with specific phobias may develop rituals or compulsions (repetitive, purposeful, intentional behaviors) in response to their fears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Mental health care'</a> below.)</p><p>The severity of avoidance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticipatory anxiety often is the major factor in presenting for medical attention, particularly if it interferes with daily activities and social relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31</a>]. Transient fears are seldom brought to the attention of the pediatric health care provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, routinely asking about fears provides an opportunity to determine whether the quantity and intensity of the fears are within the normal realm and to discuss parental responses that can help to relieve or reinforce the child's anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Parental education'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Support strategies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25210984\"><span class=\"h2\">Fears versus phobias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Features that distinguish fears from phobias include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fears do not affect daily activities, play, or development; phobias do.

Children between two and six years were found to have approximately four fears, whereas children between 6 and 12 years had an average of seven. The number of fears peaked in one study, at age 11 years and then decreases with age. Girls report fears more often than boys, possibly because it is more socially acceptable for them to do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,3,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,13,21</a>]. Parents may underreport their child's fears. In one review, mothers underreported their child's fears by up to 40 percent.</p><p>Most fears are transient and resolve with time as a part of typical development. Fears that are not confronted can persist. Normal fear in youth shows a clear developmental pattern that has been described as the &ldquo;ontogenetic parade&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This model suggests that certain fears rise and disappear in a predictable sequence during children&rsquo;s development, as described below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In their preschool years, children are afraid of imaginary creatures (eg, ghosts, witches), animals, and the natural environment (eg, the dark, thunderstorms). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In middle childhood, fears of physical danger, bodily injury, and school performance become more prominent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During adolescence, youths more often report fear about social affairs, death, and illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,35</a>].</p><p/><p>Long-term studies of children with specific phobias are limited; those that exist suggest a positive long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In one series of 10 untreated patients younger than 20 years, symptoms improved in six and resolved in four subjects within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Adults seeking treatment for phobias and other anxiety disorders often report having had similar symptoms during childhood or adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31</a>]. Development of anxiety disorders is thought to be associated with neurobiological changes in areas that are a critical part of the fear neurocircuitry. </p><p>Fear conditioning paradigms can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying the neurobiological development of anxiety. A study among 8- to 13-year-old children with higher and lower trait anxiety examined differential fear conditioning and extinction using skin conductance responses and fear-potentiated startle in 60 children recruited from a low-income urban population. The results indicated that children under 10 years of age show poor discrimination of conditioned stimuli and that anxiety increases fear responses during fear acquisition. After controlling for age and trauma exposure, fear-potentiated startle to the safety cue predicted child anxiety levels, suggesting that impaired safety signal learning may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>As a general rule, the more severe the anxiety disorder and the greater the impairment in functioning, the more likely it is to persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology and course of anxiety disorders in children are discussed separately.

Many of these management strategies can be implemented in pediatric or primary care. </p><p>Parental reassurance, such as a pledge to protect the child as necessary, can be an effective approach for most fears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

One pilot study evaluated a four-week bibliotherapy intervention designed to treat young children with persistent and interfering nighttime fears utilizing a multiple baseline design.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phobia is a persistent and compulsive dread of and preoccupation with the feared object or situation that interferes with the child's ability to function normally. The dread is out of proportion to the danger and results in avoidance of the feared stimulus. Fears and anxiety are on a continuum in children, with phobias being at the more severe end of the spectrum where the symptoms are accompanied by impairment in daily functioning. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood fears present in a variety of ways. Physiologic symptoms of fear include tachycardia, shaking, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or lightheadedness. Young children may cry, have a tantrum, or cling to their parent or caregiver. Older children may develop somatic complaints or try to avoid the fear-provoking object or situation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of the evaluation of a child who presents with symptoms of fear are to differentiate fear from other conditions with similar symptoms and to determine the presence of behaviors that may be reinforcing the fear.
