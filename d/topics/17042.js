While TOF is the most common cyanotic congenital heart lesion, <span class=\"nowrap\">TOF/PA/MAPCAs</span> is considered to be the most extreme form of TOF and accounts for approximately one-fifth of all cases of TOF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetralogy-of-fallot-with-pulmonary-atresia-and-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-arteries-tof-pa-mapcas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99303901\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">TOF/PA</span> is a complex lesion that includes characteristic features of TOF (anterior malaligned ventricular septal defect [VSD] and overriding aorta) with PA. PA may be limited to the valve itself (membranous PA) or involve the subpulmonary infundibulum (muscular PA), and results in no antegrade flow from the right ventricle (RV) to the pulmonary artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs#H258049051\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS)&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary valve atresia'</a>.)</p><p>The lack of antegrade pulmonary blood flow in utero leads to a range of morphologic findings in the pulmonary artery vasculature. If the ductus arteriosus (DA) is present, confluent true pulmonary arteries of variable size may develop. Without flow through the DA, MAPCAs, fetal vessels derived from the splanchnic vascular plexus, may persist after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetralogy-of-fallot-with-pulmonary-atresia-and-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-arteries-tof-pa-mapcas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These vessels connect the systemic and pulmonary arterial vasculature, thereby supplying pulmonary blood flow. MAPCAs are tortuous vessels that arise directly from the aorta or its branches. MAPCAs vary in number and origin, follow circuitous routes to reach central, lobar, and segmental pulmonary arteries, and have variable areas and locations of stenosis. Their arborization pattern is unpredictable and often incomplete, leaving some lung segments with excessive or insufficient flow, and they can become narrow over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetralogy-of-fallot-with-pulmonary-atresia-and-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-arteries-tof-pa-mapcas/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As a result, a given segment of the lung may be supplied solely from the true pulmonary arteries, solely from the MAPCAs, or both. The morphology of the pulmonary vasculature and MAPCAs plays a critical role in determining management decisions.

Some patients may have torrential pulmonary blood flow with high oxygen saturations and, if left unrepaired for a prolonged period of time, are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. In these patients, there is a large volume load to the left ventricle (LV), which may lead to the development of heart failure. In contrast, other patients may have very little pulmonary blood flow and present with cyanosis, which can progress over time.

Management is focused on lowering postrepair RV pressure as much as possible because elevation of the right ventricle to left ventricle <span class=\"nowrap\">(RV/LV)</span> pressure ratio is associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetralogy-of-fallot-with-pulmonary-atresia-and-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-arteries-tof-pa-mapcas/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is therefore of utmost importance to maximize the pulmonary vascular cross-sectional area by recruiting as many lung segments as possible and relieving any significant obstruction to blood delivery from the RV to the pulmonary microvasculature. Establishing antegrade flow as early as possible is also important to facilitate the postnatal growth of the underdeveloped pulmonary arterial tree, thereby allowing access for future interventional procedures.</p><p><ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\"><li>The timing of VSD closure is important, especially related to RVOT reconstruction. Closing the VSD too early may result in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and RV failure. However, delay in closing the VSD after unifocalization may result in excessive pulmonary blood flow causing pulmonary congestion and left-sided heart failure. In our center, the decision to close the VSD is made based on data that predicts postoperative pulmonary artery pressure from an intraoperative flow study and cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetralogy-of-fallot-with-pulmonary-atresia-and-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-arteries-tof-pa-mapcas/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. During the intraoperative flow study, if the mean pulmonary artery pressure stays consistently below 25 mmHg, the VSD can be closed, as it predicts a postoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">RV/LV</span> pressure ratio at or below 0.5, which is associated with a good outcome. However, if it exceeds 25 mmHg, the VSD is not closed and the reconstruction of the RVOT is not performed.</li></ul></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H673199\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our center, our management approach is based on the morphology of individual patients, which can be categorized into the following four groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetralogy-of-fallot-with-pulmonary-atresia-and-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-arteries-tof-pa-mapcas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with <strong>large</strong> caliber MAPCAs <strong>without</strong> significant segmental level stenosis, a <strong>single-stage repair</strong> is generally performed.

In this setting, an initial palliative procedure, an aortopulmonary window (end-to-side anastomosis of the small main pulmonary trunk to the ascending aorta), is performed in the neonatal period that stimulates native pulmonary artery growth. The patient undergoes catheterization three to six months postoperatively to evaluate whether there has been suitable pulmonary artery growth to undergo unifocalization.

Thus, pulmonary blood flow is dependent on systemic-to-pulmonary artery connections through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), bronchial arteries, and MAPCAs, or a combination of these communications. (See <a href=\"#H99303901\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MAPCAs vary in both their distribution and caliber. In some cases, these vessels are restrictive and pulmonary blood flow is low compared with systemic blood flow, resulting in significant cyanosis. In others, the flow can be excessive and pulmonary hypertension (PH) may develop in isolated lung segments. These patients may present with symptoms of heart failure.

In particular, the degree of cyanosis and hypoxemia is dependent on the restriction of blood flow through the systemic-to-pulmonary artery connections. The left-to-right shunt decreases in patients with narrow MAPCAs, resulting in more severe hypoxia and cyanosis. In contrast, unrestricted pulmonary blood flow may lead to pulmonary congestion and heart failure as the infant's pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) decreases.
