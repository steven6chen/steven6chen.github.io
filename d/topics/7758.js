Giardiasis is an important cause of waterborne and foodborne disease, daycare center outbreaks, and illness in international travelers.</p><p>The epidemiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of giardiasis will be reviewed here. The treatment and prevention of giardiasis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>G. duodenalis</em> infection occurs worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. High-risk groups include infants, young children, international adoptees, travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], immunocompromised individuals, and patients with cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Giardiasis is especially common in areas with poor sanitary conditions and limited water-treatment facilities. In resource-limited settings, the prevalence of giardiasis has been reported to be as high as 20 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The highest rates of infection in resource-limited areas occur among children &lt;5 years. Many individuals with <em>G. duodenalis</em> identified in stool samples are asymptomatic, a point highlighted by studies that identified <em>Giardia </em>more commonly in the stool of asymptomatic individuals than among individuals with acute diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Giardiasis is a well-recognized cause of enteric disease among international travelers in the United States, Canada, and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In the United States in 2012, a total of 15,223 cases were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a study including 147 pediatric patients with acute nondysenteric diarrhea in the United States, giardiasis was the cause in 15 percent of cases, second only to rotavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One report in Canada noted an adjusted incidence rate of 25.8 cases per 100,000 population between 1990 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Almost 40 percent of cases occurred in travelers; other important sources of infection included unfiltered water and person-to-person transmission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1626709\"><span class=\"h2\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Giardia </em>species have two morphological forms: cysts and trophozoites. Cysts are the infectious form of the parasite; they are excreted in stool and can survive in moist environments for prolonged periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100761\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100761 \">figure 1</a>). Following cyst ingestion, excystation occurs in the proximal small bowel with release of trophozoites.</p><p>Trophozoites are pear-shaped, binucleate, multi-flagellated parasite forms capable of division by binary fission; they localize principally to the proximal small bowel. An adhesive disk on the ventral surface of the trophozoite facilitates trophozoite attachment to the mucosal surface of the duodenum and jejunum, although the trophozoite does not invade the mucosal epithelium. Trophozoites that do not adhere to the small bowel move forward to the large intestine, where they revert to the infectious cyst form; conjugated bile salts appear to foster encystation. Cysts are passed back into the environment in excreted stool; in the setting of diarrhea, trophozoites can also be found in the stool.</p><p>Following cyst ingestion, infections have an incubation of a week or more before symptoms of acute giardiasis may develop. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Routes of transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of infectious <em>Giardia</em> cysts to humans may occur via three routes: waterborne, foodborne, or fecal-oral transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Water is a major source of giardiasis transmission. <em>Giardia</em> cysts survive readily in mountain streams, as they are hardy in cold water. Water-dwelling mammals, such as beavers, can become infected and may serve as ongoing sources of water contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For these reasons, giardiasis is an important cause of diarrheal illness among hikers in wilderness areas who drink water that has not been adequately filtered, treated, or boiled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Deep well water, in contrast with surface well water, is usually safe because filtration of water through soil removes <em>Giardia</em> cysts. <em>Giardia</em> cysts are resistant to chlorination; therefore, bacterial coliform counts are not a reliable measure of <em>Giardia</em> contamination in chlorinated water sources.</p><p>Foodborne transmission of giardiasis can occur via ingestion of raw or undercooked food (including raw vegetables, salad bars, and fresh fruit) contaminated with cysts and via food that is contaminated after cooking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Person-to-person transmission can occur in settings in which there is fecal incontinence and poor hygiene, such as childcare centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The risk of acquisition and transmission is greatest for young children who are not yet toilet trained; such children can also serve as a source for secondary cases within households [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Giardiasis can be transmitted via heterosexual or homosexual anal-oral sexual contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627168\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Species of the genus <em>Giardia</em> infect many hosts ranging from mammals to amphibians and birds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Six known <em>Giardia </em>species are restricted to nonhuman hosts and are not recognized as causes of human disease. The species <em>Giardia duodenalis</em> consists of eight genetic groups (or assemblages); two assemblages are found in both humans and animals (A and B), and the remaining six are specific to nonhuman hosts, including canines, felines, rodents, and seals (assemblages C to H).</p><p>Genotypes vary even within assemblages A and B, and it is likely that only some genotypic variants have potential to cause infection in humans. Because of this heterogeneity, the role of animals in the epidemiology of human infection remains poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Beavers have been clearly implicated in transmission of waterborne infection to humans, although the roles of domestic dogs and cats as sources of human infection remain to be ascertained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The relative roles of <em>Giardia</em> assemblages and the human host responses that contribute to asymptomatic and symptomatic infections are not fully understood. Experimental ingestion of 10 to 25 cysts has been associated with symptomatic giardiasis in one study; some infections resolved by about three weeks, while others persisted with mild symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a subsequent study, no volunteers challenged with assemblage A <em>Giardia</em> became infected, whereas all challenged with assemblage B strain became infected, although only half of these individuals were symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one study, assemblage B isolates occurred more frequently in patients with chronic infection than assemblage A isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another study, assemblage A was associated with symptomatic infection, and genotype B was associated with asymptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; this association was particularly evident in children &lt;5 years, suggesting host factors also influence the nature of clinical manifestations.</p><p>The pathogenesis of symptoms that can occur in giardiasis (including acute diarrhea and longstanding malabsorption) is not fully understood. The small intestine is the site of the major structural and functional abnormalities associated with giardiasis. Light microscopy may demonstrate no abnormalities, mild or moderate partial villous atrophy, or subtotal villous atrophy in severe cases. An increase in crypt depth may be seen, and microvilli shortening or disruption may occur. Intestinal epithelial tight junctions may be disrupted leading to increased permeability and altered epithelial cell survival. Consequent deficiencies in small bowel epithelial brush border enzymes, including disaccharidases such as lactase, may develop. Such local epithelial enzyme deficiencies likely contribute to symptoms of acute and chronic giardiasis and are slow to recover even with effective treatment of the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627272\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic exposure to <em>G. duodenalis</em> may induce partial immunity; in endemic areas, children &lt;10 years have higher rates of giardiasis than older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, travelers to endemic areas have higher rates of symptomatic disease than long-term residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In endemic regions, however, reinfections can be frequent, so any acquired immunity is limited.</p><p>Humoral immunity appears to be important for host defense against giardiasis. Secretory immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies are an important humoral response to infection, since trophozoites are localized to the intestinal lumen. Patients with cystic fibrosis or immunoglobulin deficiencies (such as common variable immunodeficiency or X-linked agammaglobulinemia) tend to have more severe disease, perhaps because of deficiencies in secretory IgA and cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Patients with HIV infection have impaired immune response to the parasite but do not seem to develop more severe disease; giardiasis is not a major cause of enteritis in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Asymptomatic infections occur in the presence of HIV, although with progressive immunosuppression, the risk of symptomatic infection increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of clinical manifestations associated with giardiasis is variable. In general, about half of exposed individuals clear the infection in the absence of clinical symptoms, approximately 15 percent of individuals shed cysts asymptomatically, and the remaining 35 to 45 percent of individuals have symptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29</a>]. The nature of clinical manifestations in an individual likely depends on a number of factors including the virulence of the isolate, the parasite load, and the host immune response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic infection occurs in both children and adults, and asymptomatic cyst shedding can last six months or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>It has been observed that in resource-limited settings, most children will have encountered <em>Giardia</em> by age two years without it being associated with diarrhea, but infected children may have impaired growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute giardiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of acute giardiasis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; 90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malaise &ndash; 86 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foul-smelling and fatty stools (steatorrhea) &ndash; 75 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal cramps and bloating &ndash; 71 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flatulence &ndash; 75 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea &ndash; 69 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; 66 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting &ndash; 23 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urticaria &ndash; 10 percent</p><p/><p>Symptoms usually develop after an incubation period of 7 to 14 days.

Even in cases of otherwise asymptomatic infection, malabsorption of fats, sugars, carbohydrates, and vitamins may occur. This can lead to hypoalbuminemia and deficiencies of vitamin A, B12, and folate.</p><p>Acquired lactose intolerance occurs in up to 40 percent of patients; clinically, this manifests with exacerbation in intestinal symptoms following ingestion of dairy products. Recovery can take many weeks, even after clearance of the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a small number of patients, persistent infection is associated with development of malabsorption and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Some patients may have persistent infection after initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Chronic giardiasis may resemble other diseases associated with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Travelers who acquire <em>Giardia</em> infections may experience persisting diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Chronic giardiasis may affect growth and development in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,42,43</a>]. A study among Colombian children suggested that giardiasis was a strong predictor of stunted growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A longitudinal study including 597 children in Brazil found that growth was impeded among children with giardiasis, even among those with asymptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Likewise, in Bangladesh, a prospective longitudinal birth cohort study found decreased growth measures among children even without diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Hypersensitivity phenomena such as rash, urticaria, aphthous ulceration, and reactive arthritis or synovitis have been described in the setting of giardiasis, although these manifestations are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,44,45</a>].</p><p>Rarely, <em>Giardia</em> can spread from the duodenum to the biliary and pancreatic ducts, leading to cholecystitis, cholangitis, or granulomatous hepatitis. Impaired exocrine pancreatic function with diminished secretion of trypsin and lipase has also been described.</p><p>Previously infected individuals may report symptoms even years after effective treatment. Following a large waterborne epidemic of giardiasis in Norway, a cohort study including more than 800 individuals exposed to <em>Giardia</em> noted that the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (39 percent) and chronic fatigue (31 percent) were significantly increased six years after exposure (relative to unexposed controls) and the frequency of these symptoms declined with time after the initial exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Another study in the United States noted individuals diagnosed with giardiasis were more likely to have a subsequent diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tools for diagnosis of giardiasis include antigen detection assays, nucleic acid detection assays, and stool examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Available kits include direct immunofluorescent assays (DFA) that use fluorescein-tagged monoclonal antibodies, immunochromatographic assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). In general, these methods have greater sensitivity and faster turn-around time than conventional stool microscopy methods. Specificity and cost are usually relatively comparable. Some studies have shown DFA to have the highest sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Many of the commercially available assays can detect both <em>Giardia</em> and <em>Cryptosporidium</em> simultaneously.</p><p>One study of 325 stool specimens demonstrated that an ELISA against a specific <em>Giardia</em> antigen (antigen 65) detected 30 percent more cases of <em>Giardia</em> than stool microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a study of stool samples from patients with abdominal symptoms using different assays for detection of <em>Giardia</em>, the sensitivities obtained by Ridascreen Giardia, Rida Quick Giardia, Rida Quick Combi, and Giardia-Strip were 82, 80, 80, and 44 percent, respectively.

The diagnosis is usually established based on clinical history; the illness is generally self-limited. Onset of travelers' diarrhea is usually within days, whereas symptomatic giardiasis develops only after a week or more after infection. Evaluation for <em>Giardia</em> is warranted in the setting of delayed onset (at least one week following exposure) of upper gastrointestinal manifestations (such as bloating, gas, or nausea) and in the setting of persistent symptoms.

It has two morphological forms: cysts and trophozoites. Cysts are the infectious form of the parasite; following cyst ingestion, trophozoites are released in the proximal small intestine. Trophozoites that do not adhere to the small intestine move forward to the large intestine where they revert to the infectious cyst form; these cysts are passed back into the environment in excreted stool. (See <a href=\"#H1626709\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>G. duodenalis</em> infection occurs worldwide. High-risk groups include infants, young children, international adoptees, travelers, immunocompromised individuals, and patients with cystic fibrosis. Giardiasis is especially common in areas with poor sanitary conditions and limited water-treatment facilities. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission of infectious <em>Giardia</em> cysts to humans may occur via three routes: waterborne, foodborne, or fecal-oral transmission. Giardiasis is an important cause of diarrheal illness among hikers in wilderness areas who drink water that has not been adequately filtered, treated, or boiled. Transmission of giardiasis can also occur via ingestion of raw or undercooked food contaminated with cysts or via food that is contaminated after cooking. Person-to-person transmission can occur in settings in which there is fecal incontinence and poor hygiene, such as childcare centers. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Routes of transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of clinical manifestations associated with giardiasis is variable. In general, about half of exposed individuals clear the infection in the absence of clinical symptoms, approximately 15 percent of individuals shed cysts asymptomatically, and the remaining 35 to 45 percent of individuals have symptomatic infection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of acute giardiasis include diarrhea, malaise, abdominal cramps, and weight loss. Malabsorption may be responsible for the significant weight loss that can occur in chronic giardiasis. Acquired lactose intolerance occurs in up to 40 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute giardiasis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Chronic giardiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tools for diagnosis of giardiasis include antigen detection assays, nucleic acid detection assays, and stool examination. In areas where available, antigen or nucleic acid detection tests are preferred over stool examination.
