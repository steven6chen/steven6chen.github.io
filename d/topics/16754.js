With the exception of women who have had prior treatment with cyclophosphamide, women with SLE do not appear to have reduced fertility. Women with lupus are at higher risk for pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and premature delivery, and those with antiphospholipid antibodies have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirths. The outcomes for both mother and child are best when SLE has been under good control for at least six months before pregnancy and when kidney disease is in remission.</p><p>This topic review discusses the preparation for and care of SLE during pregnancy. Other topics about lupus are available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has become more successful over the past few decades, making pregnancy a viable option for most women with this disorder. Seven to 33 percent of women whose disease has been in remission for at least six months prior to pregnancy will experience a flare of lupus symptoms during pregnancy. This flare rate is comparable to the flare rate of nonpregnant women. By contrast, more than 60 percent of women with active SLE at the time of conception will have a flare during pregnancy. Women undergoing in vitro fertilization may also have an increased risk of a disease flare during ovulation induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy complications that occur more commonly in women with SLE include high blood pressure, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, emergency cesarean section, excessive bleeding after delivery, or blood clots in the leg or lung. There is a higher incidence of miscarriage and fetal loss, especially in women with coexisting antiphospholipid syndrome. Infants born to women with SLE have a higher risk of being born prematurely and having a low birthweight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Preeclampsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preeclampsia is the medical term for a pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure in the mother after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Another name for preeclampsia is toxemia. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 20 percent of women with SLE. It may occur even more frequently among women with kidney disease, antiphospholipid antibodies, diabetes mellitus, or prior episodes of preeclampsia (66 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The treatment of preeclampsia is for the woman to deliver her infant. Delivery may be delayed for a day or two in some women with preeclampsia who are less than 34 weeks pregnant in order to give treatment with certain steroids that speed fetal lung development. The steroids are given in two doses 24 hours apart. This treatment significantly reduces the infant's risk of lung complications related to prematurity. However, delivery should not be delayed if the mother or infant's life is in danger. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal loss is defined as the death of a fetus after 10 weeks of pregnancy. The risk of fetal loss is increased in women with high blood pressure, active lupus, or lupus nephritis and in those with low complement levels, elevated levels of anti-DNA antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies (including anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulants), or a low platelet count. In one center, approximately 17 percent of women with SLE had a fetal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Women with SLE should be tested for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (eg, lupus anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies). Women with persistent medium or high titers of these antibodies may be at increased risk of fetal loss or other complications. Treatment with low-dose aspirin is often recommended for women with SLE who test positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. However, treatment with heparin is generally reserved for those patients with documented prior pregnancy losses or clotting issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Preterm delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SLE have an increased risk of preterm delivery. Preterm delivery is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of delivering before term is increased in women with more severe SLE, those who require higher doses of glucocorticoids (steroids) during pregnancy, women on certain immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, and women with other pregnancy complications. Careful management of SLE during pregnancy can help to decrease the risk of preterm delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Low birthweight infant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having SLE can increase the risk of a low birthweight baby, especially if the woman requires glucocorticoids; has kidney complications, high blood pressure, antiphospholipid antibodies, or preeclampsia; or experiences premature rupture of membranes (when the water breaks before contractions have begun).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have damaged organs before pregnancy may have a higher risk of pregnancy complications because pregnancy increases the workload on organs throughout the body. This is particularly important in women with kidney disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Lupus nephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with active lupus nephritis at the time of pregnancy have an increased risk of fetal loss (up to 75 percent) and worsening of their kidney function during pregnancy. Women with preexisting high blood pressure, protein in the urine, or high levels of blood urea nitrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> creatinine in their blood are at the highest risk for these complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy after kidney transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with SLE who have received a kidney transplant have a slightly higher risk of miscarriage compared with women without SLE and a kidney transplant, although approximately 77 percent of women go on to deliver a live infant. One-half to two-thirds of these women have a preterm delivery or a low birthweight baby, and there is an increased risk of developing high blood pressure or gestational diabetes during pregnancy or of requiring a cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Lupus and newborns</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal lupus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal lupus is an autoimmune disease that occurs in about 10 percent of babies born to mothers with <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> antibodies. Neonatal lupus is caused by passage of the <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> antibodies from the mother's bloodstream across the placenta to the developing baby after about the 20<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. Many women who give birth to a baby with the neonatal lupus syndrome have <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> antibodies but do not have a diagnosis of lupus or another autoimmune disease at the time of their pregnancy.</p><p>Signs of neonatal lupus include a red, raised rash on the scalp and around the eyes. The rash almost always resolves by six to eight months of age because the antibodies are cleared out of the infant's bloodstream; most (90 percent) of these infants do not develop lupus in later years. Infants can also develop elevations in their liver enzymes that also resolve within a few months of birth.</p><p>The most serious complication of neonatal lupus is complete heart block, which occurs in approximately 2 percent of newborns whose mothers have SSA (Ro) or SSB (La) antibodies. Heart block occurs when there is partial or complete blockage of electrical flow in the fetus's heart, causing an abnormally slow heart rate. Women with SSA (Ro) or SSB (La) antibodies often have regular ultrasound monitoring of the fetus's heart during pregnancy. Ultrasound monitoring of the fetus's heart is generally started at 16 weeks of pregnancy and is continued until the 26<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. The goal is to detect fetal heart block at an early stage so that the fetus can be monitored frequently to assure that the heart is functioning well and to be able to prepare the fetus for a pacemaker if it is needed when born. There is no proven treatment for fetal heart block prior to birth, although some preliminary studies suggest that women with these antibodies who are taking hydroxychloroquine during pregnancy have a lower risk of these complications.</p><p>If a mother gives birth to a baby with neonatal lupus, her risk of having a child with neonatal lupus in a subsequent pregnancy is about 17 percent.

It is uncertain whether learning disabilities are more frequent in children of women with lupus, as they have been found to be more frequent in one research study but not in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE BEFORE PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should discuss their desire to have a child with a rheumatologist and a high-risk obstetrical provider before trying to become pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">General recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These recommendations apply to all women who are considering pregnancy, not just those with SLE.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All women should take a nutritional supplement containing at least 400 mcg of folic acid (the amount in most multivitamins). Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of a specific birth defect called a neural tube defect. Folic acid should be started before trying to conceive and should be continued until at least the end of the first trimester.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women should stop smoking and consuming alcohol or any recreational drugs (eg, marijuana) before trying to become pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a woman takes prescription or nonprescription medications, these should be reviewed with a health care provider who is knowledgeable in the care of pregnant women with lupus, such as an obstetrician, an obstetric nurse practitioner, or a midwife. Some medications are safe during pregnancy, while others are not. In some cases, an alternate medication can be substituted for an unsafe drug. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Medications during pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caffeine intake should be limited to less than 200 mg per day while trying to become pregnant and during pregnancy.

Therefore, women with lupus should be encouraged to continue this medication during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of glucocorticoids along with other immunosuppressive medications, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, may increase the risks of having a small infant or of having preterm premature rupture of membranes (when the water breaks before 37 weeks of pregnancy). In addition, use of glucocorticoids during the first trimester may increase the risk of cleft palate. Despite this, glucocorticoids may need to be continued to manage the disease (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Medications during pregnancy'</a> below). This decision is best made with an experienced rheumatologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstetrical care provider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medications can also cause birth defects and should generally be stopped at least three months before getting pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Medications during pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men who take methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide should stop these medications for at least three months before trying to conceive. This three-month period is necessary to allow for the development of sperm that have not been exposed to these medications. Women who take these medications should wait at least one to three months after stopping these medications before trying to conceive.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Am I ready for pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common for women with long-term medical problems to be worried about how their health will be affected by pregnancy and parenting.</p><p>Women with SLE often have a flare of symptoms during pregnancy or shortly after delivery. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the common discomforts of pregnancy and the symptoms of lupus. Pregnancy discomforts that are similar to those of lupus include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the hands, feet, or ankles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain, especially in the low back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or pain in one or both hands (caused by carpal tunnel syndrome of pregnancy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes (eg, darkening of facial skin)</p><p/><p>It is important to consider the changes that a newborn may bring, including interrupted sleep, fatigue, and, for many women, additional stress. Close communication with an obstetric and rheumatology care provider and support from family and friends can help to ease the challenges of being pregnant and of raising a child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) need regular monitoring of their disease, even if it has been stable, and many women will need treatment of active disease. Care of women with lupus is usually shared during pregnancy between a rheumatologist and a high-risk obstetrician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Care during pregnancy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">The first visit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As soon as pregnancy is detected, most clinicians recommend that women with SLE have a complete physical examination, including measurement of blood pressure and blood testing. The blood tests are important to measure kidney function and to determine if antiphospholipid, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> antibodies are present. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fetal loss'</a> above.)</p><p>Women with SLE with high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies who have had a prior pregnancy loss or preeclampsia may require treatment with an anticoagulant (eg, a low dose of aspirin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heparin) during pregnancy, depending upon their individual situation. This treatment helps to reduce the risk of blood clots and miscarriage.</p><p>To monitor the fetus's growth during pregnancy, it is important to have an accurate date of conception. Women who do not remember the date of their last menstrual period or who are unsure of when the baby was conceived should have an ultrasound examination to determine their due date. A due date that is calculated by ultrasound examination is most accurate when the examination is performed in the first trimester.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">At subsequent visits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with SLE will be seen every two to four weeks until 28 weeks of pregnancy. After 28 weeks, the frequency of visits typically increases. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'After 28 weeks of pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>During the pregnancy, blood and urine testing is recommended to monitor the activity of SLE; the frequency of testing depends upon the individual patient. This usually includes measurement of the kidney function (glomerular filtration rate, urine <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/urine</span> creatinine ratio), testing for antiphospholipid antibodies (if testing previously negative), testing of complement levels (CH50 or C3 and C4), and testing for anti-dsDNA antibodies. After 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, the fetus's heart rate will be measured.</p><p>An ultrasound is usually recommended between 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to ensure that the fetus is growing and developing normally. Regular ultrasounds may be recommended through the remainder of the pregnancy to monitor the fetus's growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">After 28 weeks of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After 28 weeks of pregnancy, most women will be seen every one or two weeks. At these visits, the woman's blood pressure and urine will be monitored. Fetal monitoring may include a biophysical profile and nonstress testing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biophysical profile &ndash; A biophysical profile (BPP) score is calculated to assess the fetus's health. It consists of five components, including nonstress testing and ultrasound measurement of four fetal parameters: fetal body movements, breathing movements, fetal tone (flexion and extension of an arm, leg, or the spine), and measurement of the amniotic fluid levels. Each component is scored individually, with two points given for a normal result and zero points given for an abnormal result. The maximum possible score is 10.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The amniotic fluid level is an important variable in the BPP because a low volume (called oligohydramnios) may increase the risk of umbilical cord compression and may be a sign of changes in the blood flow between the baby and mother. Amniotic fluid levels can become reduced within a short time period, even a few days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonstress testing &ndash; Nonstress testing is done by monitoring the baby's heart rate with a small device that is placed on the mother's abdomen. The device uses sound waves (ultrasound) to measure the baby's heart rate over time, usually for 20 to 30 minutes. Normally, the baby's baseline heart rate should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute and should increase above its baseline by at least 15 beats per minute for 15 seconds when the baby moves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The test is considered reassuring (called &quot;reactive&quot;) if two or more fetal heart rate increases are seen within a 20-minute period. Further testing may be needed if these increases are not observed after monitoring for 40 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have required glucocorticoids to control SLE during pregnancy may need an increased dose, called a stress dose, during delivery. The increased dose helps the body respond normally to the physical stresses of childbirth.</p><p>Most women with lupus are able to have an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. However, since there is an increased risk of premature rupture of the membranes, of a small infant, and of preeclampsia, women with lupus are advised to deliver in a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications that are typically used to treat SLE may be divided into three categories: those that should be avoided during pregnancy, those that may have a small risk of harm to the fetus, and those that are probably safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Drugs to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications that should be avoided during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mycophenolate mofetil</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyclophosphamide</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methotrexate &ndash; Men and women who take methotrexate should stop one to three months before trying to conceive. This three-month period is necessary to completely eliminate methotrexate from the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologic medications &ndash; There are insufficient data about the safety of biologic agents in pregnancy. Biologic agents include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, anakinra, rituximab, and abatacept. Until more data are available, biologic medications should be avoided in pregnancy whenever possible.</p><p/><p>If you take one of these medications and become pregnant, talk to your doctor immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Drugs with a small risk of harm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, prednisone, and azathioprine have a small risk of causing fetal harm; their use may be acceptable if necessary to control SLE during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs &ndash; NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve), cross the placenta and can potentially cause harm to the fetus during the third trimester (after 30 weeks of pregnancy). Women who have trouble becoming pregnant should avoid NSAIDs while trying to become pregnant because NSAIDs may interfere with ovulation and embryo implantation. NSAIDs may be taken, however, during the second trimester of pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A safe alternative to NSAIDs for treatment of pain during pregnancy is acetaminophen (Tylenol). A safe dose of acetaminophen is two 325 mg tablets or capsules every four to six hours as needed. No more than 3000 mg of acetaminophen should be taken per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspirin &ndash; Aspirin crosses the placenta. Low-dose aspirin (less than 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> has been used safely in the treatment of pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome. However, increased rates of stillbirth have been reported with aspirin doses greater than 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Women should speak with their obstetric or rheumatology care provider about the risks and benefits of taking aspirin during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prednisone &ndash; If SLE flares during pregnancy, most experts recommend starting prednisone (a glucocorticoid, or steroid, commonly used in treating SLE) at the lowest dose possible. Prednisone crosses the placenta but appears in only small amounts in the infant's blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Glucocorticoids may increase the risk of premature rupture of membranes (breaking the water early) and of growth restriction (having a lower birthweight infant). They can also can increase the risk of pregnancy-induced diabetes and high blood pressure in the mother.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive medications &ndash; Azathioprine, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus are considered compatible during pregnancy. There are reassuring data in women who have received organ transplants to suggest that these medications do not increase the risk of fetal anomalies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Drugs that are safe during pregnancy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimalarial drugs &ndash; There is no evidence that antimalarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, increase the risk of miscarriage or birth defects at normal doses. These medications are safe to use while breastfeeding. Women with SLE should be encouraged to continue their antimalarial drugs during pregnancy as they may decrease the risk of flares, help manage the antiphospholipid syndrome, and possibly decrease the risk of neonatal lupus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AFTER DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women will experience a flare of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) after delivery. Women who have had active disease in early pregnancy and those with significant organ damage are at greater risk of disease flares.
