Most patients are sensitized through exposure to latex gloves or other latex products (eg, dental dams, condoms, and balloons) in a medical or occupational setting.</p><p>The mainstay of management of latex allergy is avoidance of latex products. Several other therapeutic approaches have been under investigation, including immunotherapy (IT) and anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy, but these have not shown promise.</p><p>The management of latex allergy, including avoidance measures and experimental therapies that have been attempted, will be reviewed here. An overview of latex processing and latex allergens and review of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of latex allergy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Latex allergy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latex allergy can involve delayed or immediate-type reactions. Individuals with delayed hypersensitivity, manifested as a contact dermatitis, are at increased risk for developing immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions. Thus, all individuals with latex sensitivity, as documented by a positive <em>Hevea</em> latex-specific IgE antibody response, should be managed similarly.</p><p>There are four possible strategies for preventing or managing allergic symptoms once an individual is diagnosed with latex allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy (IT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-IgE therapy</p><p/><p>Of these, the most effective and least expensive method is avoidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Institutional avoidance'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Individual avoidance'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of acute and chronic allergic symptoms with pharmacotherapy is possible. However, prevention of reactions is preferred. Unfortunately, preventive pharmacotherapy is rarely effective.</p><p>The use of IT is limited due to the high frequency of adverse reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Anti-IgE therapy is under investigation for use in patients with IgE-mediated latex allergy as an off-label indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Anti-IgE is sometimes used together with an IT regimen. It is costly, and patients must have the appropriate body weight and total serum IgE level between 30 and 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">kU/L</span> to be a candidate for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTITUTIONAL AVOIDANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a general misconception that a &quot;latex-free&quot; environment, which is totally devoid of natural rubber latex (NRL) products, is both achievable and required to establish a safe environment for patients and employees with latex allergy. A completely latex-free environment is not readily achievable. In contrast, effective institutional avoidance of latex allergen can be accomplished by establishing a latex-&quot;safe&quot; environment. Creation of a latex-safe environment involves recognizing the importance of controlling latex exposure for allergic patients and employees, convening a latex committee, and establishing an institutional program to eliminate latex allergen exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/3,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-11</a>]. A multidisciplinary latex advisory committee should be composed of local experts with knowledge in legal matters, purchasing, occupational safety, allergy, and glove use, including surgery, medicine, and anesthesiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/1,9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,12,13</a>].</p><p>Establishment of latex-safe environmental policies involves replacing <em>Hevea</em> latex-containing products with non-<em>Hevea</em>-based synthetic products, if possible, or, at a minimum, powder-free latex products (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hevea latex alternatives'</a> below). Powder-free NRL products undergo a final chlorination step that removes a large percentage of <em>Hevea</em>-allergenic protein.</p><p>The primary source of <em>Hevea</em> latex exposure in medical institutions is the medical <span class=\"nowrap\">examination/surgical</span> glove (both nonsterile and sterile gloves) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,15</a>]. Some institutions have globally converted only their examination gloves to synthetic alternatives, while others have transitioned all gloves to non-<em>Hevea</em> alternatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/4,9,11,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,11,13,16</a>].</p><p>Establishing a latex-safe environment in an institution leads to a decrease in latex-induced symptoms and reported employee and patient sensitivity. However, latex-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody can remain detectable in the skin and blood of individuals who avoid latex exposure for at least five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/3,4,11,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11,17-20</a>]. Thus, continued avoidance is recommended. Yearly serologic evaluation should be considered to monitor for possible resolution of sensitization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDIVIDUAL AVOIDANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All individuals with latex allergy, whether or not they come in contact with potentially contaminated body fluids, should use only non-<em>Hevea</em> medical gloves. In addition to gloves, there are as many as 40,000 consumer products in home and <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/dental</span> environments that may contain latex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Examples are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59584 \">table 1</a>). Latex-containing forms of these products should be avoided as well. In the United States, <em>Hevea</em> latex-containing medical devices must be labeled &quot;containing natural rubber latex&quot; with a medical alert boxed warning. Unfortunately, there is no requirement for companies to label rubber products with their latex protein content. Consumer products do not have the same stringent labeling requirement; however, many are labeled as containing latex.</p><p>For high-risk health care workers and sensitized patients, latex avoidance is critically important to reduce current symptoms and further sensitization. Institutions that have an employee with latex allergy must adhere to strict policies. At a minimum, such policies permit only the use of powder-free latex products for all employees and latex-free products for the sensitized individual. It is not acceptable to only give the worker with latex allergy special latex-free gloves, since their environment can endanger them if a coworker inadvertently uses a <em>Hevea</em> allergen-rich glove. Use of powder-free latex gloves by coworkers decreases, but does not eliminate, symptoms in health care workers with latex allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HEVEA ALLERGEN CONTENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measuring the level of <em>Hevea</em> allergens in various products and occupational settings can document the risk for <em>Hevea</em> allergen exposure. This determination can be used to assess the necessity for an institutional transition to non-<em>Hevea</em> latex-containing products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/9,12,13,16,17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13,16,17,24</a>]. It is not known what the safe threshold limits are for latex aeroallergen exposure. One earlier study using older assay methods suggested a latex aeroallergen threshold of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nanograms/cubic</span> meter of air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Similar threshold determinations have not been performed using the newer immunoenzymetric assays (IEMAs).</p><p>The American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) has established three standardized assays for <em>Hevea</em> product and environmental monitoring:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total protein &ndash; The modified Lowry test (ASTM D5712) was the first assay developed to monitor total <em>Hevea</em> protein in product extracts or environmental specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This assay has limited analytic sensitivity. Thus, it is only able to quantify high levels of total extractable protein from <em>Hevea</em> rubber products. Moreover, it does not discriminate between allergenic and nonallergenic <em>Hevea</em> proteins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Hevea</em> antigens &ndash; <em>Hevea</em> proteins that elicit an antibody response can be detected with the ASTM D6499 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. This assay does not distinguish between latex allergens (immunoglobulin E [IgE] inducing) and nonallergenic antigens (non-IgE inducing), and, therefore, it only provides an indirect measure of the allergenic potential of a product or environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Hevea</em> allergens &ndash; Of the 15 known <em>Hevea</em> allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], <em>H. brasiliensis</em> (Hev b) 1, 3, 5, and 6.02 have been identified as the principal &quot;indicator&quot; allergens for monitoring products and environments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71927 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Latex allergy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Hevea indicator allergens'</a>). Two-site monoclonal antibody-based IEMAs (ASTM D7427-08) are established as standard methods that provide quantitative estimates of the indicator allergens in product extracts and environmental samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The sum of the Hev b 1, 3, 5, and 6.02 content in physiologic extracts reflects the allergenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Quantification of Hev b 1 and Hevamine alone is insufficient to effectively assess rubber product allergen potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>Other assays for <em>Hevea</em> allergens, such as the human IgE anti-latex-based competitive inhibition assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], remain research tools in selected laboratories due to their requirement for large amounts of human IgE anti-latex-containing serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HEVEA LATEX ALTERNATIVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synthetic elastomers and a non-<em>Hevea</em> rubber (Yulex) have been developed for use as alternatives in the manufacturing of commercial &quot;rubber-like&quot; products:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common synthetic elastomers include butyl rubber, a completely petroleum-based product with no allergenic protein, polymers of 2-chlorobutadiene (neoprene), and copolymers of butadiene and acrylonitrile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The predominant nonsterile, nonlatex examination gloves used in medical institutions today are made of nitrile, neoprene, vinyl, or synthetic polyisoprene rubber that is extracted from oil. Their color (white, blue, purple, or green) is arbitrary and does not reflect the type of material in the glove. Different glove materials vary in terms of their ability to be sterilized and still maintain their barrier properties.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A non-<em>Hevea</em> source of natural rubber is the Guayule plant (Yulex) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The raw material extracted from the shrub has an ultra-low protein content. The proteins that are present display no apparent in vitro or in vivo crossreactivity with <em>Hevea</em> latex allergens. Thus, Yulex-based rubber products should pose no risk to individuals who are allergic to <em>Hevea</em> latex. In the United States, Yulex-based products are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but are not yet commercially available.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN THE WORKPLACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic approach for managing a worker with suspected natural rubber latex (NRL) allergy begins with confirmation of the diagnosis of latex allergy using validated diagnostic methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/1,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,16</a>]. Confirmation of latex sensitization can justify efforts put forth for cessation of further NRL exposure in the patient's workplace.</p><p>One must then document that impairment and disability results from latex exposure in the workplace. The employer then needs to be educated about the patient's diagnosis and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> responsibility to provide effective interventions to create a latex-safe environment. If the patient cannot be effectively accommodated, workers' compensation benefits and rehabilitation may be appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2018885927\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT IN SCHOOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic approach for managing a confirmed natural rubber latex (NRL) allergy in a student in a school program begins with development of an individualized health care plan and a school-wide avoidance plan. Education of the student on self-management skills is vital if the child has a risk of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT BY THE INDIVIDUAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several measures for the latex-allergic individual are recommended to prevent and manage allergic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/21,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A medical alert bracelet indicating latex allergy should be worn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should be prescribed for all individuals with a clinical history of systemic reactions to latex.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Evaluation and prevention of recurrent reactions&quot;, section on 'Latex'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An extensive allergy history should be obtained if a patient has an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to a consumer product within minutes of contact and natural rubber latex (NRL) is suspected. All sensitivities should be considered possible causes. As an example, casein, a component of cow's milk that was incorporated into the spongy padding of boxing gloves, and not <em>Hevea</em> latex, was identified as the trigger of a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction that occurred in a woman with milk allergy immediately after she donned a new pair of kick boxing gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of immunotherapy (IT) for the treatment of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated latex allergy is limited by the frequency and severity of reactions to IT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Several small, randomized trials were performed with conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) using crude latex extracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Efficacy was variable. One trial demonstrated decreased symptoms of urticaria and rhinoconjunctivitis but not asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], whereas another did show reduced airway hyperreactivity to latex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A third trial failed to demonstrate any difference in medication use or symptom scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A high frequency of adverse events, including systemic reactions, was reported in all studies. In one trial, adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both the induction and maintenance phases of the regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest that the frequency and severity of adverse events is lower with sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) compared with SCIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. However, results vary, and anaphylaxis has been reported with SLIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>].</p><p>Novel IT approaches are under investigation to decrease the risk of severe adverse reactions (allergenicity) and yet maintain or improve efficacy (immunogenicity). These approaches include recombinant allergens, T cell epitope-based peptides, and adjuvants that are conjugated to or coadministered with the allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-management/abstract/21,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,54</a>].
