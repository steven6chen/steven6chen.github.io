It causes a cough that brings up mucus (phlegm) every day for 3 months or longer.</p><p>Chronic bronchitis is 1 of the 2 main types of a serious lung disease called &quot;COPD.&quot; The other main form of COPD is called &quot;emphysema.&quot; COPD can make it hard to breathe. Both types of COPD are often caused by smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058736\"><span class=\"h1\">Why did I get chronic bronchitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is smoking, which can damage the lungs forever. People can also get chronic bronchitis from breathing in toxic fumes or gases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058751\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a cough on most days for at least 3 months, for 2 years in a row</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing or spitting up clear or white mucus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling short of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest discomfort or tightness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058766\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor might do several tests, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray &ndash; This can show other conditions that might be causing your cough, such as pneumonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirometry &ndash; During this test, you take a deep breath and then blow out as fast and hard as you can into a tube. A machine connected to the tube measures how much air you can blow out of your lungs and how fast you can blow.</p><p/><p>If the results of your spirometry are <strong>not</strong> normal, your doctor or nurse will give you medicine in an inhaler. Then he or she will test you again. This will help the doctor or nurse find out if your problem is caused by chronic bronchitis or another lung problem, such as asthma. People with asthma usually have normal results after they use an inhaler. People with chronic bronchitis do not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058781\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you smoke, stop. This is the most important thing you can do for your chronic bronchitis. It does not matter how long you have smoked or how much you smoke. Quitting will slow your disease and help you feel better.</p><p>You should also get the flu shot every fall and the pneumonia vaccine at least once. Infections like the flu and pneumonia can hurt your lungs. It's important to try to prevent them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058796\"><span class=\"h1\">How is chronic bronchitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 3 main types of treatment for chronic bronchitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; There are a lot of prescription medicines to treat chronic bronchitis. Most people use inhalers that help open up their airways or that reduce swelling in the airways. Often people need more than 1 inhaler at a time. Sometimes, people need a medicine called prednisone that comes in pills when their symptoms get worse than normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen &ndash; If the disease gets worse, some people need to use oxygen for breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary rehab &ndash; In pulmonary rehab, people learn things they can do to improve their symptoms. They learn exercises and ways to breathe that can help ease symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058811\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breathing-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breathing tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-prevention-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=supplemental-oxygen-on-commercial-airlines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Supplemental oxygen on commercial airlines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
