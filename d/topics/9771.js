It is viewed in terms of its phases: latent and active; and its stages: first, second, and third.</p><p>The latent phase of labor will be reviewed here. Other aspects of labor and labor abnormalities are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF LATENT PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial phase of labor is termed the latent phase. It is considered to begin at the time the woman first perceives regular uterine contractions, which is a subjective assessment. Although many clinicians document the beginning of the latent phase as the time contractions began to occur every three to five minutes for at least an hour, the time of onset of less frequent but regular and persistent contractions can also be considered the beginning of the latent phase. Over time, the contractions lead to cervical change.</p><p>This simple definition belies a complex process not completely understood by modern science. Women have irregular contractile activity beginning in the midtrimester, and gradual changes in the consistency, position, dilation, and effacement of the cervix occur over the remaining months of the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This makes accurate assessment of the onset of latent phase difficult since determining exactly when a patient has entered latent phase is primarily based upon the woman's history and the judgment of the attending provider.</p><p>The end of the latent phase occurs when the active phase begins (ie, the time at which the rate of cervical dilation accelerates). Precise determination of the time that latent phase ends is particularly problematic in an individual woman. Friedman found that the active phase usually began at 3 to 4 cm dilation, whereas Zhang and colleagues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] noted that parturients have diverse speeds of cervical dilation in the latent versus active phase and enter the active phase at various times, as measured by cervical dilation. Although some woman may enter the active phase before 6 cm dilation, rates of cervical dilation are more rapid beyond 6 cm in both nulliparas and multiparas. Thus, it is clinically practical to consider all women to be in active labor once they have reached a dilation of &ge;6 cm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression#H12634785\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;, section on 'Criteria for normal progress'</a>.)</p><p>In a systematic review including 62 studies, there was little consensus regarding definitions of labor onset and latent phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2329775661\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>False labor and latent phase of labor initially share similar characteristics. However, the contractions associated with latent labor become stronger, more regular, more frequent over time, and are associated with cervical change, whereas the Braxton-Hicks contractions associated with false labor diminish in frequency and intensity and are not associated with cervical change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF PROLONGED LATENT PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no uniformly accepted definition for a prolonged latent phase. It had been defined by Friedman as a nullipara who has not entered the active phase by 20 hours after the onset of the latent phase and a multipara who has not entered the active phase by 14 hours after the onset of the latent phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These criteria were based upon the 95th percentile for duration of the latent phase in women with spontaneous labor. If the duration of latent phase follows a normal Gaussian distribution, the overall incidence of prolonged latent phase in spontaneously laboring women should be 4 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>However, as discussed above, the moments of transition from normal uterine activity to latent labor to active labor cannot be determined precisely and are subjective, so determining the duration of normal and abnormal latent phase is problematic. Moreover, contemporary data show that many women with latent phases longer than the upper limit described by Friedman go on to have a normal active phase and vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, there is no contemporary uniformly applied definition of a prolonged latent phase. </p><p>The duration of latent phase in the induced labor is controversial, but appears to be longer than in spontaneous labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. During an induction, the normal biochemical and biomechanical processes occurring during spontaneous labor are distorted. Heterogeneity of induction methods, indications, and socioeconomic factors complicate any analysis of latent phase duration. Pragmatic definitions for a prolonged latent phase have been developed to address latent phase cesarean delivery for a failed induction. These definitions and the evidence supporting them are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for a long latent phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of the latent phase is variable and affected by internal and external factors, many of which are undefined. Women with favorable cervixes at the onset of labor appear to have a shorter latent phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. By comparison, one-half of women who enter latent phase with an unfavorable cervix go on to have a prolonged latent phase (by Friedman&rsquo;s definition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other risk factors include transverse and occiput posterior position, sedation, and analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,14</a>].</p><p>The effects of epidural analgesia administered during the latent phase on the time to and mode of delivery are controversial. Epidural advocates argue that dysfunctional labor is particularly painful and patients with dysfunctional labor are more apt to request epidural at an earlier point in their labor. This argument is supported by evidence from a randomized trial that showed that early epidural did not prolong the duration of labor or increase the cesarean delivery rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H100840725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Effects on the progress and outcome of labor'</a>.)</p><p>Women admitted to the labor unit in latent phase are more likely to have a long labor than women admitted in the active phase. It is unclear whether inherent labor abnormalities are the root cause of both latent phase presentation and subsequent labor abnormalities or whether latent phase admission prompts clinical interventions that lead to labor abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Maternal age, infant birth weight, pelvic capacity, and gestational age do not have significant effects on length of the latent phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479041493\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences of a long latent phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A long latent phase during spontaneous labor is associated with a higher risk of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. One possible reason for the increased rate of cesarean delivery is that a long latent phase may be misdiagnosed as a protraction or arrest disorder in the active phase. As a result, an unwarranted cesarean delivery may be performed during false labor or latent labor.</p><p>Friedman found that women with prolonged latent phase who eventually achieved a normal pattern of dilation and descent were not more prone to developing active phase protraction and arrest disorders than parturients with a normal latent phase, and perinatal mortality was not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Others, however, have reported prolonged latent phase is associated with a higher risk of subsequent labor abnormalities, and that newborns are more likely to be exposed to thick meconium, have depressed five-minute Apgar scores, and require neonatal intensive care unit admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF LATENT PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A latent phase that extends for many hours or days can be physically and emotionally exhausting for the parturient. In addition to education, support, hydration, and comfort measures (eg, massage, water immersion), management options for spontaneously laboring women who are not tolerating latent phase include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterotonic drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniotomy </p><p/><p>Our preference is therapeutic rest for women who are tired and uncomfortable in early latent phase, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> for a woman who is well rested or has already received therapeutic rest. Amniotomy alone is not effective.</p><p>Before considering these options, it is important to evaluate the pregnancy to determine whether there are obstetrical problems that should be addressed. For example, therapeutic rest is not appropriate if there are maternal or fetal indications for delivery, such as preeclampsia, abruptio placenta, chorioamnionitis, or an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern. Uterotonic drugs may not be appropriate if there is a fetal malpresentation or a hysterotomy scar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic rest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic rest involves administration of parenteral analgesics or sedatives to relieve the patient's discomfort and allow for progression of labor while she rests or sleeps. At many hospitals, these women are placed in an observation area for rest, rather than admitting them to labor and delivery, which has cost implications.</p><p>The decision to observe the patient in the hospital or to send her home is based upon the provider's assessment of the patient (eg, psychological state, fatigue, parity, cervical status, medical and obstetrical problems, distance from the hospital) and the fetal status, and, to a lesser extent, bed availability. If a decision is made to move toward delivery, regional analgesia is an option to provide therapeutic rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4246740298\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug dosing</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opioids</strong> -- <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> or another opioid analgesic may be used for therapeutic rest. We administer 5 to 10 mg intramuscularly and intravenously simultaneously, not to exceed 20 mg.&nbsp;It is particularly useful in women who are tired, uncomfortable, and in early latent phase. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one review, approximately 85 percent of women treated with these regimens woke up in the active phase of labor, 10 percent were not in labor (suggesting a diagnosis of false labor), and 5 percent had a persistent dysfunctional pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A more contemporary study reported 62 percent woke up in active labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sedatives</strong> -- Another common practice, after ensuring maternal and fetal well-being, is to offer use of a sedative at home; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> (5 mg orally) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secobarbital</a> (100 mg orally) are two commonly prescribed agents.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxytocin augmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Augmentation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> appears to aid progression of labor from the latent to active phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In his classic report, Friedman concluded that oxytocin and therapeutic rest were equally efficacious and safe in correcting a prolonged latent phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For women in latent phase, the average interval between initiation of oxytocin and active labor was 3.4 hours. </p><p>As discussed above, the duration of latent phase in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> induced labor appears to be longer than in spontaneous labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Nevertheless, in a contemporary population of women with unfavorable cervixes undergoing induction, about 70 percent of women exited the latent phase after 6 hours of oxytocin and membrane rupture and only 5 percent remained in the latent phase after 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This latter group was at high risk of cesarean delivery (only 40 percent delivered vaginally after 12 hours of oxytocin in the latent phase). The Consortium of Safe Labor study reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Among nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor with an unfavorable cervix (defined as initial cervical dilation &le;2 cm) and rupture of membranes, only 6.5 percent had not exited the latent phase (ie, achieved cervical dilation &ge;6 cm) by 12 hours; among multiparous women, only 1.5 percent had not exited the latent phase by this time point. The rates of vaginal delivery in these women were 36.6 and 61 percent, respectively. </p><p>Prostaglandins, although widely used for cervical ripening and labor induction, have not been studied as a treatment for women with a long latent phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Amniotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniotomy has been reported to shorten the latent phase when used in active management of labor protocols, but most of the observed effect is thought to be related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> administration, which is often begun shortly after amniotomy in these protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A small randomized trial limited to women with prolonged latent phase (by Friedman&rsquo;s definition) noted that the combination of oxytocin and amniotomy significantly reduced the time from initiation of augmentation until delivery compared with either intervention alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The lack of efficacy of amniotomy alone for accelerating spontaneous labor in women with normal or prolonged latent phase was demonstrated in a 2013 systematic review of 15 randomized trials involving 5583 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Planned amniotomy did not significantly shorten the duration of the first stage of labor compared with planned 'no amniotomy' (weighted mean difference -20.4 minutes, 95% CI -95.9 to 55.1 minutes).</p><p>Although amniotomy is associated with an increase in maternal plasma prostaglandin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], the effects on the uterus and cervix are probably insufficient to result in significant augmentation of labor. Moreover, rupture of membranes diminishes the pressure of the bulging gestational sac against the cervix, which may adversely affect ripening, effacement, and dilation of the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latent-phase-of-labor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21122571\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventions to avoid</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cesarean delivery for failure to progress should not be performed during the latent phase of spontaneous labor, defined as cervical dilation &lt;6 cm.
