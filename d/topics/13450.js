Antithrombotic therapy has been shown to prevent periprocedural and long-term cardiovascular events such as stent thrombosis and recurrent myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-for-elective-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-general-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy for elective percutaneous coronary intervention: General use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Current antithrombotic regimens have the potential to result in either new gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or to exacerbate chronic episodic GI bleeding. For those with GI bleeding, there is significant attributable morbidity and mortality. However, in many such patients, alternatives to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be limited. Given the fact that over one million PCI procedures are performed annually, and that antithrombotic therapy has become more aggressive, there is a need to understand the unique challenges in the prevention and management of GI bleeding in this patient population. Furthermore, with the increasing adoption of a radial as compared to femoral artery approach, GI bleeding may be the most common type of bleeding associated with PCI.</p><p>This topic focuses on periprocedural and long-term GI bleeding in patients undergoing PCI. Issues of GI bleeding in patients on chronic anticoagulant or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy are discussed elsewhere.

While the use of these drugs is associated with an increase in the risk of GI bleeding, the magnitude of the increase has not been well studied. In a large cohort study from Denmark that included over 75,000 patients who took clopidogrel, the long-term risk of GI events (bleeding, ulcer, or gastritis) increased from about 2 to about 6 percent, comparing never-users with users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-and-long-term-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Thus, some have advocated P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker monotherapy for patients with gastrointestinal intolerance to aspirin.
