However, glaucoma is more accurately defined as an optic neuropathy and may not always be associated with increased IOP. Angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by narrowing or closure of the anterior chamber angle.</p><p>This topic will discuss types of angle-closure glaucoma, diagnosis, and treatment. A discussion of open-angle glaucoma is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-angle-glaucoma-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open-angle glaucoma: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND TYPES</span></p><p>Glaucoma is defined as an optic neuropathy involving a characteristic atrophy of the optic nerve head, often accompanied with typical visual field defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Examination of a glaucomatous optic nerve reveals &quot;cupping,&quot; which looks like a &quot;hollowing out&quot; of the optic nerve head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66101\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66101 \">picture 1</a>). Glaucoma is often, though not always, associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP).</p><p>Angle-closure glaucoma is a form of glaucoma characterized by narrowing or closure of the anterior chamber angle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The normal anterior chamber angle provides drainage for the aqueous humor, the fluid that fills the eyeball. When this drainage pathway is narrowed or closed, inadequate drainage of the aqueous humor leads to increased IOP and damage to the optic nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71234%7EPEDS%2F59454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71234 graphicRef59454 \">figure 1A-B</a>). Normal IOP is 8 to 21 mmHg. In acute episodes of closed-angle glaucoma, pressures are often 30 mmHg or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Angle-closure glaucoma is divided into two main groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary angle-closure &ndash; Patients are anatomically predisposed to this type of glaucoma; there is no identifiable secondary cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary angle-closure &ndash; A secondary process is responsible for narrowing or closure of the anterior chamber angle. Examples of secondary causes are a fibrovascular membrane that grows over the angle to pull it closed, as in neovascular glaucoma, or a mass or hemorrhage in the posterior segment of the eyeball that pushes the angle closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186681351\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After cataracts, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Angle-closure glaucoma is more prevalent in populations of Asian descent, whereas open-angle glaucoma is more common in populations of European or African descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In 2013, among people age 40 to 80, there were an estimated 20 million people with angle-closure glaucoma worldwide, with 75 percent in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is projected to increase to 32 million worldwide in 2020.</p><p>Risk factors that predispose to primary angle-closure glaucoma include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of angle-closure glaucoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;60 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperopia (farsightedness)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97120 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudoexfoliation (a condition in which abnormal flaky deposits on eye surfaces can weaken the zonules that support the lens and cause it to shift forward)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Race</p><p/><p>The highest rates of angle-closure glaucoma are reported in Inuit and Asian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>], and lower rates are reported in populations of African and European origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/2,12,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary angle-closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary body, flows through the pupil, reaches the anterior chamber angle, and exits the eye. The balance between fluid production and drainage determines the intraocular pressure.</p><p>In primary angle-closure, the lens is located too far forward anatomically and rests against the iris. This results in pupillary block, a condition in which aqueous humor can no longer flow normally through the pupil. Pressure builds up behind the iris, relative to the anterior chamber, causing the peripheral iris to bow forward and cover all or part of the anterior chamber angle.</p><p>Prolonged or repeated contact between the iris and the angle can lead to scarring and functional damage to the trabecular meshwork, the tissue in the angle that acts as a sieve through which the aqueous humor drains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71234%7EPEDS%2F59454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71234 graphicRef59454 \">figure 1A-B</a>). Once the optic nerve shows damage from the high intraocular pressure (IOP), the disease is called primary angle-closure glaucoma.</p><p>If the entire angle is blocked suddenly, as occurs in complete pupillary block, the IOP rises rapidly, and acute symptoms can occur. These attacks of acute angle-closure glaucoma may resolve spontaneously and recur repeatedly if not treated. Without treatment, vision loss and even blindness can occur quickly during the attack (over hours to days), so acute angle-closure glaucoma is a true ophthalmic emergency.</p><p>Patients with anatomically narrow angles are at risk for future angle-closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The width of their anterior chamber angles is smaller than in normal eyes, and their peripheral iris is closer to their anterior chamber angle than normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic angle-closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic angle-closure results if only a portion of the angle is blocked at a time and develops scarring. Over time, the angle may become progressively more closed. In this variation of the disease, the IOP may be normal or only slightly elevated, in which case symptoms will likely not occur. Patients with chronic angle-closure glaucoma may have more damage to the optic nerve and peripheral vision when the diagnosis is established, compared with patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma because of the absence of symptoms and thus delayed diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary angle-closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary angle-closure results when the anterior chamber angle becomes occluded as the result of conditions that push the iris or ciliary body forward (&quot;pushing&quot; conditions) or deform the iris so that it is retracted into the angle (&quot;pulling&quot; conditions).</p><p>Pushing conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosis of the pupil to the anterior surface of the lens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choroidal swelling or hemorrhage (due to types of ophthalmic surgery, retinal laser treatment, posterior scleritis, or drug reactions). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Topiramate</a> is the most common of the sulfa-based medications to cause this rare, idiosyncratic reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plateau iris syndrome (a developmental anomaly).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large or anteriorly displaced lens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aqueous misdirection (in which aqueous humor fills the vitreous cavity instead of flowing through the pupil, most commonly as a result of ophthalmic surgery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choroidal hemorrhage or effusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A space-occupying lesion in the posterior segment of the eyeball (such as a tumor or a gas bubble placed during retinal surgery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental syndromes causing fibrosis in the posterior segment of the eyeball</p><p/><p>Pulling conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation or blood in the angle itself that fibroses and contracts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neovascularization of the iris with a resulting fibrovascular membrane (most commonly seen in poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or ophthalmic artery insufficiency)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal corneal endothelial cell proliferation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged shallowing of the anterior chamber resulting in iris-angle contact due to trauma or surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelial cell or fibroblast invasion of the angle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapidity and degree of the intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation from angle-closure determines whether symptoms occur. If the IOP rises quickly, as is typical of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, patients may experience some or all of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Halos around lights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe eye pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p>If the rise in IOP is slower and does not reach very high levels, the patient may be symptom-free.

The angle of the fellow eye may be similarly narrow, putting this eye at risk for future angle-closure attacks unless prophylactic treatment is instituted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonioscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonioscopy is the gold-standard method of diagnosing angle-closure glaucoma. This technique involves using a special lens for the slit lamp, which allows the ophthalmologist to visualize the angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77383 \">picture 3</a>). Indentation gonioscopy refers to putting posterior pressure on the eyeball with the lens used for gonioscopy. The pressure will widen the angle if it is not scarred completely closed; the extent to which scarring has produced angle-closure helps to determine its severity and chronicity. Gonioscopy requires expertise and experience to perform reliably.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Slit lamp grading of anterior chamber depth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this technique, the width of the angle is estimated by shining a light beam from the slit lamp on the peripheral anterior chamber.

The ultrasound biomicroscope instrument is costly and thus not widely available. This technique also requires specialized interpretation of the results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18186052\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior segment optical coherence tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-definition anterior segment optical coherence tomography is being used as a modality to image the drainage angle and detect eyes at risk for angle-closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Findings suggest that eyes prone to developing angle-closure do not merely differ anatomically from normal eyes but may also respond differently to light stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As an example, when dilated to the same degree, the iris of an angle-closure eye tends to be thicker than the iris of a normal eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Provocative tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Provocative tests most often do not provide additional information beyond the clinical examination and are not widely used because of their risks. In the dark room provocation test, a patient rests (awake) in a dark room for 30 minutes with his or her head in the prone position to encourage pupillary dilation and forward displacement of the lens. Angle-closure is suggested if the IOP rises significantly or if the angle appears more closed on gonioscopy. Clinical applicability is unknown.</p><p>In pharmacologic tests, the pupil is dilated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> or parasympatholytic mydriatic eye drops and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> is instilled in an attempt to provoke an attack of angle-closure glaucoma. This procedure involves risk and a negative result does not absolutely rule out angle-closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both eyes should not be tested simultaneously. We do not recommend this test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p>Other causes of a red eye may mimic acute primary angle-closure glaucoma. These include iritis, traumatic hyphema, conjunctivitis, episcleritis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasion, and infectious keratitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The primary care clinician may be able to distinguish acute primary closure from these conditions by the presence of severe eye pain, headache, nausea and vomiting, a mid-dilated pupil, and possibly decreased vision. However, not every patient with acute angle-closure glaucoma will demonstrate all of these symptoms and signs.</p><p>Secondary causes of angle-closure are best differentiated from primary angle-closure by an ophthalmologist (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Secondary angle-closure'</a> above).

When an ophthalmologist is available for consultation within one hour of patient presentation, patients with signs or symptoms suggesting possible acute angle-closure should be referred for emergency assessment and treatment.</p><p>When there is likely to be an hour or more delay before a patient can be seen by an ophthalmologist, and the suspicion of an acute attack is high, empiric treatment should be initiated.

We suggest giving the patient two 250 mg tablets of acetazolamide by mouth in the office. The eye pressure should be checked 30 to 60 minutes after giving pressure-lowering drops and oral acetazolamide. Systemic medications other than oral acetazolamide should be administered under the guidance of an ophthalmologist, since angle-closure should be confirmed before they are given.</p><p>If medical treatment is successful in reducing IOP, as is most often the case, corneal edema and eye pain will typically lessen or resolve. Once the attack is broken, the treatment of choice is a peripheral iridotomy. If laser peripheral iridotomy fails to remain patent, or the cornea is too cloudy to visualize the iris, surgical peripheral iridectomy may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Laser peripheral iridotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This procedure creates a tiny hole in the peripheral iris through which aqueous humor can flow and reach the angle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Once the iridotomy is patent, pupillary block is bypassed. A peripheral iridotomy is usually created with a laser.</p><p>The IOP is rechecked 30 to 120 minutes after the iridotomy is performed, and mild steroid drops are given for several days.

Such medicines include over-the-counter decongestants, motion sickness medications, adrenergic agents, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anticholinergic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Once laser peripheral iridotomy has been performed, these medications are no longer contraindicated.</p><p>People with a family history of primary angle-closure glaucoma should undergo regular screening eye examinations for this condition, particularly as they reach middle age. The examining ophthalmologist should perform gonioscopy to assess for narrow angles, and evidence of prior angle-closure glaucoma; laser peripheral iridotomy should be performed if these are found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcomes of patients with angle-closure glaucoma depend on how early the disease is detected. Because glaucoma damage to the optic nerve is generally not reversible and can occur within a matter of hours in the case of an acute angle-closure attack, it is important that an ophthalmologist see these patients urgently to provide prompt diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The other eye also must be evaluated as prophylactic treatment with laser peripheral iridotomy can prevent future angle-closure. The outcome for patients with secondary angle-closure depends on its cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Angle-closure glaucoma (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glaucoma involves a characteristic atrophy of the optic nerve head (&quot;cupping&quot;), often with peripheral vision defects. Angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by narrowing or closure of the anterior chamber angle, leading to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and damage to the optic nerve. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drainage of aqueous humor through the anterior angle is blocked by anatomic narrowing of the angle in primary angle-closure glaucoma. Acute blockage is an ophthalmic emergency, since vision loss and blindness may occur quickly. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Primary angle-closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic angle-closure glaucoma may not develop increased IOP and symptoms, and diagnosis may be delayed resulting in more vision loss than patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chronic angle-closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary angle-closure is caused by a variety of processes that either push or pull the anterior chamber angle closed. These may include fibrosis and scarring, drug reactions, neovascularization, or mass. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Secondary angle-closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma present with vision loss, headache, severe eye pain, light halos, nausea, and vomiting. Ocular exam reveals a red eye, corneal cloudiness or edema, a shallow anterior chamber, and poorly reactive mid-dilated pupil. Urgent referral for ophthalmology consultation is necessary in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of angle-closure glaucoma is established by gonioscopy. Provocative tests are not recommended. The fellow eye should be examined as well as the affected eye. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with symptoms and signs suggesting an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma require emergency care by an ophthalmologist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74621 \">table 2</a>). We recommend emergency use of topical ophthalmic medications to reduce IOP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). These drugs may include a beta-blocker, an alpha agonist, and an agent to produce miosis. We also suggest systemic medication to decrease IOP, which may include oral or intravenous [IV] <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, oral glycerol, or isosorbide (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Once the acute attack is controlled, definitive treatment for angle-closure glaucoma is a laser peripheral iridotomy to provide a small drainage hole through the iris. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with narrow anterior chamber angles who are awaiting surgery should be advised to avoid decongestants and anticholinergic medications, which may precipitate an attack. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Patient instructions'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angle-closure-glaucoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Prum BE Jr, Rosenberg LF, Gedde SJ, et al.
