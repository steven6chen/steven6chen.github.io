Other disadvantages include pungency and a high incidence of airway irritation (eg, coughing, salivation, breath-holding, laryngospasm) if concentrations &gt;1.5 MAC are employed. Also, a higher incidence of coughing has been noted during emergence, compared with sevoflurane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence/abstract/9,10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12,13</a>] (see <a href=\"#H694433697\" class=\"local\">'Airway or respiratory problems'</a> below).

(See <a href=\"#H128608054\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of general anesthesia may be accomplished by employing a primary inhalation technique, a primary intravenous (IV) technique, or a technique that combines anesthetic agents administered by both routes. Coadministration of different anesthetic agents results in synergistic effects that reduce the total dose of each agent and the incidence of drug-related side effects. (See <a href=\"#H1704129256\" class=\"local\">'Selection of maintenance agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhalation anesthetic dosing is determined by agent potency, reported as a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value (concentration of inhalation anesthetic agent in the alveoli required to prevent movement in response to a surgical stimulus in 50 percent of patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109424 \">table 3</a>). MAC differs for each agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109494 \">table 4</a>) and is affected by patient age, comorbidities, and concurrent administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) or IV anesthetic agent(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109495 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1762635082\" class=\"local\">'Inhalation anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advantages of the potent volatile inhalation agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, halothane) include dose-dependent decreases in skeletal muscle tone, bronchodilation (except desflurane), and cerebral metabolic rate. Disadvantages include dose-dependent systemic vasodilation with decreased blood pressure (BP), dose-dependent respiratory depression, and the potential to precipitate malignant hyperthermia. Also, inhalation anesthetic agents are associated with increased risk of nausea and emesis in the postoperative period, compared with most IV anesthetic alternatives.

N<sub>2</sub>O is always avoided in patients with pre-existing bowel distention, increased middle ear pressure, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumocephalus, intraocular gas, or venous air embolism. Disadvantages include a modestly higher incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) than other inhalation anesthetic agents, although this is mitigated by antiemetic prophylactic measures. (See <a href=\"#H283253190\" class=\"local\">'Nitrous oxide gas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total IV anesthesia (TIVA) employs an IV sedative-hypnotic anesthetic (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>) and an analgesic agent (typically an opioid). Other IV adjuvants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) may be employed to reduce or replace propofol or opioid doses.

Propofol is infused at 75 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute,</span> with titration according to individual requirements, the degree of noxious surgical stimulation, and coadministration of other anesthetic agents. (See <a href=\"#H4116923945\" class=\"local\">'Sedative-hypnotic agent: Propofol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An opioid is most commonly employed as the analgesic component of a TIVA technique. Potential adverse effects include exacerbation of hypotensive effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, respiratory depression, bradycardia, PONV, ileus, constipation, delirium, pruritus, and potential for acute tolerance. Choice of a specific opioid is dependent upon patient- and procedure-specific factors. (See <a href=\"#H861399748\" class=\"local\">'Opioid agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexmedetomidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> infusion may be selected as an adjuvant for a TIVA technique, particularly if avoidance of opioid administration is desirable or if additional analgesia is required. Dexmedetomidine may cause hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia due to sympatholytic effects, while ketamine increases sympathetic tone with consequent increased heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and cardiac output (CO). (See <a href=\"#H128608633\" class=\"local\">'Dexmedetomidine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H128608667\" class=\"local\">'Ketamine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is typically employed if muscle relaxation in the surgical field <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> absence of movement are necessary. Disadvantages of neuromuscular blockade include elimination of purposeful movement as a sign of awareness and potential residual postoperative neuromuscular weakness, which may lead to respiratory complications. (See <a href=\"#H3887431196\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blocking agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of an NMBA is based on the planned duration of the surgical procedure, presence of renal or hepatic dysfunction, whether neuromonitoring is planned, and availability and cost of each agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F114271\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114271 \">table 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2224858488\" class=\"local\">'Specific agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergence is the gradual return of consciousness with intact protective reflexes (Stage I) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107796 \">table 1</a>). Preparations for emergence include timing of discontinuation or reversal of anesthetic agents, adjuvants, and NMBAs. The trachea may be extubated when the patient is able to protect his own airway, has resumed spontaneous breathing without assistance while maintaining adequate ventilation and oxygenation, and follows simple commands such as eye opening. (See <a href=\"#H283253221\" class=\"local\">'Emergence from general anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems during emergence include airway and respiratory problems that require urgent management. Also, excessive somnolence or emergence agitation are evaluated and treated before leaving the operating room.
