This autosomal recessive genetic disorder typically leads to a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with dysfunction of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells (T-B-NK- SCID) that presents in the first few months of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77724 \">table 1</a>). However, there are also a few patients with a later onset and relatively milder disease. The wide spectrum of the ADA deficiency phenotype is largely related to the variability in genetic mutations.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of ADA deficiency are presented in this topic review. The treatment of ADA deficiency is discussed separately, as is the related combined immunodeficiency disorder, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview of SCID and detailed discussions on other SCID syndromes and combined immunodeficiencies are also covered separately.

It accounts for approximately one-third of all cases of autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and approximately 15 percent of all cases of SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADA deficiency is caused by mutations in the ADA1 gene at 20q13.11 (MIM 608958) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. ADA is an ubiquitous enzyme found in all cells, including red and white blood cells, and in the serum. It catalyzes the deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, which are converted to waste products and excreted. In the absence of functional ADA, there is an intracellular accumulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine. The replicative activity of the cell dictates the level of sensitivity to these toxic metabolites.</p><p>Adenosine and deoxyadenosine are also converted to 5'-deoxyadenosine triphosphates (dATP), which inhibit ribonucleotide reductase and prevent de novo synthesis of nucleotides and deoxynucleotides. There is a decrease in DNA synthesis in replicating cells because of the depletion of deoxynucleotides. In addition, deoxyadenosine irreversibly binds to and inhibits S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which also contributes to abnormal DNA synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>ADA concentration is highest in the thymus, which probably accounts for the dependence of T cell development and maturation upon this enzyme. The absence of ADA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of purine toxic metabolites may therefore be responsible for the early involution and dysplasia of the thymus observed with this disorder.</p><p>Several in vitro models have attempted to unravel the mechanisms by which ADA deficiency causes this immune aberration. These models have relied upon two competitive inhibitors of ADA, erythro-9-(2hydroxy-3nonyl) adenine (EHNA) and 2'deoxycoformycin (dCF). In vitro, both compounds suppress lymphocyte mitogenic and antigenic responses that are partially reversed by exogenous ADA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The effect of ADA inhibition was studied in a chimeric <span class=\"nowrap\">human/mouse</span> fetal thymic organ culture that mimicked an in vivo environment in which toxic metabolites accumulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thymocyte expansion and differentiation was impaired by ADA inhibition. The decrease in mature thymocytes was primarily due to apoptosis that was associated with accumulation of intracellular dATP. Inhibition of adenosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase prevented accumulation of dATP and restored thymocyte proliferation and differentiation. T cell apoptosis was abundant in thymi of ADA<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></span> mice, but no increase in apoptosis was detected in the spleen and lymph nodes of these animals, suggesting that the defect is specific to developing thymocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, human studies in five ADA-deficient patients showed that in vitro peripheral blood lymphocyte treatment with ADA metabolites induced a three- to fourfold higher proportion of<sup> </sup>apoptotic cells in ADA<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></span> T cells compared with<sup> </sup>normal cells, suggesting that mature ADA-deficient T cells are also prone to increased apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>ADA-deficient individuals typically have severely reduced numbers of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, some patients may retain NK cells and even B cells. Patients with ADA-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) often have myeloid dysplasia and bone marrow hypocellularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) is a growth factor encoded by the cat eye syndrome chromosome region, candidate 1 (<em>CECR1</em>) gene that has partial structural homology with ADA1. Both ADA1 and ADA2 convert adenosine to inosine and 2-deoxyadenosine to 2-deoxyinosine, but the affinity of ADA2 for adenosine is much lower. Autosomal recessive deficiency of ADA2 due to loss-of-function mutations can cause a spectrum of inflammatory phenotypes ranging from polyarteritis nodosa with a variable presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] to a syndrome that includes fevers, livedoid rash, and early-onset strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>] to diverse hematologic abnormalities (eg, pure red cell aplasia, hemolytic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia) without vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], depending upon the location of the mutations. Several relatives who carry the same mutations as the index cases were asymptomatic at the time of genetic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The accumulation of deoxyadenosine nucleotides in red blood cells typical for ADA1 deficiency is absent in patients with ADA2 deficiency. In addition, the immune aberrations reported were relatively minor, with mild lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin M [IgM] or immunoglobulin G [IgG] deficiency) and T and B cell functions that were by and large normal. Some patients had recurrent bacterial and viral infections. These disorders are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-and-young-adults-etiology-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children and young adults: Etiology and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical spectrum of ADA deficiency has broadened over time as patients with atypical or milder forms have been identified due to the variability of specific genetic mutations.</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of ADA-deficient individuals have a classic severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype in which the disease presents in the first months of life. Most of the remainder may have a &quot;delayed&quot; (6 to 24 months) or &quot;late&quot; (four years to adulthood) onset form. Such patients may initially have variable numbers of circulating lymphocytes and some humoral immunity that quickly wanes. As little as 3 percent of residual enzyme activity can maintain nearly functional immunity into adulthood. Thus, a few patients have maintained normal immune function until immunologic decompensation occurs in adulthood and infectious complications bring attention to the diagnosis. Patients with &quot;partial&quot; ADA deficiency, who have enzyme activity ranging from 5 to 80 percent of normal, have also been described. In some cases, somatic mutations may even lead to a spontaneous cure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most affected patients present with life-threatening infections, chronic persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive in the first months of life. This phenotype is almost indistinguishable from that of ADA-positive SCID. The disease is invariably fatal in the first year or two of life without treatment among these early-onset patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some neonates present with prolonged hyperbilirubinemia and hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In others, a severe neonatal graft-versus-host disease is the initial manifestation at birth. This is characterized by a maculopapular rash that becomes desquamative, acute necrotizing hepatitis with jaundice, interstitial pneumonitis, and massive diarrhea.

However, milder forms of the disease have also been identified. The severity depends upon the extent of the quantitative and qualitative ADA deficiency. The following observations suggest that ADA deficiency should be considered even in older individuals who present with unexplained lymphopenia and immune deficiency and that partial ADA deficiency can lead over time to a deterioration of immune function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four children with partial ADA deficiency were described in one case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Studies include the measurement of immunoglobulin levels, absolute numbers and percentages of lymphocyte subsets (T, B, and natural killer [NK]), and assessment of T cell function. In this situation, T cell function is usually determined by in vitro measurement of responses to mitogens, such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (ConA).

TRECs are T cell receptor excision circles, formed during the differentiation of T cells in the thymus. They serve as a marker for na&iuml;ve T cells in the peripheral blood and can be enumerated using dried blood spots on newborn screening cards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of functional ADA, there is an intracellular accumulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine. These products are toxic to lymphocytes. The wide spectrum of the ADA deficiency phenotype is largely related to the variability in genetic mutations. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADA deficiency typically leads to a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with dysfunction of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells (T-B-NK- SCID) that presents in the first few months of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77724 \">table 1</a>). However, there are also a few patients with a later onset and relatively milder disease.
