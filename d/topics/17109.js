In these individuals, symptoms are frequent and potentially disabling due to the interaction between the two processes. &#160;</p><p>This topic will focus on the management of AF in patients with HF.

They present conflicting data as to whether AF is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/3-5,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,21-24</a>]. A 2009 meta-analysis of 16 studies involving 53,969 patients concluded that AF was independently associated with all-cause mortality with an odds ratio of 1.4 for seven randomized trials and 1.15 for nine observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There is some evidence that new-onset AF predicts HF progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>These studies come to differing conclusions with regard to the impact on mortality of the development of HF in patients with AF. In one registry study of nearly one million patients, 3.4 percent were in AF without HF, 2.2 percent had HF in sinus rhythm, and 1.2 percent had HF in AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients that developed new-onset AF, HF, or both had significantly worse mortality (58.5, 70.7, and 74.8 percent, respectively) compared with those already with the condition at baseline (48.5, 63.7, and 67.2 percent, respectively). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2667459\"><span class=\"h1\">CORRECTION OF REVERSIBLE CAUSES OF AF AND HF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) may worsen symptoms in patients with heart failure (HF) and uncontrolled HF can accelerate the ventricular response of AF or precipitate AF in patients in sinus rhythm. For these reasons, all reversible causes of AF and HF should be identified and corrected when possible.

The initial strategy should be to treat the heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators, and other agents while also slowing the ventricular response of the AF. In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction &#160;with congestion or hypotension, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> are recommended to acutely control the heart rate. Beta blocker therapy should be instituted only following stabilization of patients with decompensated heart failure. Generally, nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists should be avoided due to their negative inotropic effects. Once the acutely decompensated heart failure has been adequately treated, amiodarone as an agent for chronic control of ventricular rate should be reserved for patients who do not respond to or are intolerant of digoxin or beta blockers. </p><p>Treatment of the heart failure patient with drugs to slow the ventricular response in AF is usually successful as the initial strategy to improve the clinical status. It is rarely necessary acutely to perform cardioversion from AF to normal sinus rhythm with acutely decompensated heart failure; hemodynamic instability is one exception. Cardioversion in the setting of acutely decompensated heart failure is commonly accompanied by early recurrence of AF. However, after stabilization of heart failure, cardioversion should generally be considered unless the patient has had drug resistant or longstanding persistent AF. &#160;</p><p>In some patients, persistent rapid ventricular rates in AF may contribute to myocardial dysfunction despite optimal medical therapy. In these patients, a strategy of rhythm control should be attempted. If unsuccessful, atrioventricular (AV) node ablation may be considered when rate cannot be controlled and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy is suspected. However, AV node ablation should not be performed without a pharmacological trial to control ventricular rate.

For some patients, a dramatic improvement with sinus rhythm is apparent. Thus, we have a lower threshold for rhythm control in patients with HF, as they are often more symptomatic than those without. Symptoms of irregular palpitations or racing heart, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, or exercise intolerance may be due to either AF or HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In this trial, 1376 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;35 percent, HF symptoms, and a history of paroxysmal (or persistent) AF were assigned to a strategy of either rhythm control (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>) or rate control (with beta blockers). At a mean follow-up of 37 months, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death from cardiovascular causes between the rhythm- and rate-control groups (27 versus 25 percent, respectively) or the outcome of the event-free survival. Improvements in quality of life and functional capacity were similar in treatment arms, as were assessments of the six-minute walk distance and New York Heart Association functional class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Rhythm control can also be achieved with catheter ablation. Four small randomized trials, each with methodological limitations, and one observational study have compared catheter ablation with rate control in patients with HF and found benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>].

This will allow for a determination if a symptom-rhythm correlation exists and whether a patient&rsquo;s HF symptoms can improve. If rhythm control (either using anti-arrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation) is not possible, then rate control may be preferred through more definitive means, including atrioventricular node ablation with pacing support. However, for these patients, unopposed right ventricular pacing can have a deleterious effect and even cardiac resynchronization pacing may not emulate electrical activation via the His Purkinje system. (See <a href=\"#H365855131\" class=\"local\">'AV node ablation with pacing'</a> below.)</p><p>In our experience some, if not many, patients with AF who have HF improve markedly with sinus rhythm restoration (if possible). For those with recent onset or symptomatic AF or with persistent symptomatic HF, cardioversion makes sense at least once as a test of therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, in many instances, repeat cardioversion is therapy enough as long as AF recurrence is not frequent.

Sinus rhythm is preferred to AF for most patients with reduced ejection fraction. </p><p>For patients with symptomatic AF who have heart failure and failure of antiarrhythmic drug therapy (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic drug therapy'</a> below), we treat with catheter ablation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Rhythm control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhythm control, which can be achieved with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, catheter ablation, or surgical ablation, is the preferred approach in patients with HF who are hemodynamically unstable or who are persistently symptomatic despite adequate rate control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is the treatment of choice in patients with recent onset AF in whom there is an exacerbation of HF even if rate control is achieved. </p><p>In some instances, direct current cardioversion may be necessary prior to or in conjunction with rhythm control, and this may even be necessary acutely for patients who have sudden precipitation of HF or the development of pulmonary edema. The trial of rate control, even under these circumstances, with attempted stabilization of the patient is recommended before acute cardioversion is anticipated.
