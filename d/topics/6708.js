There is a continuum of severity ranging from sepsis to septic shock. Although wide-ranging and dependent upon the population studied, mortality has been estimated to be &ge;10 percent and &ge;40 percent when shock is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In this topic review, the management of sepsis and septic shock is discussed. Our approach is consistent with 2016 guidelines issued by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. While we use the Society of Critical Care <span class=\"nowrap\">Medicine/European</span> Society of Intensive Care Medicine definitions, such definitions are not unanimously accepted. For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) still continues to support the previous definition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and severe sepsis. Definitions, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and investigational therapies for sepsis, as well as management of sepsis in the asplenic patient are reviewed separately.

While peripheral venous access may be sufficient in some patients, particularly for initial resuscitation, the majority will require central venous access at some point during their course. However, the insertion of a central line should not delay the administration of resuscitative fluids and antibiotics. A central venous catheter (CVC) can be used to infuse intravenous fluids, medications (particularly vasopressors), and blood products, as well as to draw blood for frequent laboratory studies. While a CVC can be used to monitor the therapeutic response by measuring the central venous pressure (CVP) and the central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>), evidence from randomized trials suggest that their value is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>].

Components of the protocols usually included the early administration of fluids and antibiotics (within one to six hours) using the following targets to measure the response: central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>) &ge;70 percent, central venous pressure (CVP) 8 to 12 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) &ge;65 mmHg, and urine output &ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span>.

In support of this hypothesis is that central line placement was common (&gt;50 percent) in control groups so it is likely that CVP and ScvO<sub>2</sub> were targeted in these patients. Furthermore, the mortality in studies that did not report a benefit to EGDT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>] approximated that of the treatment arm in the only study that reported benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One single center randomized trial of 263 patients with suspected sepsis reported a lower mortality in patients when ScvO<sub>2</sub>, CVP, MAP, and urine output were used to direct therapy compared with those in whom only CVP, MAP, and urine output were targeted (31 versus 47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Both groups initiated therapy, including antibiotics, within six hours of presentation. There was a heavy emphasis on the use of red cell transfusion (for a hematocrit &gt;30) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> to reach the ScvO<sub>2</sub> target in this trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three subsequent multicenter randomized trials of patients with septic shock, ProCESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], ARISE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and ProMISE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and two meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] all reported no mortality benefit (mortality ranged from 20 to 30 percent), associated with an identical protocol compared with protocols that used some of these targets or usual care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lack of benefit of resuscitation protocols has also been reported in low income settings. As an example, in a randomized trial of 212 patients with sepsis (defined as suspected infection plus two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria) and hypotension (systolic blood pressure &le;90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg) in Zambia, a protocolized approach of aggressive fluid resuscitation, monitoring, blood, and vasopressor transfusion within the first six hours of presentation resulted in a higher rate of death (48 versus 33 percent) when compared with usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, several flaws including crude measurements of monitoring, lower than usual rates of lactate elevation, larger than typical volumes of fluid resuscitation, and use of dopamine (as opposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>) in a population with a high percentage of patients with human immune deficiency virus may have biased the results.</p><p/><p>The importance of timely treatment, particularly with antibiotics, was illustrated in a database study of nearly 50,000 patients with sepsis and septic shock who were treated with various types of protocolized treatment bundles (that included fluids and antibiotics, blood cultures, and serum lactate measurements) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The general principles and examples of potential empiric regimens are given in this section but antimicrobial choice should be tailored to each individual.</p><p>For most patients with sepsis without shock, we recommend empiric broad spectrum therapy with one or more antimicrobials to cover all likely pathogens. Coverage should be directed against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and, if indicated, against fungi (eg, <em>Candida</em>) and rarely viruses (eg, influenza).

For actively breathing patients or those with irregular cardiac rhythms, an increase in the cardiac output in response to a passive leg-raising maneuver (measured by echocardiography, arterial pulse waveform analysis, or pulmonary artery catheterization) also predicts fluid responsiveness.

Other studies suggest that procalcitonin may distinguish infectious from noninfectious conditions and may therefore facilitate the decision to de-escalate empiric therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults/abstract/141,148-150\" class=\"abstract_t\">141,148-150</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Details regarding supportive therapies needed for the care of critically ill patients, including those with sepsis are provided separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood product infusion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of blood products in the critically ill&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrition (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress ulcer prophylaxis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress ulcer prophylaxis in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular blocking agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-acutely-ill-hospitalized-medical-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive insulin therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External cooling or antipyretics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-the-intensive-care-unit#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in the intensive care unit&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation, sedation, weaning (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Investigational therapies for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (eg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, antithrombin, thrombomodulin, heparin, cytokine and toxin inactivators, as well as hemofiltration, statins, beta-2 agonists, beta blockade, and vitamin <span class=\"nowrap\">C/thiamine/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a></span> combination) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-and-ineffective-therapies-for-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational and ineffective therapies for sepsis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-investigational-or-ineffective-pharmacotherapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Investigational or ineffective pharmacotherapy in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1365794740\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific guidelines on how to manage sepsis in pregnancy but most experts treat using the same principles as outlined in this topic being cognizant of the altered hemodynamics of pregnancy.

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Sepsis in adults (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with sepsis and septic shock, therapeutic priorities include securing the airway, correcting hypoxemia, and establishing vascular access for the early administration of fluids and antibiotics. Simultaneously obtaining the following is preferable (within 45 minutes) but should not delay the administration of fluids and antibiotics: routine laboratory studies, serum lactate, arterial blood gases, blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) from two distinct venipuncture sites and from indwelling vascular access devices, cultures from easily accessible sites (eg, sputum, urine), and imaging of suspected sources. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Immediate evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with sepsis and septic shock, we recommend the infusion of intravenous fluids <span class=\"nowrap\">(30mL/kg)</span> within the first three hours of presentation, rather than vasopressors, inotropes, or red blood cell transfusions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Fluid boluses are the preferred method of administration and should be repeated until blood pressure and tissue perfusion are acceptable, pulmonary edema ensues, or there is no further response. Crystalloid solutions (eg, normal saline or Ringer&rsquo;s lactate) are our preferred resuscitation fluid. We recommend that a hyperoncotic starch solution NOT be administered (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3877618\" class=\"local\">'Initial resuscitative therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous fluids (first three hours)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with sepsis, we recommend that optimal doses of empiric broad spectrum intravenous therapy with one or more antimicrobials be administered within one hour of presentation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Broad spectrum is defined as therapeutic agent(s) with sufficient activity to cover a broad range of gram negative and positive organisms and, if suspected, against fungi and viruses. For patients with septic shock, we suggest combination therapy, defined as multiple antibiotics (at least two) from different classes given with the intent of covering a known or suspected pathogen with more than one antibiotic. Agent selection depends upon patient's history, comorbidities, immune defects, clinical context, suspected site of infection, presence of invasive devices, Gram stain data, and local prevalence and resistance patterns. The routine administration of antifungal therapy is not warranted in non-neutropenic patients. (See <a href=\"#H1633281939\" class=\"local\">'Empiric antibiotic therapy (first hour)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3877618\" class=\"local\">'Initial resuscitative therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with sepsis and septic shock, we recommend that fluid management be guided using clinical targets including mean arterial pressure 65 mmHg to 70 mmHg (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mean-arterial-pressure-map\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and urine output &ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In addition, while dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness (eg, respiratory changes in the radial artery pulse pressure) are preferred, static measures of determining adequacy of fluid administration (eg, central venous pressure 8 to 12 mmHg or central venous oxygen saturation &ge;70 percent) may be more readily available. Serum lactate should be followed (eg, every six hours), until there is a definitive clinical response. It is prudent that other measures of the overall response to infection also be followed (eg, routine laboratory studies, arterial blood gases, microbiology studies). (See <a href=\"#H2170293153\" class=\"local\">'Monitor response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with sepsis who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation (eg, 3L in first three hours), we recommend vasopressors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>); the preferred initial agent is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F99963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99963 \">table 4</a>). For patients who are refractory to intravenous fluid and vasopressor therapy, additional therapies, such as glucocorticoids, inotropic therapy, and blood transfusions, can be administered on an individual basis. We typically reserve red blood cell transfusion for patients with a hemoglobin level &lt;7 g per deciliter. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Additional therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;, section on 'Choice of agent in septic shock'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following initial investigations and empiric antimicrobial therapy, further efforts aimed at identifying and controlling the source(s) of infection (ideally within 6 to 12 hours) should be performed in <strong>all</strong> patients with sepsis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58257\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58257 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59769\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59769 \">table 1</a>). In addition, for those who fail despite therapy or those who fail having initially responded to therapy, further investigations aimed at adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen or nosocomial super infection should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H2630969148\" class=\"local\">'Septic focus identification and source control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with sepsis who have demonstrated a response to therapy, we suggest that the rate of fluid administration should be reduced or stopped, vasopressor support weaned, and if necessary diuretics administered. We also recommend that antimicrobial therapy be narrowed once pathogen identification and susceptibility data return. Antimicrobial therapy should be pathogen- and susceptibility-directed for a total duration of 7 to 10 days, although shorter or longer courses are appropriate for select patients.
