Patients with these diseases are also at risk for the development of complications in organs outside of the gastrointestinal tract, including the eye (iritis and uveitis), hepatobiliary tract (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC]), and skin (eg, erythema nodosum). Routine monitoring for these complications is mandatory. Finally, the immunosuppressive medications that are used to manage patients with IBD leave them at increased risk for the development of routine and opportunistic infections.</p><p>These risks require special health maintenance considerations, as discussed in this topic. Related issues in the diagnosis and management of IBD are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-or-refractory-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe or refractory ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20631804\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING NUTRITIONAL STATUS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20631810\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth failure is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of IBD in children and is particularly common among those with Crohn disease (CD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Exacerbations of IBD may lead to an acute onset of anorexia, weight loss, and dehydration. More commonly in children, ongoing intestinal inflammation can manifest as chronic low-grade anorexia and may result in poor weight gain and decreased height velocity, which may lead to permanent stunting. Growth failure in children with IBD can be reversed or prevented if the disease is diagnosed expediently and well-controlled with medical interventions, while at the same time minimizing exposure to glucocorticoids and providing sufficient dietary energy and nutrients to ensure adequate weight gain.</p><p>All children with IBD should have regular measurements of body weight, height, and pubertal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Body mass index (BMI) should be calculated and tracked as well. Changes in BMI and height percentiles should be monitored over time by plotting on a standard chart. In general, these measurements should be obtained and recorded at least every four to six months for patients with quiescent disease, and more frequently in those patients with active disease or evidence of growth failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61093\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61093 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Radiographic determination of bone age can be a valuable component in the evaluation of children who present with growth failure, and results are abnormal in up to 40 percent of children with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Children with growth failure due to IBD typically have delayed bone age, which improves with effective medical treatment and nutrition. Interpretation of bone age requires the input of pediatric radiology and endocrinology staff. (See <a href=\"#H20631822\" class=\"local\">'Bone mineral density'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H282452950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Bone age determination'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20631816\"><span class=\"h2\">Micronutrient deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for monitoring nutritional status in children and adults with IBD vary between publications. Some authors recommend that healthy children with CD should be screened annually for micronutrient deficiencies, or more frequently if there is active disease or a history of surgical resection of the intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66288\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66288 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Low levels of vitamins A, D, and E, and of zinc, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">selenium</a> have been reported, especially in children with moderate or severe disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Vitamin B12 deficiency is most common in patients who have undergone ileal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Folate deficiency was observed in 20 to 60 percent of adults with IBD in older series but is uncommon in studies from the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sulfasalazine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> are at increased risk for folate deficiency and may require supplementation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Iron deficiency is common in patients with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This can be the result of a combination of poor dietary intake due to anorexia or dietary habits, increased iron loss due to inflammation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with moderate or severe intestinal disease activity may have difficulty tolerating oral iron supplements. A meta-analysis further demonstrated the improved efficacy and tolerance of parenteral iron therapy in adults with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Iron'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H2312433107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Inflammatory bowel disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20631822\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone mineral density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced bone mineral density or osteopenia is present in approximately 30 percent of children and adolescents with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The osteopenia in these patients may be the result of vitamin D deficiency, calcium malabsorption, pubertal delay, disease-related inflammatory activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Bone disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>We suggest that prevention and treatment of bone disease focus on intensive counseling to optimize nutrition, investigation of pubertal delay, and minimizing use of glucocorticoids. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D and calcium for children and adolescents with IBD is identical to that for their otherwise healthy peers. The recommended intake of vitamin D is 600 international units for children and adolescents. The recommended intake of calcium is 1000 mg daily for children 4 to 8 years of age, and this increases to 1300 mg daily for adolescents aged 9 to 18 years. Many children are unable to meet these levels by diet alone and will require supplements to achieve these goals. One guideline recommends higher intake of both of these nutrients in children and adolescents with IBD, targeting vitamin D intake of 800 to 1000 international units, and calcium intake of 1000 to 1600 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Calcium'</a>.) </p><p>Monitoring of serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) is recommended at least annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Ideally this should be performed in the late winter or early spring when vitamin D levels are at their annual nadir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Optimal 25-OHD concentrations have not been established for children, but studies suggest that levels above 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> will facilitate small bowel calcium absorption and blunt parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Further studies have suggested that 25-OHD levels in the 35 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> range may be necessary to optimize the beneficial effect(s) of this vitamin on the promotion of protective immunity and autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Many patients will require daily supplements, (delivered in the form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin D2</a> or D3) to maintain 25-OHD levels in this range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning can be used to evaluate bone density. The findings in children are expressed as Z-scores to reflect age-specific standards (rather than T-scores as in adults). Interpretation of DXA scanning for children remains problematic and requires adjustment for bone size; unadjusted DXA Z-scores for age and gender may systematically underestimate bone density in shorter patients or in patients with delay in growth and maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4,5,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,21,22</a>]. In children and adolescents with chronic illness, it is unclear whether modest decreases in bone density predict fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;, section on 'Children'</a>.)</p><p>There are no widely accepted standards for monitoring bone health in children with IBD. However, we suggest bone densitometry (DXA) in patients with risk factors for bone disease, including those with growth failure, secondary or primary amenorrhea, pubertal delay, refractory IBD, prolonged use of glucocorticoids, or history of clinically significant fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, we suggest performing bone densitometry in older children and adolescents with IBD at the time of diagnosis. One group suggests repeating the scan annually if the bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score is more than 1.0 standard deviation (SD) below the mean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Evaluation of bone density will enable clinicians to stratify which patients are most in need of closer follow-up <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nutritional supplementation. </p><p>Treatment with bisphosphonates is not recommended in children, except perhaps in unusual circumstances such as those who have experienced vertebral fracture. This is because these agents have extremely long half-lives and form bone with abnormal characteristics. As such, the long-term risks and benefits of these agents have not been fully delineated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24</a>]. Children with severe osteopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of recurrent fracture may benefit from referral to a specialist with expertise in endocrinology or bone health.

The relative infectious risks related to IBD therapy have not been fully established and likely vary with choice of drug and dose, as well as environmental and genetic risk factors specific to a particular patient. The known risks are discussed briefly below and in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and mycobacterial infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p>To minimize the risk of serious infection, we suggest that children undergo screening for tuberculosis (TB) prior to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> and other anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Screening is usually performed with Mantoux (PPD) skin testing, chest radiographs, or interferon-gamma release assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Testing for TB in children who have been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG), and management of patients who are thought to be anergic, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latent-tuberculosis-infection-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Latent tuberculosis infection in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20631834\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNIZATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend prompt review of a child's immunization status as soon as a diagnosis of IBD is suspected, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108934\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108934 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This should enable clinicians to complete any recommended immunization series, thereby ensuring optimal protection from vaccine-preventable diseases and minimizing potential conflicts between vaccinations and the initiation of immunosuppressive medications. It is particularly important to review the patient's status for live viral vaccines, including varicella and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) because administration of these live viral vaccines will be contraindicated <span class=\"nowrap\">if/when</span> the patient is later treated with high-level immunosuppressive drugs. (See <a href=\"#H20633523\" class=\"local\">'Live viral vaccines'</a> below.) </p><p>Children with IBD should undergo routine childhood vaccines with the following special considerations:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20633875\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of titers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest measurement of titers for measles and testing for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody (HBsAg and HBsAb), regardless of the immunization history, and documentation of immunity to varicella. Patients with nonprotective titers should be re-immunized, but with special considerations for live viral vaccines as outlined below. For patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (eg, HBsAg+, HBsAb-), immunosuppressive treatment may reactivate the HBV disease. Treatment options for these patients are discussed separately.

Case series suggest that 25 to 40 percent of pediatric patients with IBD display elements of clinical depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Other reported problems include excessive absenteeism and reduced school functioning, teasing by classmates, embarrassment during athletic activities, sleep disturbance and increased fatigue, and delayed psychosocial development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,42-45</a>]. Triggers for these problems may include physical differences from their peers including short stature or pubertal delay, altered bowel patterns, and increased toileting needs, or the presence of ostomies, surgical scars, or nasogastric tubes. In addition, children and their families may feel burdened by the scope of requisite medical care, including frequent medication administration (up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">pills/day</span> for some regimens) and office visits. Conflicts may arise between patients and their parents over appetite and eating, especially if the parents do not recognize that the disease can cause a child's anorexia. Finally, children and their parents may develop a fear of the future, particularly for patients with severe disease.</p><p>Depression in children with IBD is correlated with disease activity, psychosocial factors, and socioeconomic stressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. While underlying emotional vulnerability may be unmasked by the psychosocial stressors outlined above, it is also possible that depression may be exacerbated by the inflammatory process itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

Anxiety or depression may affect a child's perception of abdominal pain, leading to either under-reporting or over-reporting of their symptoms, and this can interfere with clinical monitoring of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Moreover, the burden of medication and medical care may lead to &quot;medication fatigue&quot; and nonadherence to the regimen.</p><p>The effects of IBD extend beyond the child and can have a significant impact on their family's level of emotional stress and quality of life. One study of families with adolescent children with IBD found that the adolescent's depressive symptoms had an important impact on the parent's level of distress, independent of disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

However, because of the rarity of these tumors, the number of patients with CD experiencing this complication remains small. Patients with IBD have an increased risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), which may be most closely related to the use of thiopurines. IBD also is associated with an increased risk for melanoma, and the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors also contribute to this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/38,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,63</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H20631804\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring nutritional status'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunization status should be assessed prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive medications (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">infliximab</a> and other anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] antibodies). This should include the following steps:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluate for tuberculosis (TB) risk factors and test for latent TB infection with a Mantoux (PPD) skin test or interferon-gamma release assay. (See <a href=\"#H20631828\" class=\"local\">'Infection risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Measure measles titers, test for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody (HBsAg and HBsAb), and document immunity to varicella, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108934\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108934 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20633875\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of titers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If immunization for varicella or measles is needed, this should be given at least four weeks prior to beginning immunosuppressive therapy, if possible, because these are live viral vaccines. In general, live viral vaccines should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients with high-level immunosuppression. The immunization strategy for these diseases requires special considerations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91884 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20633523\" class=\"local\">'Live viral vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (eg, HBsAg+, Ag-), immunosuppressive treatment may reactivate the HBV disease. (See <a href=\"#H20633875\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of titers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Review the immunization history and administer all routine <strong>inactivated</strong> vaccines as needed, including influenza, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus (HPV), and pneumococcus. Whenever possible, it is preferable to administer any needed catch-up or re-immunizations prior to initiation of immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H20633581\" class=\"local\">'Routine inactivated vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administer the 23-valent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV23) in addition to the standard pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). This is because immunosuppressed patients are considered at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. (See <a href=\"#H20633592\" class=\"local\">'Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screen for episcleritis and uveitis as part of routine care, by inquiring about eye symptoms and examining the sclerae for injection and nodules. Referral for a full ophthalmologic examination is recommended for patients with symptoms or findings suggestive of episcleritis or uveitis, and for patients on prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids. Periodic ophthalmologic examinations, approximately every one to two years, are also advisable for asymptomatic patients. (See <a href=\"#H20631840\" class=\"local\">'Eye examinations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquire about depressive symptoms and anxiety, excessive absenteeism and school functioning, sleep disturbance, and family conflict, as part of routine care, and refer for psychological counseling and support as needed. These issues have important effects on the quality of life for patient and family, and also can interfere with disease management. (See <a href=\"#H20631846\" class=\"local\">'Psychological support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or extensive Crohn colitis should begin surveillance colonoscopy for cancer screening about 7 to 10 years after the diagnosis of IBD. Individuals who develop primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) should begin annual screening for colorectal cancer as soon as the PSC is diagnosed. (See <a href=\"#H20631858\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance for cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/important-health-maintenance-issues-for-children-and-adolescents-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Heuschkel R, Salvestrini C, Beattie RM, et al.
