Most doctors recommend that you use one right away when you have an allergic reaction and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing or feel like your throat is tight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel dizzy or like you are going to pass out</p><p/><p>If your doctor prescribed an autoinjector for your child, use it right away when your child has an allergic reaction and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seems groggy or passes out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomits a lot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughs a lot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has hives all over his or her body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20996336\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use an epinephrine autoinjector?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your autoinjector will have directions that come with it. In general, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the autoinjector out of its case</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the autoinjector in your hand, making sure your fingers aren't over either end</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take off the safety cap or caps</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you're giving the injection to a child or someone who might have trouble staying still, hold their leg so they can't move</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press the tip firmly into the outer thigh &ndash; The needle in the autoinjector can go through clothes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75436\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75436 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold it in place for at least 2 to 3 seconds</p><p/><p>After you use an autoinjector, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> or go to the hospital, because your symptoms can come back as the medicine wears off. In the hospital, doctors can give you other medicines and make sure that your symptoms don't return.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20996343\"><span class=\"h1\">What if the autoinjector doesn't stop my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medicine in the autoinjector should stop your symptoms within a few minutes. But if your symptoms don't improve, get worse, or return before you reach the hospital, you will need another dose.</p><p>Some autoinjectors have 2 doses of medicine in them, but others have only 1 dose. If your autoinjector has only 1 dose of medicine, you will need to use a second autoinjector.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20996350\"><span class=\"h1\">Where should I keep my autoinjector?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keep your autoinjector at room temperature &ndash; and not in places that get too hot or cold.</p><p>You should carry at least 1 autoinjector with you at all times, because you never know when you'll need it. Let your family members know where you keep your autoinjector. That way, if you have an allergic reaction but can't get your autoinjector, another person can get it and use it on you.</p><p>If your child has an autoinjector, be sure to bring it wherever he or she goes. You should also keep 1 at your child's school (if he or she goes to school).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20996357\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of epinephrine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Epinephrine</a> can cause short-term side effects, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast or pounding heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling nervous, shaky, or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290254515\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am worried about cost?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some brands of autoinjector can be expensive. The amount you will have to pay depends on where you live, which autoinjector you have, and your health insurance. If you are worried about the cost, talk to your doctor or nurse. You might be able to get a different type of autoinjector that is less expensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20996364\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peanut allergy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-treatment-and-prevention-of-recurrences-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis treatment and prevention of recurrences (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
