Reactions to these stressors can affect individuals in a number of domains: Physiologic, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral. </p><p>Combat and operational stress reaction (COSR; or combat stress injury) is a term used to describe the wide range of anticipated, maladaptive psychological and behavioral symptoms, often transient, that may emerge in response to these stressors following exposure to combat or other particularly stressful military operations. </p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of COSR are described here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of psychiatric disorders related to stressful experiences, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other psychological sequelae of military combat are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H17512983\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>The effects of battlefield stress on military personnel have been recognized throughout the history of warfare. Older terms to describe the syndrome include &ldquo;shell shock&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combat-and-operational-stress-reaction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], &ldquo;soldier&rsquo;s heart&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combat-and-operational-stress-reaction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], &ldquo;battle fatigue&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combat-and-operational-stress-reaction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and &ldquo;psychoneuroses&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combat-and-operational-stress-reaction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

COSR differs from a psychiatric disorder in several ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A psychiatric disorder is diagnosed using criteria that specify the signs, symptoms, behaviors, and levels of impairment that must be present to make a diagnosis; there is no threshold number or severity of symptoms that establish the presence of COSR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The United States Army does <strong>not</strong> consider COSR to be a psychiatric or medically diagnosable condition.
