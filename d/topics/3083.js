This corresponds to a height that is below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile. Short stature may be either a variant of normal growth or caused by a disease.</p><p>The most common causes of short stature beyond the first year or two of life are familial (genetic) short stature and delayed (constitutional) growth, which are normal non-pathologic variants of growth. The goal of the evaluation of a child with short stature is to identify the subset of children with pathologic causes (such as Turner syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or other underlying systemic disease, or growth hormone deficiency). The evaluation also assesses the severity of the short stature and likely growth trajectory, to facilitate decisions about intervention, if appropriate. </p><p>This topic will review the main causes of short stature. The diagnostic approach to children with short stature is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396642107\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY OF LINEAR GROWTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emerging evidence reveals that normal and pathologic variations in linear growth depend on the balance between proliferation and senescence of chondrocytes at the growth plate. This process is regulated by many systems, including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine mechanisms &ndash; Growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), androgens, and thyroid hormone all stimulate chondrogenesis, while glucocorticoids inhibit chondrogenesis. Estrogens promote linear growth by stimulating growth hormone and IGF-I secretion, but also accelerate chondrocyte senescence, leading to fusion of the growth plates and cessation of linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proinflammatory cytokines &ndash; Some cytokines negatively regulate growth plate function. These are elevated in chronic inflammatory diseases, in which they slow linear growth and also growth plate senescence, which permits catch-up growth after the cytokine effect resolves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paracrine mechanisms &ndash; Including fibroblast growth factors, bone morphogenetic proteins, parathyroid hormone-related protein, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cartilage extracellular matrix &ndash; Includes collagens, proteoglycans, and other proteins. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracellular pathways &ndash; Chondrocyte transcription factors including SHOX, several SOX genes, and the MAPK signaling pathway. (See <a href=\"#H297545835\" class=\"local\">'SHOX mutations'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>Together, these effects on the growth plate explain the variations in linear growth observed clinically in health and disease, including normal growth and the pubertal growth spurt, normal variation in height, and &quot;idiopathic&quot; short stature due to polymorphisms in these or other genes (see <a href=\"#H297546528\" class=\"local\">'Normal variants of growth'</a> below), and growth delay due to malnutrition, inflammatory disease, or glucocorticoid exposure (see <a href=\"#H23777589\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic causes of growth failure'</a> below), as well as severe growth failure seen in a variety of skeletal dysplasias (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Specific disorders&quot;</a>). In some cases, loss-of-function mutations in a gene are associated with short stature, while gain-of-function variants in the same gene are associated with tall stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>In the clinical setting, these observations explain why growth hormone has variable effects on growth in children with short stature. Growth hormone is highly effective in individuals with growth hormone deficiency, but may also have nonspecific stimulatory effects on the growth plate that can partially compensate for growth problems due to some other molecular defects. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297546528\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL VARIANTS OF GROWTH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297546569\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial short stature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial or genetic short stature is most often a normal variant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80244 \">figure 1</a>). These individuals usually have low-normal height velocity throughout life. The otherwise normal height velocity generally distinguishes these children from those with pathologic causes of short stature. Their bone age is consistent with their chronological age, which helps distinguish them from children with constitutional delay of growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51582\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51582 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H297546694\" class=\"local\">'Constitutional delay of growth and puberty'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297546694\"><span class=\"h2\">Constitutional delay of growth and puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP, sometimes called constitutional short stature for prepubertal children) results in childhood short stature but relatively normal adult height. Children with CDGP are usually of normal size at birth. However, a downward shift in growth rate begins at three to six months of age that is parallel to that seen in most normally growing children in this age group, but tends to be more severe and prolonged. By three or four years of age, children with CDGP usually are growing at a low-normal rate (eg, about 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> in preadolescent girls, and 3.5 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> in preadolescent boys). The result is a growth curve that remains below, but parallel to, the third percentile for height. In addition to a low preadolescent height velocity, they tend to have delayed pubertal development. This leads to a marked height discrepancy during the early teenage years compared with their peers, but is followed by catch-up growth when they do enter puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94472 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The hallmark of CDGP is delayed skeletal age; it is more closely related to the height age (age at which one's height would be average) than the chronologic age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51582\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51582 \">table 1</a>). For these patients, height data should be interpreted according to bone age rather than chronological age to accurately reflect height potential. Because the bone age is delayed, growth typically continues longer than normal, often resulting in adult stature within the normal range. In many cases, there is a family history of delayed growth and puberty in one or both parents (sometimes described as being a &quot;late bloomer&quot;). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153865484\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic short stature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A practical definition of idiopathic short stature (ISS) is a height below 2 standard deviations (SD) of the mean for age, in the absence of any endocrine, metabolic, or other diagnosis. These children have normal (often at the lower limit) height velocity and no biochemical or other evidence for a specific growth retarding condition, which implies normal results for endocrine screening tests, including those for growth hormone deficiency. Genome-wide studies indicate that the majority of the variation in adult height is explained by several hundred genetic variations, each with a small effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in a small proportion of the population, short stature is caused by specific genetic variations with large effect. As an example, emerging evidence suggests that mutations in the <strong>S</strong>hort Stature <strong>HO</strong>meobo<strong>X</strong> (SHOX) gene are responsible for 1 to 4 percent of individuals who would otherwise have been classified as having &quot;idiopathic&quot; short stature (see <a href=\"#H297545835\" class=\"local\">'SHOX mutations'</a> below). In addition to these genetic contributors to ISS, it appears that <strong>epigenetic</strong> changes may play a role in some cases of ISS. In one study, ISS was associated with increased methylation of two promoter regions for the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) gene; these epigenetic changes are predicted to reduce the individual's sensitivity to growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes#H451437291\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone insensitivity syndromes&quot;, section on 'Impaired IGF-I promoter function'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Growth hormone therapy is approved in the United States for children with ISS, which is defined for this purpose by a more stringent threshold for height (below -2.25 SD of the mean, and a predicted adult height is &lt;63 inches [160 cm] for males and &lt;59 inches [150 cm] for girls). However, the use of growth hormone for this group of patients remains controversial. Studies have shown that consumer preferences (family concern) and physician attitudes are important drivers of treatment decisions, independent of patient characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Treatment indications and efficacy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone treatment for idiopathic short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ISS is a diagnosis of exclusion. The child's height percentile is below the range predicted by the mid-parental height and the bone age is not delayed, but there is no evidence of underlying genetic, systemic, or endocrine disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although this may be a variant of normal growth, patients with this growth pattern warrant monitoring for the possibility of unrecognized underlying disease. </p><p>There is ongoing controversy about the nomenclature of ISS. Here, we use the term to refer to non-familial cases (ie, those without patterns of familial short stature). Others consider familial short stature and CDGP to be subcategories of ISS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297546960\"><span class=\"h2\">Small for gestational age infants with catch-up growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most infants born small for gestational age (SGA) experience catch-up growth by two years of age, sufficient to be within the normal range (length above -2 SD, ie, &gt;2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile). Catch-up growth may be delayed in infants who are born preterm in addition to SGA, but often continues into childhood to approach the range predicted by the family's height. SGA can be caused by maternal, placental, or fetal factors. In many cases these factors (such as intrauterine constraint from a small uterus) are transient and are followed by vigorous catch-up growth during infancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-fetal-intrauterine-growth-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>About 10 percent of SGA infants, particularly those born with more severe SGA, do not experience catch-up growth to reach the normal range by two years of age. This group of SGA infants can be considered to have a pathologic pattern of growth, so they are discussed later in this topic review. (See <a href=\"#H543524820\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of short stature that may be pathologic'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23777589\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC CAUSES OF GROWTH FAILURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic disorders with secondary effects on growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost any serious disease can cause growth failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94176\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94176 \">table 2</a>). The abnormalities of growth and development that occur in children with acute or chronic illnesses may result from the primary disease process because of increased energy needs or nutritional deprivation (eg, decreased intake or malabsorption). Growth also may be affected by treatments, such as radiation therapy (a permanent effect), glucocorticoids, stimulants used for attention deficit disorder (ADD), or chemotherapy (mostly transient effects, but may have a small permanent effect if treatment is prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]). Some diseases may cause secondary derangements of the hormones that affect growth.</p><p>Diseases or processes that are particularly important causes of growth failure are outlined below. Other disorders that can cause growth failure with weight loss are outlined in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents#H5454730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of weight loss in infants over six months of age, children, and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297546998\"><span class=\"h3\">Undernutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insufficient nutrition tends to lead to short stature with a delayed pattern of growth. Under-nutrition can be isolated (eg, caused by inadequate food supply or self-imposed restriction, such as fear of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]), or it may be a component of an underlying systemic disease that interferes with food intake or absorption, or increases energy needs. The hallmark of under-nutrition is low weight-for-height. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543524649\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since glucocorticoids are used for treatment of a variety of diseases, they are a common cause of growth failure in children. The growth failure can develop with or without other symptoms of glucocorticoid excess, known as Cushing syndrome (see <a href=\"#H663909523\" class=\"local\">'Cushing syndrome'</a> below). They suppress growth through several different mechanisms, including interference with endogenous growth hormone secretion and action, bone formation, nitrogen retention, and collagen formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The growth effects of glucocorticoids are related to the type, dose, and duration of the exposure. If glucocorticoids are discontinued, children usually experience some catch-up growth. </p><p>The relative effects of different glucocorticoids on growth are similar, but not identical, to the relative potencies for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Growth impairment is more pronounced with agents with a longer duration of action (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> &gt; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> &gt; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>). It is most pronounced when glucocorticoids are administered daily as compared with an alternate-day regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Some inhibition of linear growth occurs even at the doses that are used for physiological replacement (ie, prednisone doses of 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day; approximately 0.075 to 0.125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day), and progressive growth impairment is seen with increasing doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As an example, in a large series of children with growth failure due to chronic treatment with glucocorticoids for a systemic disease, the mean prednisone-equivalent dose was 0.5 &plusmn; 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Growth impairment can even occur with prolonged administration of inhaled glucocorticoids during childhood, although the overall effect of these agents on adult height appears to be small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Dose'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Growth deceleration'</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged treatment with systemic glucocorticoids may have persistent effects on growth after therapy is discontinued. In a study of 224 children with cystic fibrosis who previously had been treated for up to four years with either alternate-day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or placebo, mean height after age 18 years (on average six to seven years after cessation of therapy) was significantly lower in boys who had received either high- or low-dose prednisone (170.5 and 170.7 versus 174.6 cm with placebo; p = 0.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This effect was most pronounced in boys who had started taking prednisone at six to eight years of age. In contrast, there was no persistent growth impairment in girls treated similarly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64003660\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with growth failure resulting from gastrointestinal disease tend to have a greater deficit in weight than height (ie, they are underweight-for-height) in contrast to those with endocrine disorders, who are often overweight-for-height (see below). </p><p>About 30 percent of children with Crohn disease have a decrease in height velocity before the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and about 10 percent of children with Crohn disease have short stature when the Crohn disease is diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The growth failure is closely related to the inflammatory disease process (mediated by proinflammatory cytokines), as well as decreased food intake, malabsorption, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high-dose glucocorticoids if used for treatment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>). Similarly, celiac disease can present with growth failure, especially in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Both of these disorders are important considerations in the evaluation of a child whose linear growth has slowed, particularly if there are gastrointestinal symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> slow weight gain.

This may be a consequence of the proinflammatory cytokines associated with disease activity and is also caused by the high-dose glucocorticoids that are often used for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Common presenting symptoms in JIA are fever, arthralgias, rash, and lymphadenopathy, in addition to growth failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications#H401617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications&quot;, section on 'Growth retardation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth failure is seen in at least one-third of children with chronic kidney disease. The primary causes of growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease are disturbances of growth hormone metabolism and its main mediator, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Other factors may include metabolic acidosis, uremia, poor nutrition secondary to dietary restrictions, anorexia of chronic illness, anemia, calcium and phosphorus imbalance, renal osteodystrophy, or use of high-dose glucocorticoids if used for treatment. Affected patients are candidates for growth hormone therapy until renal transplantation, and some of these patients may also benefit from growth hormone therapy after transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-growth-impairment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, evaluation and diagnosis of growth impairment in children with chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-postrenal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone treatment in children with chronic kidney disease and postrenal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Metabolic acidosis alone can also impair growth, as occurs in children with renal tubular acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Alkali therapy may lead to attainment and maintenance of normal stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

After diagnosis, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy also can contribute to impaired growth. These effects often subside within one to two years of initiating treatment, and some children then have catch-up growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Late growth failure is common in children who received cranial radiotherapy because it can damage the hypothalamus and cause insufficiency of one or more hormones from the pituitary, including growth hormone, gonadotropins, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]. In younger children, especially girls, cranial radiotherapy can cause precocious puberty and adult short stature. Primary hypothyroidism also can occur if the thyroid gland was in the radiation field. Spinal irradiation may result in slow growth of the spine with relative preservation of normal limb growth.

Among acquired metabolic diseases, the most common is type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the past, type 1 diabetes mellitus was an important cause of short stature and attenuated growth because of caloric deficit resulting from severe glucosuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, it is now rare because of improvements in therapy. Children with type 1 diabetes have some decrease in IGF-I production or action, and there is a negative correlation between hemoglobin A1C (as an index of metabolic control) and adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Nonetheless, in children with fair to good metabolic control, growth and adult height are usually within normal ranges. Occasionally, children with diabetes and very poor glycemic control develop Mauriac syndrome, characterized by attenuated linear growth, delayed puberty, hepatomegaly, and Cushingoid features.

In general, these disorders are characterized by excessive weight for height. They should be considered in any child with markedly reduced height velocity, and especially in those with other pituitary disorders, brain tumors, septo-optic dysplasia (also known as optic nerve hypoplasia), midline brain and facial defects, neonatal hypoglycemia, history of cranial irradiation, or a familial pattern of growth hormone deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The syndrome also may be caused by an adrenal adenoma, especially in younger children.

Other key clinical features are central obesity, suprascapular fat pad (&quot;buffalo hump&quot;), abdominal striae, hirsutism, acne, and neuropsychological symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The best tests to establish the diagnosis are a 24-hour urine collection for free cortisol (and creatinine), or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression test. Measurements of serum cortisol are not reliable screening tests, unless performed late at night.

The bone age is usually delayed; as a result, many children with hypothyroidism have a reasonably normal growth potential once the disorder is identified and treated. The evaluation should include measurements of both TSH and free thyroxine to allow detection of both primary and central hypothyroidism. Measurement of serum TSH alone will not detect central hypothyroidism as it can be low, normal, or even slightly elevated.

It can also be caused by sellar and parasellar tumors (eg, craniopharyngioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]) that destroy the pituitary gland itself, in which case there may be deficiencies of multiple hormones produced by the anterior pituitary (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>). Children with growth hormone deficiency can have striking catch-up growth during growth hormone replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Children with a sellar or parasellar tumor that causes growth hormone deficiency occasionally experience rapid catch-up growth after surgical resection of the tumor without growth hormone treatment; this phenomenon is known as &quot;growth without growth hormone&quot; and is not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. A rare cause of growth hormone deficiency is an inactivating mutation of the GHRH receptor that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>If growth hormone deficiency is congenital and complete, the diagnosis is relatively easy to confirm. Affected children present with severe postnatal growth failure, delayed bone age, and very low serum concentrations of growth hormone, IGF-I, and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3, the major circulating binding protein for IGF-I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Additional findings are hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, and micropenis, especially if gonadotropins are deficient as well. </p><p>In children with less severe growth failure, whose height may still be within the normal range for age, the decision to undertake detailed testing should be based on strict auxological criteria. It is therefore mandatory to obtain accurate serial measurements of height. Any evidence of central nervous system disease or other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies should lead to measurement of IGF-I and provocative testing of growth hormone (growth hormone stimulation tests). These provocative tests are not definitive but can be a valuable diagnostic tool when combined with auxological and bone age data and measurements of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Congenital growth hormone insensitivity is a very rare disorder characterized by high serum growth hormone concentrations with low serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In its complete form, this condition is called Laron-type dwarfism (complete growth hormone insensitivity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

One is sexual precocity. The other is accelerated epiphyseal development, which causes rapid childhood growth but more rapid advancement of bone age. As a result, height age is advanced compared with chronologic age, but it lags behind the markedly accelerated bone age. If their growth is not halted, these tall children will be short adults because early epiphyseal closure stops linear growth prematurely. </p><p>There are two types of sexual precocity: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (GDPP), also known as central (or true) precocious puberty, refers to the early occurrence of normal puberty. Precocious puberty historically had been defined as sexual development in girls before the age of eight years and in boys before the age of nine years; however, data for girls, particularly black girls, indicate that the age of onset of normal puberty is younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. The hallmarks of precocious puberty are accelerated growth and advanced bone age, plus breast development in girls and penile enlargement and sexual hair growth in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The clinical manifestations are similar to those of GDPP, except that the sexual development may be that of the opposite sex, eg, androgen effects in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Virtually all girls with Turner syndrome have short stature, with an average adult height about 20 cm shorter than predicted by the mid-parental height. In addition, affected patients usually have absent or very delayed pubertal development and may have a square &quot;shield&quot; chest, webbed neck, cubitus valgus (increased carrying angle of the arm), genu valgum (inward tilting knees), shortened fourth metacarpals, and Madelung deformity of the forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94419 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94420 \">image 1</a>).

Of note, individuals with the hypomethylation defect tend to have inappropriately high levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3, suggesting a reduced sensitivity to IGF-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/98,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,107</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543524340\"><span class=\"h3\">Skeletal dysplasias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal dysplasias associated with short stature are caused by inherited defects in <span class=\"nowrap\">cartilage/bone</span> development and are often associated with disproportionate short stature (with limbs disproportionately short for the trunk, or vice versa). Some present prenatally and are detected on prenatal ultrasound, whereas others present during childhood with short stature. These disorders should be suspected in a child presenting with short stature and bone deformities, recurrent fractures, or abnormal findings on radiographs (eg, enchondromas, bowing or shortening of the long bones, vertebral defects, or rib abnormalities). </p><p>There are a variety of types, with very variable phenotypes, including achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, spondyloepiphysial dysplasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta. In one study, subtle skeletal dysplasias were found in 18.5 percent of patients previously labeled as either idiopathic short stature (ISS) or having been born small for gestational age (SGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-short-stature/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. The most common forms were dyschondrosteosis (due to <em>SHOX</em> mutations in 61.5 percent of those undergoing genetic testing) and hypochondroplasia (due to <em>FGFR</em> mutations in 25 percent of those subjects undergoing genetic testing). These disorders were especially prevalent among those with parents who are also very short. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Specific disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achondroplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achondroplasia&quot;</a>.) &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543524820\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of short stature that may be pathologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some individuals with apparent ISS may have underlying disorders that are pathologic but not diagnosed during a standard evaluation. If the short stature is severe, these patients warrant a detailed evaluation and ongoing monitoring for the possibility of subclinical underlying systemic disease. These patients also are candidates for growth hormone therapy. (See <a href=\"#H153865484\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic short stature'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone treatment for idiopathic short stature&quot;</a>.) </p><p>About 10 percent of infants born SGA fail to experience catch-up growth sufficient to be within the normal range by two years of age. This growth pattern is more likely in those with severe SGA and can be considered pathologic, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear and likely vary. Depending on the extent of their catch-up growth during childhood and adolescence, these children may also benefit from growth hormone therapy.

This translates to a height that is below the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> percentile. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most common causes of short stature are familial (genetic) short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), which are normal variants of growth. These growth patterns often can be distinguished from one another, but some children have features of both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51582\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51582 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H297546528\" class=\"local\">'Normal variants of growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost any serious systemic disease can cause growth failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94176\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94176 \">table 2</a>). Systemic disorders or processes that may present with growth failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed puberty include undernutrition, glucocorticoid therapy, gastrointestinal disease (especially Crohn disease and celiac disease), and renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Systemic disorders with secondary effects on growth'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of genetic syndromes and congenital malformations are associated with short stature. Turner syndrome is particularly important because shortness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> absent pubertal development may be the presenting feature, with or without other characteristic clinical features (see <a href=\"#H297546070\" class=\"local\">'Turner syndrome'</a> above). Most of these syndromes can be recognized by characteristic clinical features. These include Noonan, Silver-Russell, and Down syndromes.
