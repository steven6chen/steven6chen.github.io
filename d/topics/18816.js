However, the high incidence of treatment-related mortality has limited its use, and patient selection is thought to be a critical factor in determining successful outcomes. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) has published updated guidelines on pre-transplant screening and evaluation of patients in order to decrease the risk of transplant toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hematology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Gene therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cells is emerging as a possible alternative treatment. A study of 17 boys with early-stage cerebral ALD enrolled to undergo transplantation with autologous CD34+ cells transfected with Lenti-D (a lentiviral vector containing manufactured<em> ABCD1</em> complementary DNA) reported 88 percent were alive with no major functional disabilities at 24 months posttransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-hematology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One boy died from disease progression that began during pretransplantation conditioning, and one was withdrawn from the study and died from complications of subsequent allogeneic HCT. None of the survivors had evidence of graft failure or graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy may be as effective as, and safer than, HCT for treatment of early cerebral ALD. The treatment has not received regulatory approval. The clinical trial is ongoing and important uncertainties remain.
