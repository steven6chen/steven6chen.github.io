Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Tenosynovitis happens most often in the hand or wrist. But it can also happen in other parts of the body, such as the ankle.</p><p>Different things can cause tenosynovitis, but the 2 main causes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using the hand or wrist too much, or doing the same hand or wrist motion over and over</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections &ndash; Tenosynovitis that is caused by an infection can lead to serious problems. An infection can spread to and damage nearby tissues and muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14195876\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tenosynovitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of tenosynovitis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the fingers, hand, or wrist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the fingers or hand</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble grabbing or gripping objects</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14195891\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will examine your hand and fingers carefully and see how they move and work.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might do tests, depending on your symptoms and what's causing your tenosynovitis. Different tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test such as an X-ray, ultrasound, or MRI scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests &ndash; If you have an infection and a collection of pus around your tendon, the doctor will use a needle to remove some pus. Then he or she will send the sample to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14195906\"><span class=\"h1\">How is tenosynovitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what's causing your tenosynovitis and your symptoms.</p><p>Tenosynovitis that is caused by an infection is treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; During surgery, the doctor will drain the pus, wash out the area around the tendon, and cut away any dead tissue.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines</p><p/><p>Tenosynovitis that is caused by overuse of the hand or wrist is treated with one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest &ndash; You should rest your hand and avoid using it. Your doctor might recommend that you wear a brace or splint, or use &quot;buddy taping.&quot; Buddy taping is when you tape a finger to the finger next to it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82595 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the painful or swollen area every 4 to 6 hours, for 15 minutes each time. If you use ice on your finger, put a towel between the ice and your finger to avoid frostbite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-relieving medicines called &quot;NSAIDs&quot; &ndash; NSAIDs are a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finger stretches &ndash; After your symptoms improve, your doctor or nurse will show you stretches to help your fingers move more easily.</p><p/><p>If your symptoms don't get better or come back, your doctor might recommend:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a shot of a medicine called a steroid &ndash; Steroids help reduce inflammation. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to cut or loosen the covering around the tendon</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14195921\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hand-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hand pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-finger-injuries-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common finger injuries (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=de-quervain-tendinopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: de Quervain tendinopathy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
