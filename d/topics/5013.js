The neurologic assessment of neonates and adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-examination-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic examination of the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928921\"><span class=\"h1\">THE CASE HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The objectives of taking a clinical history are to establish rapport and trust with the child and family, to understand the nature of their health concerns regardless of whether or not they pertain to the nervous system, and to anatomically localize the neurologic symptoms. A skilled clinician is often able to arrive at a diagnosis by the time a complete history has been taken, and uses the examination to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928936\"><span class=\"h2\">History of present illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should document the duration of symptoms, whether they are constant or episodic (as in a transient ischemic attack, syncope, seizure, or migraine), and whether they are static, progressive, or resolving. In addition, the history may suggest localization to a specific anatomical region. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of the cerebral cortex should be suspected in patients with cognitive dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of the brainstem may be accompanied by double vision, dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness of voice, or impaired equilibrium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar disorders may be associated with altered equilibrium and coordination in the trunk or extremities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders of the spinal cord may result in dissociation of motor and sensory function below a certain altitudinal plane, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bowel and bladder dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders of the motor unit (anterior horn cells, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle) should be suspected in patients with weakness manifested by inability to climb stairs, raise the arms, grasp, stand, or walk.</p><p/><p>It is important to ask questions about whether, and to what extent, the neurologic disorder has impacted cognition, behavior, and language; the degree to which activities of daily living have been compromised; and what rehabilitative measures have been put in place. It is a common practice to inquire about activities a handicapped child cannot carry out. It is equally important to ask about activities the patient can do and enjoy because these skills can be targeted for further development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928944\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should note any current medications (and alternative medicines or nutritional supplements), with the form of the medication (capsule, tablet, suspension), strength in <span class=\"nowrap\">milligrams/grams,</span> frequency, and route of administration. In addition, the medications that the child has taken in the past, as well as the response to these medications, should be noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928952\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergy history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergies to medications and the nature of the allergic reaction should be recorded. This information may inform the choice of therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928960\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many childhood neurologic disorders are inherited. Thus, the clinician should inquire about the number of siblings, their gender and health, the age and health of the parents, and the family history of neurologic and systemic disorders and of consanguinity. If other family members have neurologic disease, a pedigree chart is often helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928968\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy, perinatal, and neonatal history</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prenatal history</strong> &ndash; The prenatal history should include the following elements:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mother's age at the time of pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of mother's previous pregnancies (gravida, para, miscarriages, and gestational age at the time of miscarriages)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prenatal exposure to prescription and illicit drugs, alcohol, radiation, and infections, and the fetus's gestational age at the time of exposure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Amount of maternal weight gain during the pregnancy (because excessive maternal weight gain may accompany preeclampsia and cause placental insufficiency; poor maternal weight gain may be associated with fetal growth restriction) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weight gain and loss in pregnancy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exposure to systemic illnesses or infections that could affect the developing fetal brain (eg, cytomegalovirus or Zika) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytomegalovirus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-zika-virus-infection-clinical-features-evaluation-and-management-of-the-neonate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital Zika virus infection: Clinical features, evaluation, and management of the neonate&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether fetal movements were reduced (as seen in infantile spinal muscular atrophy) or exaggerated (as seen in intrauterine seizures associated with pyridoxine dependency)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Results of prenatal head ultrasound studies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Labor and delivery</strong> &ndash; The labor and delivery history should include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gestational age at the time of onset of labor, and whether labor was spontaneous or induced</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fetal presentation, length of the labor, and whether vacuum or forceps extraction was used</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The infant's weight, length, and head circumference at birth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-routine-management-of-the-healthy-newborn-infant#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant&quot;, section on 'Apgar score'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether the infant needed resuscitation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whether the infant required neonatal intensive care, and if so, for how long and whether there were any complications, particularly if the infant required therapeutic hypothermia or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic hypothermia'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Newborn period</strong> &ndash; Significant events in the first week of life include the need for ventilatory support, oxygen administration, resuscitation, artificial hypothermia, exchange transfusion, status epilepticus, metabolic derangements, feeding difficulties, and coma. Impaired sucking or swallowing and sleep-wake difficulties in the first month of life are subtle markers of brain dysfunction.</p><p/><p>Many of the factors listed above are risk factors for cerebral palsy, which is discussed in greater detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928976\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should record the child's age at acquisition of developmental milestones, such as social smiling, developing adequate head control, gurgling, reaching out for objects, rolling over, being able to maintain a sitting position, coming to a sitting position independently, crawling, walking independently, babbling, and use of first words, phrases, and sentences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70142\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70142 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Some parents are unable to recall the exact age at which these milestones were achieved. They may, however, have a good recollection of events surrounding the child's first birthday; thus, one can help jog their memory by asking about the child's abilities at that time. The examiner should be aware that, in neurodegenerative disorders, a plateau in development may precede the start of developmental regression.</p><p>Early identification of children with autism spectrum disorders is accomplished through routine developmental surveillance at well-child visits, with additional developmental screening tests at specific visits, or when developmental concerns are raised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. &quot;&quot;This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10928984\"><span class=\"h2\">Review of other systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should inquire about underlying medical conditions, some of which may have neurologic symptoms. If any disorder is present, the clinician should document the symptoms, treatment, and status of these disorders (ie, resolving, static, or deteriorating).</p><p>Many regions require comprehensive newborn screening. An inquiry into the results of the newborn screen may be helpful. Although screening programs are designed for high sensitivity, false-negative results may occur, particularly in premature or medically complicated infants. Some forms of congenital hypothyroidism are not consistently captured by newborn screening, so testing should be repeated if there is a clinical suspicion for this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.)</p><p>Infants and children with cerebral palsy often have a variety of problems attributable to their neurologic dysfunction, including dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic constipation, respiratory difficulties, chronic aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree, sleep initiation and maintenance problems, impaired ambulation, scoliosis, deformities around joints of the extremities, and strabismus. In such children, the clinical history should include review of their current management.

In addition, assessment of age-appropriate milestones can help evaluate the higher cortical functions and yield clues to specific learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, and mild mental retardation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78835 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10929015\"><span class=\"h2\">Cranial nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each cranial nerve (CN) is tested by performance of a specific motor or sensory test.

Infant older than six months of age will usually reach for scraps of paper less than 5 mm in size when they are placed on a dark background. Standard tests can be used in older children who can recognize objects, letters, or numbers. The narrow, alternating black and white stripes painted onto a rotating drum should elicit optokinetic nystagmus, with quick jerks of the eyes in a direction opposite to the movement of the drum or tape.

The parent or caretaker can be requested to keep a bright object in the hand, upon which the child is asked to focus. The ability of the clinician to obtain an adequate funduscopic examination is often compromised by lack of patient cooperation, nystagmus, or small pupils. In this case, consultation should be sought with an ophthalmologist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The optic disc is normally pink in complexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53796\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53796 \">picture 1</a>).

Assessment of OKN can be performed using an OKN drum or a piece of paper or cloth with alternating black and white stripes that is rapidly moved across the patient's visual field at reading distance. As the stimulus is moved from left to right, normally sighted patients will show quick, jerky movements to the left side and vice versa. Alternatively, a mirror placed in front of the patient's eyes can be tilted in different directions to elicit ocular pursuit movements. OKN is dependent upon the integrity of the visual system, especially visual perception, and pursuit and saccadic eye movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Bilateral absence of OKN in infancy or early childhood may suggest blindness, while unilateral absence may suggest a hemispheric lesion. Normal OKN in an individual with a complaint of vision loss suggests hysterical blindness.

To test for rebound phenomenon, the patient flexes the arm against resistance offered by the examiner, then the examiner abruptly releases the resistance. In rebound phenomenon, the patient is unable to stop the muscle contraction.</p><p>Dysmetria can be assessed with finger to nose test: when seated with the elbows fully extended and the arms in a horizontal plane, the patient is asked to touch the index finger to his nose and then return to the starting position.

The joint under consideration should be at approximately 90 degrees and fully relaxed. In patients with cerebral palsy, exhortations to &quot;relax&quot; may paradoxically increase contraction of the muscles, and should thus be avoided. Instead, the patient should be put at ease during reflex testing with conversation.</p><p>To elicit the reflex, let the head of the reflex drop onto the tendon at the following locations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaw &ndash; with the mouth held partially open and examiner's finger placed over the chin, the finger is lightly tapped with a reflex hammer to displace the mandible downwards. This elicits contraction of the mandible and slight closure of the mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biceps &ndash; just anterior to the elbow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triceps &ndash; just posterior to the elbow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brachioradialis &ndash; just above the wrist, on the radial aspect of the forearm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee (patellar) &ndash; just below the patella.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ankle (Achilles) &ndash; just behind the ankle.</p><p/><p>The elicitation of tendon reflexes provides information about multiple aspects of the nervous system. Findings can be interpreted as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent or diminished tendon reflexes &ndash; this generally indicates interruption of the muscle stretch reflex arc at the level. Since the afferent impulses generated after tapping a tendon with reflex hammer are carried via large diameter fibers, the absence of a tendon reflex could also signify involvement of large diameter sensory fibers in a peripheral nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exaggerated tendon reflexes &ndash; this generally indicates disinhibition of the motor units owing to a pyramidal tract lesion. When the patellar reflex is elicited, spread to the opposite side in the form of a crossed adductor response (contraction of the contralateral hip muscle), or contraction of the plantar flexures of the foot are considered exaggerated and abnormal. Similarly, clonus (rhythmic muscle contractions elicited by the stimulus) is exaggerated and abnormal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric tendon reflexes &ndash; this may indicate a cerebral hemispheric lesion. Asymmetry is most easily detected with a gentle stimulus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences between tendon reflexes in the upper and lower body &ndash; this may suggest a spinal cord lesion. As an example, the jaw jerk is the only tendon reflex that is mediated above the plane of the foramen magnum; thus, if the jaw jerk is of normal amplitude but the biceps and other tendon reflexes are exaggerated, this might be a clue to a cranio-vertebral junction lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10929149\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental reflexes (also known as primitive reflexes) appear at a certain time during the course of brain development, and normally disappear with progressive maturation of cortical inhibitory functions.
