The spectrum of clinical manifestations of psoriasis is wide, and includes chronic plaque, guttate, inverse, erythrodermic, pustular, and nail variants of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with guttate psoriasis typically present with the acute onset of numerous small, inflammatory, scaly plaques on the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55141%7EDERM%2F64836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55141 graphicRef64836 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Guttate psoriasis is most common among children and young adults, and a preceding history of streptococcal infection is often present. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of guttate psoriasis will be reviewed here.

Estimates of the proportion of patients with psoriasis who develop guttate disease vary widely; many studies cite a prevalence of less than 30 percent among patients with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Guttate psoriasis is most frequently diagnosed in children and young adults under the age of 30; however, older individuals may also be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. As an example, in a Spanish study that compared 1092 patients in whom psoriasis began between the ages of 0 and 30 years to 662 patients with disease onset later in life, patients in the younger-onset group were significantly more likely to have the guttate variant (15 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>A sex predilection for guttate psoriasis has not been established.

The class I human leukocyte antigen HLA-Cw6 (in particular, the HLA Cw*0602 allele) and beta-hemolytic streptococci are the primary factors linked to the development of this disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500143\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HLA-Cw*0602 allele is strongly associated with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 18 studies with approximately 3400 patients with psoriasis and 3300 healthy controls, participants who were positive for HLA-Cw*0602 were more than four times more likely to have psoriasis than participants who were negative for the allele (OR 4.55, 95% CI 3.65-5.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The association between psoriasis and the HLA-Cw*0602 allele appears to be particularly strong among patients with guttate psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/5,12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12-16</a>]. Examples of studies in support of an association include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an Icelandic study that evaluated the correlation between HLA-Cw6 status and disease characteristics in patients with familial psoriasis, 31 of 33 patients (94 percent) whose symptoms began as an acute guttate eruption demonstrated HLA-Cw6 positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An extension of this study that included patients without a family history of psoriasis (n = 1019) found the prevalence of guttate disease was significantly greater among HLA-Cw*0602 positive patients than among HLA-Cw*0602 negative patients (11 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Swedish case-control study, 56 of 77 patients with guttate psoriasis (73 percent) were positive for the HLA-Cw*0602 allele compared with 39 or 371 controls (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a United Kingdom study of 29 patients with guttate psoriasis and 604 controls, the HLA-Cw*0602 allele was detected in all patients with guttate psoriasis compared with only 20 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Chinese study found that HLA-Cw*0602 was strongly associated with guttate psoriasis; the guttate presentation accounted for 21 percent of psoriasis cases in HLA-Cw*0602 positive patients with psoriasis and 9 percent of psoriasis cases in HLA-Cw*0602 negative patients with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500010\"><span class=\"h2\">Streptococcal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Streptococcal infection often precedes the onset of guttate psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/7,17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17-21</a>]. A link between these entities is supported by studies that have documented a relationship between new-onset guttate psoriasis and acute streptococcal pharyngitis in 56 to 97 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, perianal streptococcal infection has preceded guttate psoriasis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The cutaneous manifestations of guttate psoriasis typically develop two to three weeks after an associated streptococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>New-onset guttate psoriasis may be more likely to be associated with streptococcal infections than guttate psoriasis that develops in patients with preexisting chronic plaque psoriasis. In a prospective study, 19 of 33 patients (58 percent) with acute guttate psoriasis versus 7 of 27 patients (26 percent) with guttate exacerbations of chronic psoriasis had serologic evidence for recent streptococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500017\"><span class=\"h2\">Other infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports have documented the development of guttate psoriasis following varicella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and <em>Pityrosporum</em> folliculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. A Koebner phenomenon, in which wound healing triggers hyperproliferative changes in the skin, may be a factor in these cases. Guttate psoriasis has also developed in the site of a tattoo, a finding consistent with the theory of Koebnerization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500846\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guttate psoriasis has been reported after treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors in case reports and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. The reason for this paradoxical observation is unclear, but may involve disruption of the cytokine milieu, leading to unopposed interferon production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1391875265\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of guttate psoriasis is not well-understood. Interplay between genetic and environmental factors leading to an aberrant immune response in the skin may contribute to disease development.</p><p>As noted above, strong associations between guttate psoriasis, streptococcal infection, and HLA-Cw*0602 positivity have been detected in patients with guttate psoriasis (see <a href=\"#H2500968\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above). Examples of proposed mechanisms for the relationship between guttate psoriasis and streptococcal infection include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cross-reactivity between streptococcal M-proteins (the major pathogenic antigens on beta-hemolytic streptococci) presented to immune cells in the tonsils and structurally similar type I keratins in the epidermis (K16 and K17) trigger a T-cell mediated autoimmune response</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Streptococcal superantigens in the tonsils may augment the expression of the skin homing cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) on effector T cells, contributing to the migration of T cells into the skin; CD4+ cells migrate into the dermis and CD8+ cells migrate into the epidermis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An innate immune-mediated inflammatory response occurs as a consequence of the binding of peptidoglycan or other streptococcal antigens to cell receptors </p><p/><p>The observed association between guttate psoriasis and HLA-Cw*0602 may be related to interactions between streptococci and this molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In an in vitro study, homologous peptides from K17 and streptococcal M-protein that were predicted to bind to HLA-Cw6 were better able to stimulate IFN-gamma production in T cells (mostly CD8+ T cells that also demonstrated CLA) from patients with psoriasis than T cells obtained from patients without psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Moreover, the greatest responses were detected in T cells derived from HLA-Cw*0602 positive patients with psoriasis. </p><p>Clinical evidence of a relationship between HLA-Cw*0602 status, guttate psoriasis, and streptococcal infection was detected in a study of 439 patients with plaque psoriasis, 143 patients with guttate psoriasis, and 454 healthy controls. Patients with guttate psoriasis who were positive for HLA-Cw*0602 were more likely to have a positive streptococcal throat swab than patients who were HLA-Cw*0602 negative (odds ratio 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-8.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A difference in throat swab positivity rates based upon HLA-Cw*0602 status was not detected among the healthy controls. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2499966\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guttate psoriasis is characterized by the acute eruption of numerous small, erythematous papules and plaques. The term &ldquo;guttate&rdquo; is utilized to refer to the discrete, drop-like appearance of skin lesions. The eruption may present as a new onset disorder in patients without a history of psoriasis or as a new presentation of psoriasis in patients with preexisting chronic plaque-type disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Individual lesions usually measure between 2 and 15 mm in diameter and demonstrate fine overlying scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55141%7EDERM%2F64836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55141 graphicRef64836 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The trunk and proximal extremities are classically involved, although lesions may also occur in other sites, such as the scalp, hands, feet, and nails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Pruritus and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1391875279\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical examination is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of guttate psoriasis. A skin biopsy can be used to support the diagnosis in difficult cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500097\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histopathologic findings of guttate psoriasis vary with the age of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The findings in early lesions may be nondiagnostic, demonstrating mild acanthosis, papillary dermal edema, capillary dilatation, and a sparse lymphocyte-predominant dermal infiltrate. </p><p>Mature lesions more closely resemble the pathology findings in chronic plaque psoriasis. Such lesions have parakeratosis alternating with hyperkeratosis, epidermal acanthosis, rete ridge elongation, and collections of neutrophils in the epidermis that are also known as Munro microabscesses. Dermal findings include dilated, tortuous vessels and a superficial perivascular infiltrate containing lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500854\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No serologic tests provide a definitive diagnosis of guttate psoriasis. Routine assessment for evidence of a streptococcal infection in patients without infectious symptoms is controversial because a benefit of antibacterial therapy in guttate psoriasis is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In our opinion, laboratory testing is not necessary in patients without active signs or symptoms of streptococcal infection. </p><p>Patients who present with symptoms suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis or other forms of streptococcal infection should be evaluated with appropriate laboratory studies to facilitate the identification and treatment of these conditions. Symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, tonsillar exudate, tender cervical adenitis, and fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pharyngitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-a-streptococcal-tonsillopharyngitis-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500104\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple disorders may present with clinical features that resemble guttate psoriasis. In most cases, the clinical history and physical examination are sufficient for differentiating guttate psoriasis from other diseases. Occasionally, laboratory studies are needed to assist with diagnosis. </p><p>Examples of disorders in the differential diagnosis of guttate psoriasis include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pityriasis rosea </strong>&ndash; Pityriasis rosea presents with the acute eruption of multiple, oval inflammatory plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53701%7EDERM%2F57568%7EDERM%2F87126\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53701 graphicRef57568 graphicRef87126 \">picture 2A-C</a>). Like guttate psoriasis, the trunk and proximal extremities are prominent sites of involvement. The classic features of a &ldquo;Christmas tree&rdquo; pattern distribution and collarette of scale can be useful clues for the identification of pityriasis rosea. At least 50 percent also develop a large oval plaque (also known as a herald plaque) prior to the development of the widespread eruption.

Peripheral scale and central clearing are commonly seen. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is useful for diagnosis.

Involvement of the palms and soles suggests the possibility of this diagnosis. Serologic findings and histopathologic examination are also useful for diagnosis.

Few data are available on the prognosis of guttate psoriasis, precluding reliable predictions about the disease course in individual patients. </p><p>Disease remission was the most common course followed in a retrospective study of 36 patients with childhood or adult-onset guttate psoriasis who lacked a preceding history of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Complete remission lasting for at least one year occurred in 22 patients (61 percent) with a mean time to disease clearance of 3.9&plusmn;2.4 months, and the remaining 14 patients progressed to chronic plaque-type disease. Of note, three patients in the remission group had recurrence after one year. A wide variety of treatments for guttate psoriasis were utilized in the patients in this study.</p><p>Disease remission also was the most common course in a retrospective study of 79 patients with guttate psoriasis and no prior history of psoriasis who were followed for a least one year (median follow-up period of five years). In this study, 20 patients (25 percent) progressed to plaque psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The results of a molecular probe for streptococci appeared to correlate with risk for plaque psoriasis; however, additional data are necessary to confirm this finding. Among the 31 patients who had the molecular probe performed, none of the five patients who developed plaque psoriasis had a positive molecular probe for streptococci compared with 16 of 26 patients (62 percent) who did not develop plaque psoriasis. A similar correlation with antistreptolysin O titers was not detected. </p><p>Further study is necessary to determine whether a preceding history of guttate psoriasis is associated with greater severity of chronic plaque-type disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1391875286\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatments used for guttate psoriasis overlap with those utilized for chronic plaque psoriasis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given the possibility for spontaneous remission of guttate psoriasis within several weeks or several months, foregoing treatment is an option for patients who prefer to avoid therapy. However, since the time required for disease remittance is unpredictable and persistence of psoriasis is not uncommon, in our experience, many patients elect to proceed with treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2501744\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p>First-line treatments for guttate psoriasis include phototherapy and topical agents. Although systemic antibiotic therapy has been advocated by some authors, the value of such treatment is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, data on the efficacy of tonsillectomy, which aims to permanently remove a focus of streptococcal infection, are limited.

This designation is primarily due to its documented efficacy in other forms of psoriasis, its relative safety, and the ability to easily treat large body surface areas. The options for full-body phototherapy for psoriasis include narrowband UVB, broadband UVB, and psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) phototherapy. </p><p>The efficacy of phototherapy for plaque psoriasis is well documented, with narrowband UVB considered the preferred form of phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Narrowband UVB has been more effective than broadband UVB in multiple small, prospective split-body studies of patients with plaque-type psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>]. Although a randomized trial that compared narrowband UVB to a selective broadband UVB device in 100 patients with plaque-type psoriasis found a difference of efficacy in favor of narrowband UVB that was not statistically significant (56 versus 40 percent of patients achieved disease clearance), the study was underpowered to detect a difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. PUVA was significantly more effective than narrowband UVB in a randomized trial (n = 93). However, the requirement for strict photoprotection following treatment makes PUVA a less favorable choice for therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

An open study of 53 patients with various forms of psoriasis found that all patients with guttate psoriasis (n = 12) improved with narrowband UVB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guttate-psoriasis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Potential adverse effects of phototherapy include burns, pruritus, and premature skin aging.

Thus, phototherapy is usually preferred for the treatment of patients with numerous lesions. Topical agents may be used as an adjunct to phototherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2500111\" class=\"local\">'Phototherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Cutaneous atrophy is a potential adverse effect of topical corticosteroid therapy.

Medium to high potency agents may be applied to lesions on the trunk or extremities. </p><p>Topical corticosteroids are typically applied to active lesions once to twice daily for around two weeks.

Guttate psoriasis is most frequently diagnosed in adolescents and young adults, but may occur in other age groups. (See <a href=\"#H1391875258\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to the development of guttate psoriasis. The HLA-Cw*0602 allele has been strongly linked to this disorder and streptococcal infection often precedes its development. The latency period between streptococcal infection and the appearance of skin lesions is typically two to three weeks. (See <a href=\"#H2500968\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between streptococcal infection and guttate psoriasis is not fully understood. Cross-reactivity between streptococcal and epidermal antigens, stimulatory effects of streptococcal superantigens, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the induction of an innate immune response by streptococcal components may be involved. (See <a href=\"#H1391875265\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin lesions of guttate psoriasis are typically 2 to 15 mm in diameter with overlying fine scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55141%7EDERM%2F64836\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55141 graphicRef64836 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The trunk and proximal extremities are the principle sites of involvement. (See <a href=\"#H2499966\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of guttate psoriasis can usually be made by clinical examination. In difficult cases, a skin biopsy may be used to support the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. (See <a href=\"#H1391875279\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guttate psoriasis may spontaneously remit over the course of several weeks to months, or may persist and progress to chronic plaque disease. The course of the disease is unpredictable. (See <a href=\"#H2501744\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with widespread lesions of guttate psoriasis who desire treatment, we suggest treatment with narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogs, and other forms of phototherapy are alternative treatments. (See <a href=\"#H2500863\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with the systemic immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents utilized for plaque psoriasis may be attempted in patients with guttate psoriasis that fails to improve with phototherapy and topical therapies. The efficacy of such treatment in guttate psoriasis has not been well-studied. (See <a href=\"#H2502831\" class=\"local\">'Systemic psoriasis therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of tonsillectomy and systemic antibiotic therapy for the treatment of the skin manifestations of guttate psoriasis is controversial. Further study is necessary to explore the efficacy of these interventions. These interventions are not recommended for routine treatment of guttate psoriasis.
