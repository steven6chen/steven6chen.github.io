Screening provides benefit because removal of premalignant adenomas can prevent CRC and removal of localized cancer may prevent CRC-related death. CRC is infrequent before age 40; the incidence rises progressively thereafter to 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/1000</span> per year by age 80 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F111058\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111058 \">figure 1</a>). The lifetime incidence for patients at average risk in the United States is 4.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], with 90 percent of cases occurring after age 50.</p><p>Worldwide, CRC is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and third most common in men, accounting for over 694,000 deaths in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the United States, CRC is the second leading cause of cancer death and accounts for approximately 8.3 percent of cancer deaths overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately one in three people who develop CRC die of this disease.</p><p>Both the incidence of and mortality rates from CRC have been declining in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>], with death rates from CRC declining on average 2.7 percent each year between 2004 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One microsimulation model, MISCAN-Colon, suggests that screening may account for 53 percent of the observed reduction in CRC mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A study of temporal trends in CRC incidence and screening rates in the United States reported that approximately 250,000 to 500,000 CRC cases may have been prevented from 1987 to 2010, along with a shift from late- to early-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are many contributing factors to this changing epidemiology, including prevention of some cancers from detection and removal of adenomatous polyps during screening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Screening rates for CRC rose in the United States to over 60 percent and are reasonably stable, generally below national targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], with over 20 percent of CRC diagnosed when <span class=\"nowrap\">distant/metastasized</span>. Colonoscopy was the most commonly used screening test (nearly 61 percent).

Neoplastic changes result from both inherited and acquired genetic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The progression from adenoma to carcinoma, when it occurs, apparently takes at least 10 years on average [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], although polyps are ordinarily removed when found so this estimate is imprecise. Polyps and cancers are distributed approximately evenly throughout the colon and rectum but tend to be more proximal in women and with increasing age.</p><p>Some colon cancers arise from nonpolypoid adenomas that are flat or depressed and account for 22 to 36 percent of identified adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Flat and depressed lesions are difficult to detect and are recognizable by subtle distortion of the mucosal pattern and special stains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Large, flat adenomas &ge;8 mm may be more likely to contain dysplastic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] than polypoid ones of comparable size.</p><p>Most colorectal polyps are either adenomatous or hyperplastic, which cannot be distinguished reliably by gross appearance; biopsy is required for diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66254\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66254 \">picture 1</a>). Hyperplastic polyps usually do not progress to cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two-thirds of polyps are adenomas. Adenomas are found in over 30 percent of men and 20 percent of women, and the prevalence increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Hyperplastic polyps account for most of the remaining polyps and are typically small (&lt;1 cm) and distal. They are generally not premalignant, although there are rare reports of cancers arising from isolated hyperplastic polyps. Patients with small (&lt;1 cm) colorectal hyperplastic polyps are considered to have normal colonoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A rare syndrome, hyperplastic polyposis, is associated with a large number of hyperplastic polyps and an increased risk of CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of CRC increases with adenoma size, number, and histology (eg, villous adenomas are a greater risk than tubular adenomas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The finding of one adenomatous polyp suggests a propensity to form polyps, especially if it is large (&ge;8 mm), and the patient should be evaluated for other lesions in the colon and rectum. The number and types of lesions found will determine the appropriate interval for subsequent surveillance colonoscopy.</p><p>The incidence of CRC varies about 15-fold across regions of the world, and people who move from low- to high-risk regions acquire higher rates during their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], suggesting environmental causes.</p><p>Removal of adenomatous polyps prevents cancer. The National Polyp Study followed 1418 patients in whom colonoscopic examination led to the removal of one or more polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. During a mean follow-up of six years, the incidence of colon cancer was 88 to 90 percent lower than in patients reported in other studies who had polyps that were not removed and 76 percent lower than in the general population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6271688\"><span class=\"h2\">Right-sided versus left-sided lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A gradual shift toward right-sided or proximal colon cancers has been observed both in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>] and internationally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], with the greatest relative increase in incidence in the cecum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This change in the anatomic distribution of CRCs may be partly due to improvements in diagnosis and treatment, and increased screening by flexible sigmoidoscopy with removal of adenomatous polyps in the descending colon, but there also appears to be a true increase in the incidence of ascending colon and cecal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>].

Interventions considered were at the level of the patient, provider, or health care system. Those programs that involved changes in the system of care, such as providing a patient navigator or eliminating barriers to providing FOBT cards, were most effective and increased the absolute rate of screening from 7 to 28 percent. In a randomized trial involving patients identified as high risk for nonadherence, patients assigned to a patient navigator had higher rates of CRC screening than control patients (13.7 versus 7 percent), though rates were low in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].

We suggest that screening be continued until the life expectancy for an individual patient is estimated as less than 10 years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For most patients, it is reasonable to stop screening at age 75 years or 85 years at the latest. For adults who have never been screened for CRC, a one-time screening with colonoscopy (to age 83) or sigmoidoscopy (to age 84) is advised. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for average-risk screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Screening in older adults'</a> above and <a href=\"#H445203973\" class=\"local\">'Older adults with no prior screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be advised of the risks and benefits of different screening options. The decision about which option to select should be made between the patient and clinician, weighing factors of effectiveness, safety, cost, patient preference, and availability of the screening tests.
