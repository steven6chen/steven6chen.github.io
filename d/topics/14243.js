In 2015, the incidence of burns severe enough to require hospital outpatient presentation or an admission to hospital was 31 million people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of burns occur in low- to middle-income countries, regions that generally lack the necessary infrastructure to reduce the incidence and severity of burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Burn injury prevention includes four stages: surveillance, analysis, intervention, and evaluation and involves the three E's: education, engineering, and enforcement. Through a combination of prevention and care strategies, high-income countries have made progress reducing the incidence of burn injuries and burn severity and lowering rates of burn deaths and length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. </p><p>This topic reviews the interventions that are effective and necessary to reduce the risk of burns. The epidemiology and costs of burn injuries are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of burn injuries globally&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-costs-of-fires-and-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global costs of fires and burns&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to burn injury prevention includes surveillance, analysis, intervention, and evaluation. A precise description of the magnitude of the risks for burn injuries is the basis for planning effective interventions. Accurate data on the incidence of burns and the causes are scarce for many low- to low-middle-income countries. A lack of reliable data on risk factors further hampers the development and enactment of effective burn prevention strategies. Incomplete reporting of burn incidents leads to an underestimate of the magnitude of the public health problem.</p><p>Collection of data specific to etiologies of burns has been challenging. The most efficient approach is to join modules specific for injury causation with existing data collection systems. As an example, software was developed to use the comprehensive categorization of multiple facets of injury events as described by the International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI). This software was then used by registrars collecting and entering data into the National Burn Repository of the American Burn association. Use of this tool significantly augmented the quality and quantity of etiologic data entered into the existing data repository [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A global registry has been developed through collaboration among the World Health Organization, Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, and the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control. A process evaluation in 30 countries showed good user acceptance and the potential to prioritize the selection, development, and testing of primary prevention interventions throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The Childhood Burn Foundation in Taiwan is an excellent example of a model surveillance system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The foundation provided resources to 43 hospitals to collect data on hospitalized burn patients. This comprehensive database, which utilizes the internet for data entry, captured information on over 12,000 patients from 1997 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The leading causes of all burn injuries include scald (43.2 percent), flame (32.5 percent), contact (11.2 percent), chemical (6.6 percent), and electrical (5.6 percent). The most common locations for incurring a burn injury include occupational setting (32.1 percent) and domestic setting (31.8 percent). The ultimate goal of a surveillance program is to convert the results into an action plan to prevent burn injuries.</p><p>Overall, the positive factors associated with burn prevention include improvement in socioeconomic status, improved housing, provision of basic amenities (eg, water), proper regulation and design of industrial products (eg, kerosene stove), proper storage of flammable substances, and supervision of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional approach to burn injury prevention involves the three E's: education, engineering, and enforcement. Education is an active process that requires behavior modification. There are very little data on the effectiveness of fire prevention educational programs. Passive measures, such as engineering or product design and legislation, have been more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>There is clearly a gap in understanding about risk and prevention of injuries in the community. A study in South Africa showed that people living in environments in which burns are likely to occur (such as informal settlements) are not well educated about burn prevention and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Parents and other caregivers of children in Thailand were surveyed for their knowledge of injury prevention awareness in the home. Although 90 percent of respondents recognized the need to ensure inaccessibility to matches and lighters, only 60 percent saw the need to restrict access to the kitchen stove and cover unused electrical outlets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Traditional approaches to educational intervention have had limited success. Evaluation of a burn prevention program for children in a rural area of Zambia demonstrated some improvement in burn knowledge but also an unfortunately large residual deficit after education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A review of 30 pediatric burn prevention strategies from 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">developing/developed</span> countries found only two papers that evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. It appears, based on limited data, that multipronged community-based interventions were most effective to reduce the risk of burn injuries. The likely explanation is that these multifaceted community approaches typically focus on effective prevention communication, which has been documented to improve outcomes such as the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Injury prevention programs conducted in Israel between 1998 and 2000 were effective in reducing pediatric burn-related hospitalizations from 1.39 to 1.05 per 1000 infants, in contrast to areas where the program did not exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The effect was greatest among infants and toddlers from affluent areas; there was no significant change in burn-related hospitalizations among school-aged children.</p><p>A comprehensive community-based injury prevention program in Harstad, Norway resulted in a 52.9 percent reduction in burn injuries in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This educational program strengthened public participation and enhanced community empowerment by recording and using the local burn injury data.</p><p>Although many resources are expended on community education, the beneficial effects are not clear. Two previous publications reviewing the literature to 1999 did not identify evidence of beneficial effects from community, school, or clinic-based fire safety education on fire injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Counseling and educational interventions had only a modest effect on the likelihood of owning a smoke alarm, or having a functional alarm, but these effects were enhanced in the setting of primary child health care surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) show that educational programs effectively reduce hazardous behaviors, incidence of burns, morbidity, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The effectiveness of education programs for burn prevention may be enhanced by targeting specific at-risk groups with culturally appropriate teaching tools. Based on research done in Amish communities, school-based tools including story boards, safety curriculum, and test questions were provided to private schools in Amish communities in eight US states. Burn prevention knowledge was significantly improved by this tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In the rapidly evolving environment of social media, there may be novel opportunities for preventing burn injuries. In 2013, there were 21 videos posted on YouTube with technically accurate content covering prevention and first aid treatment of pediatric burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Due to the ease of access and wide audience (over 6 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube), there are exciting opportunities to use these platforms to raise public awareness of burn prevention and treatment, although validation of content by qualified health care professionals is still a challenge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Engineering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Engineering (modification of agents or environment) and enforcement (creation and implementation of guidelines, codes and laws) require more resources than education programs but also are more effective. The following are examples of successful approaches to reducing the incidence and severity of burns:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoke detectors and alarms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoke detectors serve as an early warning of fire and, hence, reduce the risk of burns by allowing occupants to escape the burning building. Sprinklers offer passive protection of burns, important for children, the handicapped, and the elderly, who may not be sufficiently mobile to escape a fire.</p><p>Early smoke detection systems include different types of fire warning equipment that detect heat or smoke. The rapid rate of installation in US homes (less than 5 percent in 1970 compared to 67 percent in 1982) was attributed to market price reduction, intensive marketing, programs led by local fire departments, and building code modification and legislation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Ninety-six percent of occupants of homes surveyed have at least one working smoke alarm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The death rate per 100 reported home structure fires from 2003 to 2006 in the US was twice as high when no working smoke alarm was present (eg, either no smoke alarm was present or an alarm was present but did not operate) compared with the rate with working smoke alarms (1.16 versus 0.59). Having a working smoke alarm decreases the chances of dying in a residential fire by 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The effectiveness of smoke alarm distribution projects can be greatly enhanced by community canvassing programs that involve both the local fire departments and community health workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Inversely correlating with the rise in usage of smoke detectors has been the decline in residential fire and flame deaths. The age-adjusted death rate in 1981 from residential fires was 2.28 per 100,000; by 1997 that rate was reduced by almost 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although smoke alarms have contributed significantly to this reduction in mortality, other factors have been beneficial as well, including safer heating and cooking appliances; child-resistant lighters; flame-resistant mattresses, furniture, and clothing; and improvement in acute care of burn victims.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Water temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although scald burns are nearly as common as flame burns, a World Health Organization (WHO) report found that only 5.4 percent of all burn deaths were attributed to scalds compared with 93 percent of fire-related deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of burn injuries globally&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-costs-of-fires-and-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global costs of fires and burns&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hot tap water causes nearly one-quarter of all pediatric scald burns, and most of these occur in the bathroom. The damage caused by hot tap water burns tends to be more severe than that by other types of scald burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In an animal study, partial- or full-thickness burns occurred after six hours of exposure to water at 111&ordm;F (44&ordm;C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Yet if the temperature of the water was increased to 140&ordm;F (60&ordm;C), burns occurred within three seconds of exposure. Water at 120&ordm;F (49&ordm;C) took 10 minutes to cause significant thermal injury to the skin, and this temperature is considered to be the ideal setting to reduce the risk of a serious burn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Lamps and stoves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is anticipated that the global use of kerosene in lamps and stoves will continue for years to come. In low-income communities in particular, kerosene is used for cooking, light, and heat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Although there is slow progress in providing electricity to residences in low-income countries, less than one-quarter of the homes in sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A retrospective review of 11,196 burn admissions found that 82 percent of burns were due to flames and 35 percent of flame burns were due to malfunctioning kerosene stoves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A prospective study of 345 burn patients found that 41 percent of accidental burns were the result of <span class=\"nowrap\">fire/flame</span> from a kerosene bottle lamp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Wicks placed in discarded beverage or medicine bottles, and even from burned-out light bulbs, serve as makeshift lamps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The use of kerosene stoves is even more widespread than homemade kerosene lamps, and the magnitude of injury, death, and destruction that accompanies them places a tremendous burden on low-income communities. In Nepal, cooking, heating, and lighting, using kerosene and biomass as the major fuels, were the main activities associated with burn injury in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The National Fire Protection Association states that space heating poses a much higher risk of fire, death, injury, and loss per million users than central heating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Prevention of lamp burns in LMICs includes three approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first approach is to use an educational campaign that teaches safe handling and use of kerosene lamps, including avoiding replenishment of the fuel reservoir while the wick is lit and placing the lamps on stable surfaces. A prospective quasiexperimental design study in low-income South African communities found that there was a significant increase in self-reported knowledge, safety practices, and recognition of injury risk associated with kerosene in the intervention community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second approach is to use safer oil, such as vegetable oils (eg, coconut and sesame oils). Unfortunately, these oils are too heavy to rise to the top of the wick and do not perform well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third approach is to provide impoverished families with an inexpensive and safe lamp. Such a lamp was designed by a surgeon in 1992 in Sri Lanka [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The lamp is compact and heavy, so that it does not easily tip over, and has two flat sides that prevent it from rolling if it does tip over. The screw-top lid averts fuel spillage, and the thick slow-cooled glass used for construction is essentially unbreakable. Over 775,000 safe bottle lamps have been distributed in Sri Lanka as of December 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. It is produced from recycled glass for approximately US$ 0.25 each, and its production also provides a boost to the local economy. The safe lamp has been credited in the lay press with a significant reduction in burn injuries and fires in Sri Lanka [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p>As more households in resource-limited settings move away from kerosene as a fuel source for domestic stoves and heaters, there has been an increase in the number of injuries sustained from the use of natural gas and propane. In the decade 2005 to 2014 in Ecuador, domestic methane gas was the most frequent agent causing thermal burns in patients admitted to the specialized public hospital in Quito [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Fireworks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fireworks are associated with national and cultural celebrations throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. On Independence Day in the US each year, more fires are reported than on any other day of the year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As a prelude to the arrival of spring since at least 1700 BCE, Persians have celebrated Chaharshanbe-Suri on the last Wednesday night of the year. The festivities include participants jumping over bonfires in the streets and setting off fireworks, both hazardous activities. Despite the ubiquity of these practices in Persia and their persistence since ancient times, only 1 percent of surveyed families acknowledged having any education on the safe use of fireworks in 2007 in Tehran, Iran; over 98 percent of families were ignorant of fireworks safety standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Flame-retardant materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the development of flame-retardant clothes, the burn mortality rate of girls exceeded that of boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This excess mortality was attributed to loosely fitting, easily flammable nightgowns and dresses. When children's sleepwear was made of a flame-retardant material 2,3-dibromopropyl (referred to as &quot;tris&quot;), burn admissions were reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, tris was found to be highly mutagenic and was banned as a clothing additive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Most synthetic fabrics are fire resistant but melt when exposed to high heat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Low ignition propensity cigarettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarettes are responsible for approximately 10 to 20 percent of fire-related burns in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>] and one-third of fire-related deaths and most nonfatal fire injuries in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Most fire deaths are associated with ignition of upholstered furniture, mattresses, and bedding by dropped cigarettes. One-quarter of fatalities from tobacco-related fires were victims, not smokers.</p><p>The wrapping paper for a cigarette varies in degree of porosity. The porosity allows ventilation of the burning ember. Burning agents in the cigarette paper are responsible for fires. The application of microcrystalline cellulose to the paper controls the burning rate and stability of the ash, and reducing the burning agents in the paper reduces the ignition propensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].</p><p>Paper wrapping with thin bands of paper of different porosity lowers ignition propensity. These bands are inserted at intervals down the length of the cigarette, causing the cigarette to extinguish if not repeatedly smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/54,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Enforcement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passage and enforcement of legislation in any country is often challenging, and education programs may be the best option for injury prevention in some cases. Only with an accurate appreciation of the burden of burn injuries within a region can effective lobbying efforts move forward in funding agencies and government health departments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoke detector legislation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoke detector installation is an effective and inexpensive strategy to reduce the risk of burns in residential settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In 1975, the US Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) building code was amended to require a smoke detector protecting the bedroom area in each dwelling unit of new construction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Inversely correlating with the rise in usage of smoke detectors has been the decline in residential fire and flame deaths. The age-adjusted death rate in 1981 from residential fires was 2.28; by 1997 that rate was reduced by almost 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Water temperature regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1977, 80 percent of homes in Washington state had tap water temperatures greater than 129&ordm;F (54&ordm;C). In 1983 a Washington state law was passed, requiring new water heaters to be preset at 120&ordm;F (49&ordm;C). Five years later, 77 percent of homes (84 percent of homes with postlaw and 70 percent of homes with prelaw water heaters) had tap water temperatures of less than 129&ordm;F (54&ordm;C). Mean temperature in 1988 was 122&ordm;F (50&ordm;C) compared with 142&ordm;F (61&ordm;C) in 1977.</p><p>Few people increase their heater temperature after installation. The impact of this measure was substantial in reducing the number of patients treated for scald burns. Eighteen burn victims were identified from July 1979 through May 1988, for an average admission rate of 2.4 per 100,000 per year, compared with 5.5 per year prior to enacting this legislation. Thus, the combination of education and legislation appeared to have resulted in a reduction in frequency, morbidity, and mortality of tap water burn injuries in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Stove design and fuel regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Verification of fuel quality, safety of fuel storage and usage, and dispersion of appropriately designed appliances should reduce burn hazards. Compulsory standards covering the performance, safety, and requirements for nonpressure paraffin-fueled cooking stoves and heaters intended primarily for domestic use were enacted by the South African government in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The standard for nonpressure stoves and heaters is the only compulsory standard in place. The standard for pressurized kerosene-fueled appliances is voluntary, and none of the pressure appliances on the market has applied for approval from South Africa Bureau of Standards Commercial against this standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>The inevitable transition from open fires and unregulated kerosene appliances toward more sophisticated devices for cooking, heating, and lighting to reduce burn injuries in LMICs is not without hazard. In Delhi, for example, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)-related burns accounted for less than 1 percent of admissions to a single burn center from 1993 to 2000 but from 2001 to 2007 were responsible for over 10 percent of admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Electrification reduces the risk of disasters caused by malfunctioning kerosene stoves but increases the risk of fires and burns from electrical injury because of substandard wiring techniques, unsafe practices, illegal poaching of power and scavenging copper from overhead lines, and inadequate barriers around high-voltage poles and towers. Thus, as developing communities convert to more common use of LPG and electricity, steps must be taken to ensure safety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Fireworks legislation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduction in fireworks-related injuries has been observed as a result of focused campaigns. The US government prohibits the sale of the most dangerous types of fireworks to consumers, including reloadable shells, cherry bombs, aerial bombs, M-80 salutes, firecrackers containing more than two grains of powder, and mail-order kits for building fireworks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The impact of legislation on the incidence of fireworks-related injuries suggests a reduction in the number of related burns. Presumably because of the proliferation of fireworks legislation, the number of fireworks injuries in the United Kingdom decreased from 707 in 2001 to 494 in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Conversely, after repeal of a law banning private fireworks in Minnesota, there was an increase in the number of children suffering fireworks-related burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>In Denmark, where fireworks are commonly used at New Year's celebrations, prohibition of the sale of firecrackers coupled with school education programs led to a reduction in the number of children treated for fireworks injuries at two Danish burn centers from 17 in 1991 to 1992 to only three children in 1993 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>In India, fireworks injuries commonly occur during Diwali (Festival of Lights). The experience at one hospital in Mumbai from 1997 through 2006 was that the prevalence of fireworks injuries was decreasing, due to aggressive education campaigns by government and nongovernment organizations. Forty-one injuries were treated at the beginning of the study period; only three injuries were treated in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Flammable Fabrics Act</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Flammable Fabric Act was passed in the US in 1953 to regulate the manufacture of highly flammable clothing and amended in 1967 to expand coverage to internal furnishings. This legislation regulates the material construction of a broad range of consumer products (eg, carpets, night clothes, mattresses, upholstered furniture, tents, curtains, sleeping bags and children's clothing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/29,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,60</a>]. A retrospective study of children admitted to the Shriners Burns Institute of Boston from 1969 through 1976 showed that the promulgation of flammability standards reduced the incidence of flame burns from the ignition of sleepwear in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) estimated that the enactment of the flammability standards for sleepwear in 1971 resulted in a tenfold decrease in childhood deaths caused by ignition of sleepwear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Fire-safe cigarette legislation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>US consumer safety movements since the 1970s have focused on legislating mandatory production of fire-safe cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Under the &quot;fire-safe&quot; cigarette laws, a cigarette must burn out 75 percent of the time when not in active use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>In 2003, the first state law requiring all cigarettes to be low-ignition was passed in the state of New York [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. By the end of 2009, all states except Wyoming had either passed or enacted fire-safe cigarette legislation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. There has been a reduction in smoking material fires of 57 percent from 1980 to 2006. Both the decline in cigarette consumption as well as standards and regulations that have made mattresses and upholstered furniture more resistant to ignition have contributed to this trend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Canada has passed a similar nationwide legislation based on the same standards as the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

ASF has been raising public awareness, building institutional capacity and lobbying, working with other nongovernmental organizations, the media, celebrities, and student groups to elevate community consciousness. It has also fostered advocacy and lobbying efforts with the government to ensure the passage and enforcement of laws and to create systems to provide service to acid survivors. As a result, the number of victims has dropped from 490 in 2002 to 171 in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Based on the success of ASF, similar organizations have been formed in Cambodia, India, Pakistan, and Uganda.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the World Health Organization (WHO) are to promote the development of burn control measures, to include improvements in burn prevention and strengthened burn care, to improve information and surveillance systems, and to encourage investment in research and training in burn prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The most important point from their review are as follows: </p><p>A large burden of burn injury-related morbidity and mortality exists in the world; this burden is disproportionately experienced within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and, finally, a number of interventions can be put in place to prevent burns.</p><p>The initial first priority in confronting any public health problem has always been to establish the epidemiologic profile of the problem and elucidate its risk factors; however, this has been problematic with the study of burns. Although the burden of burn injury and death is experienced primarily in LMICs, the majority of scientific studies that underlie the evidence base on interventions to prevent burns come from high-income countries (HICs). Furthermore, the epidemiologic picture of the circumstances giving rise to burns comes almost entirely from HICs, with few from LMICs. This fragmented and relatively superficial examination of burn injury in low-income settings means that it is difficult for the WHO to be confident in promoting any one course of action as a priority for LMICs to prevent burns. </p><p>In an effort to improve data collection regarding burns, the WHO has been working with a global network of burn experts from the clinical, epidemiologic, and research sectors. A first priority has been the creation of the Global Burn Registry (GBR). This uses a simple, standardized form to gather information about burns. The data give health facilities a clear picture of the major risk factors and populations at risk for burns in their setting, as well as how these compare and contrast with other settings. This information is key to identify and prioritize programs to prevent burn injuries. Data can be viewed online or exported for further analysis. More information about the GBR, as well as directions to participate in it or access its data, is available on <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/&amp;token=CGrU2PnO7/NB7T04m20ugC+zLcATjtABVjjPnO2pcZA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=824\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">the WHO website</a>.</p><p>Whereas the GBR provides a standardized platform for gathering health-facility based data, this is insufficient. Many important aspects of burn injuries are best understood with community-based surveys, since these can capture important information about long-term sequelae and can also provide estimates of the burn burden relative to other health conditions. Community-based surveys also provide information on burn injuries that may have been deemed as not requiring health-facility care, or not resulting in facility care because this was too expensive or the injury was so severe that health-facility care could not be provided prior to the patient dying. </p><p>Accordingly, the WHO has also worked with global burn injury experts and epidemiologists to develop a modular battery of questions for burn injury. These have been developed within the context of an instrument that probes all injury outcomes and then provides more comprehensive information about burns. The community survey module has been pilot tested in LMICs and found to yield valid and relevant information about burns and their sequelae.</p><p>Improving and, in particular, developing standardized platforms for data collection on burns is only a first step. Once the global community working on burn care and burn prevention is equipped with and using these tools widely, the major etiologic factors that give rise to burns will become clearer, as will the priority risk factors that need to be targeted in order to prevent burns. These steps will require governments and donors to invest in funding operational research and will require epidemiologists and scholars to set up methodologically rigorous studies to examine burn injuries and how they may be prevented in LMICs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF BURN INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are practical suggestions to reduce the risk of fires, scalds, and burns resulting from accidents in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-fire-and-burn-injuries/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].
