Good glycemic control remains important intrapartum because maternal hyperglycemia during labor increases the risk for fetal acidemia and neonatal hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Postpartum, avoidance of hyperglycemia is less critical, but the risk for maternal hypoglycemia increases because of large, rapid changes in maternal hormone concentrations after delivery of the placenta.</p><p>It should be noted that intrapartum maternal normoglycemia will not reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia in women with poor antepartum glycemic control, since fetal pancreatic hyperplasia and excessive in utero insulin secretion have been established in response to prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia. These neonates are at risk of developing severe and prolonged hypoglycemia.

If oral intake is permitted, a reduced calorie diet (eg, 50 percent of daily caloric intake) will meet energy demands. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If oral intake is prohibited or severely restricted, maternal energy demands can usually be met over the short-term by metabolism of stored hepatic glycogen. As time in latent phase lengthens, glycogen stores will become depleted so an intravenous glucose-containing solution will be needed, with or without half normal saline. Normal saline is avoided to minimize sodium load.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active phase</strong> -- Active labor is an intense exercise with increased energy requirements. Most women, including those without diabetes, receive a 5 percent glucose solution intravenously because glucose demands cannot be met by oral intake, which is usually limited or prohibited during the active phase, and because hepatic glycogen stores are rapidly depleted. Studies using glucose-controlled insulin infusion systems have shown that glucose requirements increase to about 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/min</span> to maintain maternal glucose concentration at 70 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This is analogous to the requirement observed with sustained and vigorous exercise. Intrapartum administration of glucose may also be important for optimal myometrial function. In a randomized trial, administration of a 5 percent glucose-containing solution significantly shortened labor compared with normal saline infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3723997068\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During both the latent and active phases of labor, women with type 2 and gestational diabetes generally produce sufficient endogenous insulin to maintain euglycemia without supplemental exogenous insulin. Women with type 1 diabetes have no endogenous insulin production and therefore require exogenous basal insulin in the latent phase to maintain euglycemia and prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. In the active phase, insulin requirements are lower than in latent phase. Studies using glucose-controlled insulin infusion systems have shown that insulin requirements drop to almost zero in the active phase. (See <a href=\"#H102675672\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for insulin management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102677248\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAPARTUM MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The changes in glucose and insulin requirements during labor mandate monitoring blood glucose concentration in women who have been treated with insulin or oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs during pregnancy. The frequency of monitoring depends on the phase of labor, diet, and whether exogenous insulin is being administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587508846\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucose monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capillary blood glucose measurements are convenient and reasonably accurate over the normal range of blood glucose concentrations, but are more variable than venous measurements. In addition, each type of glucose meter has a manufacturer's limit of accuracy for a range of capillary blood glucose values; intrapartum capillary blood glucose values outside of these ranges should be confirmed by venous blood measurements, which can be tested first at the bedside with the glucose meter and then in the laboratory. However, overt hypoglycemia (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> or hyperglycemia (&gt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> detected in capillary blood should be treated promptly, before confirmation has been obtained.</p><p>The optimum frequency of glucose monitoring required to maintain target glucose levels has not been established. Glycemic control depends on endogenous insulin secretion and insulin resistance; thus, closer monitoring is required in women with type 1 diabetes than in many women with type 2 or gestational diabetes. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregestational diabetes</strong> -- During the latent phase, we measure glucose levels every two to four hours in women with minimal oral intake and type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and women labeled &ldquo;gestational diabetics&rdquo; who in our opinion are likely to have previously undiagnosed type 2 diabetes because of diagnosis in early pregnancy. If the woman is eating, we monitor capillary glucose levels before and after meals. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During the active phase, we measure glucose levels every one to two hours in women who are not receiving an insulin infusion, and every hour if insulin is being infused. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gestational diabetes</strong> -- Women with gestational diabetes who have maintained euglycemia antenatally on diet, lifestyle, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical therapy rarely develop intrapartum hyperglycemia. A blood glucose level is measured on admission. During the latent phase, we monitor capillary glucose levels before and after meals. In the absence of significant oral intake, we check glucose levels no more frequently than every four to six hours. Monitoring frequency can be decreased in women with glucose values consistently within the target range. Women with glucose levels below or above target ranges should receive appropriate therapy and more frequent monitoring. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11129719\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucose target</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal intrapartum target glucose level to reduce the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes is not clear, and is complicated because the intrapartum maternal glucose level is not the only factor affecting neonatal metabolic outcome. Antepartum glycemic control, gestational age, birth weight, and pregnancy and neonatal complications also affect neonatal metabolism.</p><p>In the absence of proven goals, <strong>a reasonable target range for intrapartum glucose levels is &gt;70 and &lt;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&gt;3.9 and &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</strong>,</span> as this range has not been associated with clinically important neonatal hypoglycemia in insulin-requiring women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This target range encompasses recommendations of both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Intrapartum glucose levels above 140 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> are consistently associated with neonatal hypoglycemia and an increased risk of maternal ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Although neonatal hypoglycemia may be the most common consequence of maternal intrapartum hyperglycemia, the most dangerous complication of intrapartum hyperglycemia is fetal hyperglycemia, which increases fetal oxygen requirements at a time when the ability of the placenta to provide an adequate supply of oxygen is compromised by uterine contractions. If intrapartum hyperglycemia occurs on a background of chronically poor maternal metabolic control (high glycated hemoglobin [A1C]), maternal hemoglobin will carry less oxygen, bind it more tightly, and therefore release it less well in areas of low oxygen tension, such as the intervillous space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This can result in fetal hypoxemia and acidosis. Physiologically, macrosomic fetuses of women in chronically poor glycemic control will tolerate acute intrapartum maternal hyperglycemia less well than normally grown fetuses of women with chronically good glycemic control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102675672\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines for insulin management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Well-designed, sufficiently powered, randomized trials on intrapartum insulin management do not exist to guide recommendations for an optimal approach. Available evidence is largely retrospective or derived from groups of women with type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes treated with the same protocol, thus not accounting for the wide differences in beta cell reserve and insulin resistance in women with different underlying metabolic disorders. Furthermore, most of the medical literature precedes the widespread use of the newer insulins, the use of oral agents, and continuous glucose infusion systems. </p><p>We individualize management, considering the woman&rsquo;s medical regimen prior to labor (eg, whether she used long-acting basal insulin with premeal short-acting insulin, twice-daily dosing of intermediate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>, or oral anti-hyperglycemic agents). The following approaches should not be considered absolute protocols. Clinicians managing women with diabetes who are in labor must be experienced in euglycemic medical management and able to adjust regimens to meet changing intrapartum needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H841881\"><span class=\"h3\">Women with pregestational diabetes using multiple daily insulin injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with pregestational diabetes using multiple daily insulin injections for control of blood glucose, the author prefers to use a subcutaneous insulin regimen for glucose control during labor. Euglycemia is maintained by giving one unit of subcutaneous insulin for each 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> increase in glucose above 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96566 \">table 1</a>). This scale works well for most laboring women who require insulin. Adjustments to the scale should consider the individual&rsquo;s degree of insulin resistance (eg, total daily insulin dose per kg) and the rapid acting insulin correction factors used predelivery. </p><p>Infusion of intravenous insulin to maintain euglycemia during labor is a reasonable alternative to subcutaneous insulin. This approach has been associated with low maternal and neonatal complication rates in women with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>], and can be used for women with type 2 or gestational diabetes requiring insulin. An example of intrapartum regimen is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96566 \">table 1</a>).

The protocol involved setting up the pump with three different insulin basal rates and activating the most appropriate one, depending on the stage of labor and current glucose value, with correction boluses and IV glucose infusions, as needed. The three basal insulin rates were (1) the last antepartum level; (2) 30, 50, or 70 percent below the last antepartum level (based on whether the patient had a low, average, or high antepartum insulin requirement); and (3) 0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/h</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3283755774\"><span class=\"h3\">Women with gestational diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with gestational diabetes, a strategy of &quot;rotating fluids&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76661 \">table 2</a>) has been used as it decreases the need for insulin infusion.

However, if she uses a long-acting insulin at night (detemir or glargine), the dose is decreased by 50 percent, or switched to NPH insulin and one-third of the long-acting nightly dose is given.</p><p>The morning dose of insulin or oral anti-diabetic agent is held and the patient is given nothing by mouth. In women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, if surgery occurs later in the day, basal insulin (about one-third of the morning dose of intermediate- or long-acting insulin) is given with a 5 percent dextrose infusion in order to avoid ketosis. Glucose levels should be monitored frequently, every one to three hours, with more frequent measurements in type 1 diabetes or if glucose levels are not in the target range; a short- or rapid-acting insulin can be given as needed to control hyperglycemia during this period. For intravenous prehydration before operative anesthesia, normal saline is used rather than a dextrose solution to avoid administering a large glucose bolus, which reduces umbilical cord pH and can cause neonatal hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-and-gestational-diabetes-intrapartum-and-postpartum-glycemic-control/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In women with diabetes, surgery in the early morning generally avoids the need for insulin.</p><p>Glucose levels should be monitored during the cesarean delivery if the operation lasts over an hour.

In women with continuous insulin infusion pumps, infusion is set at 50 percent of the basal rate, with bolus insulin doses based on grams of carbohydrate ingested. Continued oral intake (at 50 percent of daily intake, 1000 to 1200 kcal) is permitted during cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">ripening/latent</span> phase when this period is anticipated to exceed 8 to 12 hours and there is a low risk of emergency operative delivery (eg, reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, stable maternal condition).

Blood glucose levels can drop rapidly during nursing due to the high metabolic demand. Thus, self-monitoring of glucose is important during the early postpartum period in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes requiring insulin therapy. The frequency of glucose monitoring in women with type 2 diabetes on oral anti-hyperglycemic agents and breastfeeding is not established and should be guided by clinical judgment.</p><p>There is minimal information on milk levels and infant effects of many anti-hyperglycemic agents.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with type 2 and gestational diabetes generally produce sufficient endogenous insulin and can maintain euglycemia during the latent phase of labor without supplemental exogenous insulin. Women with type 1 diabetes have no endogenous insulin production and require exogenous basal insulin to maintain euglycemia and prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. During the active phase, exogenous insulin may not be needed because increased energy expenditure reduces insulin requirements to almost zero. (See <a href=\"#H102675478\" class=\"local\">'Intrapartum glucose and insulin requirements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with diabetes treated with anti-hyperglycemic drugs antepartum, a reasonable approach for intrapartum glucose monitoring is every two to four hours during the latent phase, every one to two hours during the active phase, and every hour when insulin is being infused. Women with gestational diabetes who have maintained euglycemia antenatally on diet, lifestyle, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical therapy rarely develop intrapartum hyperglycemia; blood glucose levels may be measured on admission and then no more frequently than every four to six hours. Monitoring frequency can be decreased in women with glucose values consistently within the target range. If the woman is eating during latent phase, pre- and post-prandial capillary glucose levels should be monitored. Women with glucose levels below or above target ranges should receive appropriate therapy and more frequent monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H102677248\" class=\"local\">'Intrapartum management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In absence of clear goals, a reasonable target range for intrapartum glucose levels is &gt;70 and &lt;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&gt;3.9 and &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> as a similar range has not been associated with clinically important neonatal hypoglycemia in insulin-requiring women. This range encompasses recommendations of both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines. Intrapartum glucose levels above 140 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> have been consistently associated with neonatal hypoglycemia and an increased risk of maternal ketoacidosis. (See <a href=\"#H102677248\" class=\"local\">'Intrapartum management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes on a multiple daily insulin injection regimen, we suggest using subcutaneous insulin rather than intravenous insulin for intrapartum glycemic control (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, both strategies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96566 \">table 1</a>) are effective and have low complication rates. For women with gestational diabetes, rotating fluids between glucose containing and non-glucose containing fluids can help with glycemic control and minimize the need for insulin administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76661 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H102675672\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for insulin management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before scheduled early morning induction or cesarean delivery, the patient should maintain her usual nighttime dose of intermediate-acting insulin, short- or rapid-acting insulin, oral anti-diabetic medication, or continuous insulin infusion. On the morning of cesarean delivery, the morning dose of insulin or oral anti-diabetic agent is held and the patient is given nothing by mouth. On the morning of induction, the woman eats a light breakfast and reduces her insulin dose (NPH and short- or rapid-acting insulin), generally by 50 percent. Continuous insulin infusion pumps are set at approximately 50 percent of the basal rate, with bolus insulin based on carbohydrate exchanges. (See <a href=\"#H102677408\" class=\"local\">'Special situations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After delivery of the placenta, the insulin resistant state that characterizes pregnancy rapidly disappears. Women with type 1 diabetes need close glucose monitoring to avoid hypoglycemia, since insulin requirements drop precipitously. Women with type 2 diabetes may have normal to elevated glucose levels during the first 24 to 48 hours postpartum and may not need any anti-hyperglycemic therapy. Women with gestational diabetes should have fasting glucose levels monitored for 24 to 72 hours after delivery to check for diabetes (fasting &gt;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. Unless overt diabetes is diagnosed postpartum, women with gestational diabetes should be screened or tested for diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery to establish glucose status. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum, glucose targets can be relaxed. In the first 24 to 48 hours after delivery, we manage hyperglycemia in women with type or type 2 diabetes with insulin prescribed using a sliding scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96567 \">table 3</a>).
