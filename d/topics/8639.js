A combination of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal gene mutations being the most common, making the argument that idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is primarily a genetic disorder with many definitive disease-causing mutations identified. The latter includes TNNI3, TNNT2, TPN1, MYH7, DES, MYBPC3, LMNA, FLNC, and LAMP2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Other studies have reported sarcomere protein mutations (in cardiac troponin I, troponin T, titin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and alpha-cardiac actin genes) in children with idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy with family history of restrictive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, or left ventricular noncompaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Familial restrictive cardiomyopathies not related to amyloidosis are rare.

The natural history reported in one five-generation family is of symptomatic disease that develops after the third decade of life, with an insidious downhill course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Individuals who survive into the fifth decade develop a progressive non-wasting skeletal myopathy. </p><p>Another cause of familial restrictive cardiomyopathy is desminopathy, a skeletal and cardiac myopathy caused by mutations in desmin or alpha B crystallin, a chaperone for desmin.

Affected patients have symptoms and signs of both pulmonary and systemic congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. The most common symptoms include dyspnea, peripheral edema, palpitations, fatigue, weakness, and exercise intolerance due to failure of the cardiac output to increase with an increase in heart rate without further compromising ventricular filling. Restrictive cardiomyopathy has been associated with peripheral autonomic dysfunction with advanced baroreflex sensitivity causing clinical deterioration and arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In advanced cases, there may be a marked elevation in central venous pressure, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and anasarca.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H947515325\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiovascular examination is often indistinguishable from that of constrictive pericarditis.

An inspiratory increase in venous pressure, known as Kussmaul's sign, may be seen. This finding is thought to be due at least in part to increased resistance to right atrial filling during inspiration. These findings occur with restrictive cardiomyopathy as well as with constrictive pericarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left ventricular impulse is usually normal with restrictive cardiomyopathy.

A third heart sound (S3 gallop) is frequently present with restrictive cardiomyopathy (but not with constrictive pericarditis) because of the abrupt cessation of the rapid ventricular filling (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>). Soft systolic murmurs of functional mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation are also common.

Obliquely elevated ST segment with notched or biphasic late peaking T wave as well as significant ST depression mimicking myocardial ischemia have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A case report suggested that significant ST depression with T inversion mimicking subendocardial ischemia is a potential predictor of sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These electrocardiographic abnormalities can also be seen in patients with constrictive pericarditis or infiltrative myocardial diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis. The QRS voltage is typically normal in idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy, not low as in constrictive pericarditis or amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest radiograph usually demonstrates cardiomegaly secondary to significant atrial enlargement with pulmonary venous congestion and pleural effusions. Presence of pericardial calcification should raise the suspicion of constrictive pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64005\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64005 \">image 1</a>), but absence of pericardial calcification does not exclude constrictive pericarditis.

Higher levels (eg, &ge;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> are suggestive of restrictive cardiomyopathy rather than constrictive pericarditis but are of limited diagnostic value in patients with renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Plasma concentrations of BNP are increased in patients with heart failure (HF). Measurement of plasma BNP or N-terminal (NT)-proBNP is helpful in the evaluation of patients with suspected HF when the diagnosis is uncertain.

However, there is significant overlap between the groups, particularly for BNP levels &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>. When BNP levels are mildly to moderately elevated (eg, &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> and thus consistent with either restrictive cardiomyopathy or constrictive pericarditis or when levels are nondiagnostic due to the presence of renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], tissue Doppler echocardiography may be helpful in identifying the correct diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Among patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, BNP is released in response to left ventricular dysfunction and wall stretch. However, wall stretch is limited in constrictive pericarditis by the thickened stiff pericardium. These physiologic differences likely explain the generally higher BNP levels seen in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy compared with patients with constrictive pericarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358096074\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restrictive cardiomyopathies are a heterogenous group of heart muscle diseases that frequently look alike on echocardiography.

Although not pathognomonic, the best features of restrictive cardiomyopathy are reduced mitral annular Doppler tissue velocities (septal e&rsquo; &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec,</span> lateral e&rsquo; &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec,</span> increased <span class=\"nowrap\">E/e&rsquo;</span> ratio &gt;14) and increased indexed left atrial volume, with septal e&rsquo; velocity approaching 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec</span> in late stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A comparative echocardiography-catheterization study in restrictive cardiomyopathies demonstrated that the best correlates of elevated catheterization-derived left ventricular end-diastolic pressure are lateral tissue Doppler imaging annular velocities, pulmonary venous A wave duration, and indexed left atrial volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In restrictive cardiomyopathy, wall thicknesses are typically normal, though they may be increased with certain infiltrative processes (eg, amyloidosis) or storage disease (eg, Fabry disease).

Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) enables identification of myocardial fibrosis, scar, necrosis, or infiltration. Characteristic patterns of LGE can aid diagnosis of certain disease processes. For example, amyloidosis causes diffuse left ventricular subendocardial or transmural LGE, which may also involve the right ventricle and atrial walls. In sarcoidosis, there is often patchy enhancement, such as at the base of the septum and base of the inferolateral wall, frequently not corresponding to any coronary artery distribution. Myocardial iron overload can be assessed by cardiac T2* measurements. In addition, similar to echocardiography, CMR-based tissue tracking can be used to differentiate restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

However, patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy require high filling pressure to maintain their cardiac output. Thus, systemic perfusion, as assessed by physical examination and measurement of the blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentration, should be carefully monitored. An otherwise unexplained elevation in the latter tests is indicative of hypoperfusion and further diuresis should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rate-lowering calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>) may have a therapeutic role by improving diastolic function and, via rate control, by increasing filling time (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>). This is based upon the observation that idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy may be a biochemical abnormality of the energy-dependent rapid filling phase of cardiac relaxation, a process that is rate-dependent and requires pumping of the calcium out of the cytosol and restoration of the sodium and calcium gradients across the sarcolemma.

Approximately two-thirds of deaths were cardiovascular, primarily due to heart failure, sudden death, arrhythmia, or a cerebrovascular accident.
