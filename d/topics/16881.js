A furuncle can occur at any site that contains hair follicles, especially in regions that are subject to friction and maceration (eg, face, neck, axillae, groin, thighs, and buttocks). The lesion may extend into the dermis and subcutaneous tissues and often serves as a nidus for cellulitis and skin abscess.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbuncle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A carbuncle is a coalescence of several inflamed follicles into a single inflammatory mass with purulent drainage from multiple follicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70089 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A skin abscess is a collection of pus within the dermis and deeper skin tissues. Skin abscesses manifest as painful, tender, fluctuant, and erythematous nodules, frequently surmounted by a pustule and surrounded by a rim of erythematous swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53261\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53261 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historical features and appearance usually help to distinguish skin abscesses from the other conditions in the differential diagnosis, which is described below. As a rule, incision and drainage is <strong>not</strong> indicated for these diseases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular malformation</strong> &ndash; Abscesses located near major blood vessels must be differentiated from aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations before incision and drainage is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72536\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72536 \">picture 4</a>). Incision of an aneurysm that mimics an abscess can lead to fatal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Identification of a vascular malformation can be made in several ways, including physical examination (eg, bruit or thrill may be present; distal pulses may be diminished) and Doppler ultrasound, which is the test of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired arteriovenous fistula of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myiasis</strong> &ndash; Botfly myiasis is a skin infection caused by larvae of the botfly that should be suspected in travelers returning from Central or South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Patients typically note an apparent insect bite that, instead of healing, slowly enlarges over time to a nodule measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54606\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54606 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62332\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62332 \">picture 6</a>). Patients may have a sensation of irritation, crawling, or episodic lancinating pain. Small amounts of serosanguineous fluid may drain from the lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-lesions-in-the-returning-traveler#H8401226\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin lesions in the returning traveler&quot;, section on 'Myiasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kerion</strong> &ndash; Patients with the fungal infection tinea capitis may develop a boggy, tender, exudative scalp mass called a kerion. This is an allergic inflammatory response to the fungal infection and not a true cutaneous abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75029\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75029 \">picture 7</a>). Although antibiotic therapy for possible superinfection with <em>S. aureus</em> may be indicated, incision and drainage should <strong>not</strong> be performed.

In addition to erythema, swelling, and pain, herpetic whitlow is characterized by the presence of vesicular or pustular lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75510\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75510 \">picture 8</a>). Patients may also experience fever, lymphadenitis, and epitrochlear or axillary lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;, section on 'Other cutaneous manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of herpetic whitlow is suspected by an exposure history as well as the presence of vesicles that, on Tzanck smear, reveal multinucleated giant cells. It is important to distinguish whitlow from felon; incision and drainage should not be performed in the former because it may lead to secondary bacterial infections that delay healing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paronychia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paronychia&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hidradenitis suppurativa</strong> &ndash; Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease affecting the apocrine glands. It should be considered in any patient who presents with recurrent furunculosis of the groin, buttocks, and axillae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77990\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77990 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65884 \">picture 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65188 \">picture 11</a>). Hidradenitis suppurativa may be associated with multiple and recurrent skin abscesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexually transmitted disease</strong> &ndash; Several sexually transmitted diseases may present with a genital ulcer and matted suppurative inguinal lymph nodes including granuloma inguinale, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Diagnosis may require specialized testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with genital ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Botryomycosis</strong> &ndash; Botryomycosis, also known as bacterial pseudomycosis, is a chronic, suppurative infection characterized by a granulomatous inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76152\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76152 \">picture 12</a>). Its name came from the erroneous presumption that it was a fungal infection. The most common organism identified in botryomycosis lesions is <em>S. aureus</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botryomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Botryomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sporotrichosis</strong> &ndash; Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis is the most common form of sporotrichosis seen in clinical practice. Days to weeks after cutaneous inoculation of the fungus, a papule develops at the site of inoculation. This primary lesion usually ulcerates but may remain nodular with overlying erythema; drainage from the lesion is not grossly purulent and has no odor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65985%7EID%2F50115\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65985 graphicRef50115 \">picture 13A-B</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cat scratch disease&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cat-scratch-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cat scratch disease&quot;, section on 'Lymphadenopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 2 percent of emergency department visits are for the evaluation of skin abscesses. Most lesions are caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and many of these patients undergo incision and drainage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1151565097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.) </p><p>Most patients with skin abscesses should undergo incision and drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In patients with small abscesses that are spontaneously draining, the clinician may choose to observe for resolution.</p><p>Needle aspiration is insufficient for adequate abscess drainage. As an example, in an unblinded trial of incision and drainage versus ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of cutaneous abscesses in 101 adults, incision and drainage was much more likely to successfully resolve an abscess at seven days when compared to needle aspiration (80 versus 26 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Observed patients may be treated with oral antibiotics that have activity against methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), depending upon the clinical scenario and the local prevalence of MRSA. The role of antibiotics in skin abscesses and the management of abscesses infected with MRSA are discussed separately.

Large abscesses (&gt;5 cm by palpation or ultrasound) may be best managed by surgery. Mycotic abscesses should <strong>not</strong> be treated with incision and drainage.

Ultrasound may be a useful adjunct for determining which patients with cellulitis also have a subcutaneous abscess or multiple connected abscesses (a contraindication to simple incision and drainage which does not provide adequate treatment of fistulas) and, rarely, may identify abnormalities (eg, adjacent vessels or atypical findings suggesting an alternative diagnosis) that contraindicate simple incision and drainage in the emergency department (ED) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that, when performed by clinicians with proper training, bedside ultrasound identifies the presence of an abscess more accurately than clinical assessment alone and can guide incision and drainage in patients with abscesses that are not clinically evident (eg, no drainage or fluctuance). Observational studies in children and adults suggest that ultrasound can identify the presence of an abscess with superior sensitivity and specificity when compared with clinical assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/1,13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,15-17</a>]. Use of bedside ultrasound may change clinical management by either detecting a subclinical abscess or avoiding an unnecessary procedure in approximately 20 percent of patients. In one small observational study of abscess drainage in 40 adults, detection of an abscess with ultrasound was more predictive of the presence of pus during incision and drainage than clinical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, bedside ultrasound may be most helpful when the presence of an abscess is not clinically evident (eg, no drainage or fluctuance). As an example, in a prospective observational study of 387 children younger than 19 years of age with skin and soft tissue infections undergoing evaluation in a children&rsquo;s hospital ED, bedside ultrasound had a much higher sensitivity and specificity than clinical examination for the 159 children in whom abscesses were not clinically evident (sensitivity 78 versus 44 percent, specificity 61 versus 42 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-of-incision-and-drainage-for-skin-abscess/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. By contrast, bedside ultrasound did not significantly change the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of clinically evident abscesses when compared to physical examination (sensitivity 93 versus 95 percent and specificity 81 versus 84 percent, respectively). The prevalence of abscesses in this study was approximately 60 percent. However, it remains unclear whether ultrasound leads to unnecessary interventions for subclinical abscesses and further study is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3109915266\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocarditis prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who are at risk for bacterial endocarditis (eg, patients with unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, prosthetic valves, central line, or rheumatic heart disease) antibiotic prophylaxis with activity against staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci is warranted prior to incision and drainage.

Most patients can receive appropriate sedation and analgesia in the ED. Local anesthesia is sufficient for most simple abscesses in adolescents and adults. Young children and patients with large abscesses, especially those in the pilonidal region, frequently require parenteral sedation and analgesia in addition to local anesthesia to achieve adequate pain control and to permit successful completion of the procedure.
