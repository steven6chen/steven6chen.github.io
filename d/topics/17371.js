It is characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia (weakness of the eye muscles) and is caused by an idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus. This syndrome was first described in 1954, and its exquisite responsiveness to glucocorticoid treatment was recognized a few years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>While considered a benign condition, permanent neurologic deficits can occur, and relapses are common, often requiring prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome must be carefully differentiated from more malignant diagnoses, a mandate challenged by the lack of a specific diagnostic test abnormality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is caused by an inflammatory process of unknown etiology. On histopathology, there is a nonspecific inflammation of the septa and wall of the cavernous sinus, with a lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration, giant cell granulomas, and proliferation of fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The inflammation produces pressure and secondary dysfunction of the structures within the cavernous sinus, including cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, as well as the superior divisions of cranial nerve V.</p><p>While reports of intracranial extension of the inflammation exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], there are no reports of systemic involvement. Cases of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome have been reported in patients with other inflammatory disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but this may simply represent an association of the two autoimmune conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cases of orbital inflammation may be the initial presentation of systemic inflammatory disorders such as sarcoidosis and Wegener's granulomatosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77825 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is described as &quot;episodic orbital pain associated with paralysis of one or more of the third, fourth, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sixth cranial nerves which usually resolves spontaneously but tends to relapse and remit&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Patients may present at any age, from the first through the eighth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Men and women are affected at the same frequency.</p><p>Patients report a constant pain behind the eye that may begin several days (up to 30 days) prior to the ophthalmoplegia; in one series the median time interval between onset of pain and cranial nerve palsy was two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. The pain is characteristically described as a steady gnawing or boring pain. </p><p>Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is typically unilateral; bilateral symptoms occur in 4 to 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Diplopia results from cranial mono- or polyneuropathy. Involvement of cranial nerve III is reported most frequently (85 percent), followed by cranial nerve VI (70 percent), the ophthalmic division of cranial nerve V (30 percent), and cranial nerve IV (29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Involvement of periarterial sympathetic fibers causes a third order Horner syndrome in approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=horner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Horner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In conjunction with ophthalmoplegia, the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the fifth nerve, the optic nerve, and the facial nerve have also been affected in individual cases, suggesting that inflammation extends beyond the cavernous sinus in rare cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/3,4,10,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,10,13-16</a>]. Involvement of the optic nerve occurs at the orbital apex and may cause optic disc edema or pallor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Loss of visual acuity is uncommon but may occur unpredictably and may be permanent.</p><p>Left untreated, symptoms of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome may resolve spontaneously after an average of about eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients (greater than 75 percent) who present with painful ophthalmoplegia will not have Tolosa-Hunt syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The syndrome of painful ophthalmoplegia may be caused by any process exerting a mass effect on the cavernous sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77825 \">table 1</a>). These include a primary intracranial tumor, lymphoma or other local or distant metastatic tumors, aneurysm, carotid-cavernous fistula, carotid dissection, cavernous sinus thrombosis, infection, vasculitis, and sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/6,7,9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9,19</a>]. Of these conditions, tumors and vascular conditions are the most common. Many of these conditions can be identified by magnetic resonance imaging. </p><p>In addition to these structural compressive lesions, painful ophthalmoplegia can also be caused by ophthalmoplegic migraine, giant cell arteritis, or a diabetic cranial nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Orbital pseudotumor is a related condition of idiopathic inflammation involving the orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients present with painful ophthalmoplegia and orbital signs (proptosis, conjunctival injection, and chemosis). This condition, which is also glucocorticoid responsive, may be identical to Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, distinguished only by a different anatomic localization. Therefore, distinguishing between this syndrome and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is less important than excluding other causes of painful ophthalmoplegia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77825 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>In general, it is difficult to exclude alternative diagnoses by clinical features alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Neuroimaging and other diagnostic tests are generally required. Authors note that either a sudden or a gradual onset of symptoms can be observed in patients with aneurysm, tumor, as well as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other clinical signs may be suggestive but are not completely reliable. Signs of orbital congestion (proptosis, conjunctival injection, and chemosis) usually accompany cavernous sinus thrombosis and diseases involving the orbit. Diabetic ophthalmoplegia usually results from a mononeuropathy rather than a polyneuropathy. Fever suggests infection but may not be present in patients with more indolent pathogens. Another report emphasized that other clinical features atypical for Tolosa-Hunt suggest alternative diagnoses. Such atypical features included ophthalmoplegia preceding the onset of pain, bilateral symptoms, and hemicranial rather than orbital pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is based upon the clinical presentation in conjunction with neuroimaging results and a clinical response to corticosteroids. Laboratory tests and lumbar puncture are also recommended.

However, the specificity is low (50 percent in one series); unless atypical clinical and radiologic findings are used to exclude the diagnosis.

In patients with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, MRI findings can include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/12,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement of the cavernous sinus with abnormal tissue that is usually isointense to gray matter on T1 and iso- or hypointense on T2, and strongly enhances with gadolinium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal convexity of the wall of the cavernous sinus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal narrowing of the intracavernous internal carotid artery</p><p/><p>In rare cases of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, the MRI is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

MRI findings in some of these disorders may also respond to glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p>When MRI suggests a vascular anomaly, an angiographic study (MR angiography, CT angiography, digital subtraction angiography) is usually required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood and CSF evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the MRI is normal or shows changes consistent with cavernous sinus inflammation, further evaluation should include blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing to exclude other possible causes of orbital inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Although case reports of elevated ESR, mild leukocytosis, and antinuclear antibody concentrations have been reported in Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, these should suggest an underlying connective tissue disorder.</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid should also be evaluated for protein, glucose, cell count with differential, cytology, Lyme and syphilis serology, angiotensin converting enzyme (for sarcoidosis), and cultures for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. The expected findings in Tolosa-Hunt syndrome are normal. Mildly raised protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild pleocytosis have been reported, but if found, these should suggest alternative diagnoses (neoplasm, inflammatory or infectious meningitis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to glucocorticoids and further investigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid administration has diagnostic as well as therapeutic utility. Rapid resolution of pain (within 24 to 72 hours) helps to confirm suspected Tolosa-Hunt syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/4,8,9,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9,30</a>]. Improvement of cranial nerve deficits and regression of MRI abnormalities over the next two to eight weeks provide further confirmation of the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/11,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31</a>]. However, an initial clinical or MRI response to steroids is not diagnostic; other entities, such as lymphoma and vasculitis, may also respond clinically and radiographically to glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The clinician needs to be vigilant regarding the continued possibility of misdiagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below). More aggressive testing, including repeat CSF evaluation and consideration of surgical biopsy, is recommended if symptoms do not respond promptly to steroids, or if glucocorticoid efficacy is lost after an initial response.</p><p>Even with careful adherence to clinical criteria and diagnostic evaluation, misdiagnosis still occurs. As an example, a case of painful ophthalmoplegia with characteristic clinical and MRI findings, both initially glucocorticoid responsive, was subsequently demonstrated to be caused by actinomycosis infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. An underlying neoplasm was finally diagnosed in other patients who either failed to respond to initial glucocorticoid therapy or did not maintain a clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/11,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids have been the recommended treatment for Tolosa-Hunt syndrome since the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, there are little data other than case series to determine the most effective dose, route and schedule of administration, or length of glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While glucocorticoids clearly hasten the resolution of orbital pain, there is no definitive evidence that the cranial neuropathies recover any faster with or without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Little consideration has been given to alternative therapies, probably due to the typical rapid response to glucocorticoids.</p><p>Specific glucocorticoid regimens reported for treatment of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome vary, but in general they include initial high-dose glucocorticoids for two to four weeks followed by a gradual taper over a period of at least four to six weeks and up to several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/11,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,36,37</a>]. Prompt administration of IV glucocorticoids is often recommended, but oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is also effective. The rate of the taper should be guided by clinical symptoms, but persistent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings should not deter dose reductions as long as the findings are regressing.</p><p>A suggested glucocorticoid regimen is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> 80 to 100 mg daily for three days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the pain has resolved, taper to 60 mg daily, then 40 mg, then 20 mg, then 10 mg every two weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Close clinical follow-up with repeat MRI every one to two months is necessary to be sure the glucocorticoid treatment remains effective and no evidence of another etiology develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Radiographic improvement often lags several weeks behind clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. In uncomplicated patients, MRI scans to monitor improvement and maintenance of improvement on and then off treatment should be performed every one to two months until findings normalize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tolosa-hunt-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 80 to 100 mg daily for three days. If pain has resolved, we then taper prednisone to 60 mg, then to 40 mg, 20 mg, and 10 mg in two-week intervals. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close clinical and MRI follow-up is essential. We recommend repeating diagnostic investigations and consideration of a surgical biopsy for patients who fail to respond clinically or radiographically to treatment, or who relapse on treatment. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Response to glucocorticoids and further investigation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for most patients is favorable. However, some patients follow a relapsing-remitting course requiring prolonged corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy, and a few have permanent cranial nerve deficits.
