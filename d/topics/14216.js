Sufficient nutritional support including energy and protein intake is essential for normal growth, particularly for infants in whom growth is most sensitive to energy intake. Successful nutritional management requires a multidisciplinary team that includes clinicians, skilled nurses, and dieticians.</p><p>The energy intake should be 100 percent of the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) based on age and gender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56276 \">table 2</a>). Protein intake should be between 100 to 140 percent of DRI based on age and gender for children with CKD stages 3a and 3b and between 100 and 120 percent for those with CKD stages 4 and 5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81506 \">table 3</a>). In patients undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD), protein intake should be increased to compensate for protein losses in the dialysate. The aim is to maintain a normal serum albumin and a urea below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> as far as possible. A more detailed discussion on energy and protein intake requirements in children with CKD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Nutrition'</a>.)</p><p>Enteral feeding is indicated in children with CKD when spontaneous calorie intake is insufficient to maintain growth. Routes for enteral feeding include gastrostomy and nasogastric tubes. In an observational study of 153 young children (less than 24 months) who commenced peritoneal dialysis (PD), gastrostomy feeding compared with either nasogastric tube feeding or demand feeding was associated with improved linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This finding may be due to decreased episodes of vomiting associated with gastrostomies compared with nasogastric tubes.</p><p>With early initiation of intensive nutritional and medical care including enteral feedings, severe growth failure in infants with CKD can be prevented with catch-up growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In a study from a single center of 101 infants with CKD, intensive nutrition (approximately 90 percent were fed enterally) and early renal transplantation resulted in a mean normal adult height in patients without comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>However, even optimal nutritional management may not be able to prevent growth failure in many patients, particularly older children with advanced stages of CKD. Analysis of the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) database showed that catch-up growth without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH) therapy was only observed in children aged younger than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These results demonstrate that other factors such as disturbances of growth hormone (GH) metabolism and its primary mediator, insulin-like growth hormone-I <span class=\"nowrap\">(GH/IGF-I</span> axis), are important contributors to impaired growth in children with CKD, which optimal nutrition alone cannot overcome. As a result, rhGH therapy has been a beneficial intervention in these patients.

At most, a growth pattern parallel to the growth percentiles is observed in response to optimization of nutritional support and medical treatment in children with CKD beyond infancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11199014\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once children have reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD; ie, stage 5 CKD), growth rates generally continue to deteriorate. In particular, patients who receive chronic dialysis are at risk for growth failure. Although dialysis attenuates the uremic state, longitudinal growth is not usually improved and long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis are associated with a gradual loss of standardized height in children and adolescents, which can be a loss of one standard deviation (SD) of height per year in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Children on dialysis who maintain some residual renal function have the best growth; indeed, residual renal function may be a better predictor of longitudinal growth than dialytic clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Even children who undergo renal transplantation and theoretically should have normal growth, and potentially catch-up growth in prepubertal patients, still are at risk for growth impairment, particularly as a result of glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Is the child short?'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359697782\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who undergo long-term conventional hemodialysis (ie, three treatments per week) generally have further deterioration of their growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83843\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83843 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was illustrated by one case series of 51 children who underwent conventional hemodialysis for 12 to 111 months that reported a 0.4 SD annual loss of mean relative height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this study, one-third of the patients grew along the growth percentile attained at initiation of dialysis, one-third had slightly retarded growth, and one-third had severely retarded growth.</p><p>With increased intensity of nutrition and hemodialysis (eg, hemodiafiltration six times per week or nocturnal hemodialysis), single-center studies have reported that the growth rate of children on maintenance hemodialysis improved significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A possible mechanism behind this finding is that intensified dialysis improves clearance of solutes, middle molecules, and inflammatory cytokines, and reverses the abnormalities of the growth <span class=\"nowrap\">hormone/insulin-like</span> growth factor-I <span class=\"nowrap\">(GH/IGF-I)</span> axis secondary to CKD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease#H6760083\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis for children with chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Length of dialysis and frequency of sessions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease#H241185873\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis for children with chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Growth'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359697789\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth appears to be better after the start of continuous peritoneal dialysis (PD) in children, especially in those below six years of age after conservative treatment or compared with hemodialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83844\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83844 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. This relative improvement in growth compared with hemodialysis has been partially attributed to the better nutritional status of patients as a consequence of their peritoneal glucose uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. PD is usually more effective in solute and fluid removal than conventional hemodialysis, and improved growth and nutritional status are correlated with increased solute and volume clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, a gradual decline of relative height is frequently observed in children who have undergone long-term PD, indicating that the impact of the dialysis modality on growth diminishes with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These data temper the initial enthusiasm that PD would result in a significant beneficial sustained impact on growth. At best, parallel growth along the child's growth percentile is achieved by PD, but not persistent catch-up growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359697796\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal transplantation is the optimal renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality to prevent and correct growth failure, as a well-functioning allograft restores the physiological conditions required for normal growth. However, growth rates after renal transplantation in children are highly variable and often do not fulfill the expectations of true catch-up growth, which generally is only observed in children less than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-growth-failure-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The main contributing factors to continued growth depression in pediatric renal allograft recipients are glucocorticoid treatment for immunosuppression and reduced graft function. The final height also depends on the age of the child and the severity of the growth failure at time of transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83842 \">figure 3</a>).

This includes early initiation of optimal nutrition for all children with CKD, which may require enteral feeding (eg, gastrostomy and nasogastric feeding) to ensure both adequate energy and protein intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56276 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81506 \">table 3</a>). Other risk factors and their interventions include metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate therapy), electrolyte and fluid abnormalities (replacement of excessive renal losses), renal osteodystrophy (vitamin D and calcium supplementation and phosphate restriction), and anemia (recombinant human erythropoietin).

In children with ESRD, we recommend renal transplantation as the preferred RRT that promotes growth and overall quality of life (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). If transplantation is not an option, modest initial gains in relative height can be achieved with intensive nutritional intervention in children who are treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) or intensive hemodialysis.
