In 2011, 13 percent of adolescents in the United States planned a suicide attempt in the previous year and 8 percent attempted suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although completed suicide is rare, suicide was the second leading cause of death in 2014 among adolescents age 15 to 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation and management of children and adolescents with suicidal ideation and behavior are reviewed here.

We typically screen adolescents for suicidal ideation by directly asking about it (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Asking about suicidal ideation'</a> below) in the context of screening for depression; this approach is consistent with practice guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Alternatively, clinicians can use a self-report screening tool, such as the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) modified for teens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F104030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104030 \">table 1</a>), which screens for depression and as such, includes one item that asks about suicidal ideation. Screening for depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents#H67789792\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening tests in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Depression screening'</a>.)</p><p>However, there is no evidence that routine screening for suicidal ideation in adolescent primary care patients reduces suicide attempts or mortality. Systematic reviews for the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) have concluded that the evidence is insufficient to determine the benefits of screening for suicide risk in the general population of United States adolescents who do not have existing mental disorders or past histories of suicide attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, there is evidence that certain screens for suicidal risk will indeed identify suicidal adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>], but whether that identification translates into improved outcomes has yet to be tested or proven.</p><p>The USPSTF clinical practice guideline for screening for suicide risk, as well as other USPSTF guidelines, can be accessed through the website for the <a href=\"http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/guide/index.html&amp;token=hlrg0v+O+Yzj/2wKtQ8vICdipSwC+Kb3w5gh9xCdBPstinfXYS6pg5GW1LB4++JuSYrpWjWbrEshzA3o+GwQyx8nbn4IYbZs1Eb9Y0zINMMQ9sKxHrRA7AqkaGINHXeW&amp;TOPIC_ID=1230\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1283080365\"><span class=\"h3\">Emergency department</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For youth evaluated in the emergency department by non-mental health clinicians, a brief screening tool may have some value in identifying risk for suicidal behavior. The Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89315\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef89315 \">form 1</a>) is a four-item instrument that clinicians can administer to screen for risk of suicide in patients who present to pediatric emergency departments with psychiatric or general medical complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The four items are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the past few weeks, have you wished you were dead?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the past few weeks, have you felt that you or your family would be better off if you were dead?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the past week, have you been having thoughts about killing yourself?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you ever tried to kill yourself?</p><p/><p>Answering yes to at least one question constitutes a positive screen that should trigger a more extensive evaluation of the patient&rsquo;s risk for suicide. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment of suicidal ideation'</a> below.)</p><p>A cross-sectional study in patients aged 10 to 21 years who presented to pediatric emergency departments with psychiatric (n = 180) or general medical (n = 344) problems found that the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions had good psychometric properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sensitivity was 97 percent and specificity 88 percent. In psychiatric patients, the positive and negative predictive values were 71 and 97 percent; in general medical patients, positive and negative predictive values were 39 and 100 percent. A limitation of the study was that it was cross-sectional rather than assessing true predictive ability. </p><p>A systematic review found that two other screening instruments for suicidal ideation or behavior in high risk adolescents performed poorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Asking about suicidal ideation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic means to identify youth at risk for suicide is to simply ask about risk factors, suicidal thoughts, and intent. The concern that talking or asking about suicide will provoke suicidal ideation or actions in a child or adolescent is not supported by evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. </p><p>Clinicians should interview adolescents with their parents as well as separate from parents, because interviewing patients alone may facilitate a more open discussion about suicidal ideation and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, confidentiality should not be promised since it cannot be maintained under these circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Suicidal ideation or attempt'</a>.)</p><p>Demonstrating that one is comfortable discussing suicide is an important element of an effective inquiry. Toward this end, the questions that are posed should be short, to the point, and asked in a nonjudgmental manner in developmentally appropriate language [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Avoiding abrupt and intrusive questions may help establish rapport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Questions about suicidal ideation are typically asked toward the end of questions about signs and symptoms of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 2</a>). Sample questions about suicide include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you ever think about dying? How often?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What do you think happens when you die?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you ever wished you were dead?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you ever think the world would be better off if you were dead? Do you think life would be easier for your family and friends if you were dead? Have you ever thought of what would have to happen for your life to end?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you had thoughts about hurting yourself? Killing yourself?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you ever tried to kill yourself?</p><p/><p>If the child or adolescent begins talking about suicidal thoughts, the lines of communication must be kept open. This can be facilitated through active listening, patience, maintenance of a calm demeanor, and neither minimizing the patient's concerns nor reacting with disapproval. The natural tendency to be reassuring and optimistic must be inhibited. Attempts to talk the child or adolescent out of suicide should be avoided, as should discussions of whether suicide is right or wrong. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk assessment of suicidal ideation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a child or adolescent has disclosed suicidal ideation, prompt assessment of suicidal risk is in order. Assessing the risk for suicide in youth with suicidal ideation includes evaluation of multiple elements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54465%7EPEDS%2F67228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54465 graphicRef67228 \">table 3A-B</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Content and chronicity of the suicidal thoughts </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Existence and details of a suicide plan </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to the means described in the plan </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The level of intent (eg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really gonna do it&rdquo;) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stressors, emotional pain, behavioral regulation, and social support </p><p/><p>Other factors to assess include substance abuse, functional impairment, and lack of developmental progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Risk assessment information should be obtained from the parents or guardians, as well as the child or adolescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additional sources include medical records, school reports, therapists and behavioral staff, and other individuals who are close to the child or adolescent. Collateral information is necessary because the patient may have reason to provide inaccurate information (eg, to avoid hospitalization). </p><p>Risk for suicide should be considered high in patients who report active suicidal ideation (eg, &ldquo;I want to kill myself&rdquo;) with a specific plan or intent and have access to lethal means. The clearer the intent, the higher the risk, particularly in the context of disinhibition (eg, impulsivity or intoxication) and access to lethal means.</p><p>Nevertheless, passive suicidal ideation (eg, &ldquo;I wish I would get run over by a car&rdquo;) should not be ignored. Passive suicidal ideation can progress to active suicidal ideation with a plan (eg, running into traffic).</p><p>As part of the evaluation, clinicians should ask patients whether they can promise to maintain their safety and not harm themselves; clinicians should also discuss a safety plan that specifies how patients can cope with recurrent suicidal urges in the future (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F110846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110846 \">figure 1</a>).The safety plan is a widely used therapeutic tool, but in addition, the extent to which the adolescent can commit to stay safe and use the safety plan provides additional information about the adolescent&rsquo;s risk for suicidal behavior. </p><p>Nevertheless, patients who agree to adhere to a safety plan may still be at high risk; this agreement does not protect patients or clinicians, and is not a substitute for thorough evaluation, sound clinical judgment, and meaningful therapeutic interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], particularly with impulsive adolescents. Best clinical practice now avoids the terminology of no-suicide contracts (&ldquo;contracting for safety&rdquo;), in which patients commit to stay safe; rather, best practice focuses upon generating a safety plan. Relying solely upon no-suicide contracts in the absence of a safety plan has not been shown to be efficacious, although in some cases these contracts may help foster a therapeutic alliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral/intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some pediatricians have the requisite training and experience to manage patients with suicidal ideation, most patients are referred to psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians if these specialists are available. In particular, patients at moderate to high risk (eg, active suicidal ideation with a plan, or any <span class=\"nowrap\">recent/current</span> suicidal behavior) should be referred for a mental health evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Primary care clinicians who refer patients to specialists are encouraged to remain involved in management. Pediatricians can help educate patients and families about treatment and reinforce the need for adherence.</p><p>When children or adolescents are in an acute suicidal crisis due to thoughts of wanting to kill themselves, the focus of the intervention is to keep them safe until the suicidal state diminishes or abates. This usually involves working with the family or other supportive individuals who can address safety concerns (eg, remove access to means) and are willing to stay with the patient at all times.</p><p>Treatment options include hospitalization, medication for underlying psychiatric disorders such as major depression, more frequent psychological intervention, mobilizing supports, and access to crisis intervention services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The level of intervention depends upon the level of suicide risk (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment of suicidal ideation'</a> above), available support, and the ability of patients to join with those who seek to keep them safe: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate psychiatric evaluation (through the emergency department or psychiatry crisis clinic) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalization is indicated when there is an imminent risk of suicide (eg, an active plan or intent without solid support or psychiatric intervention already in place to maintain safety) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3,12,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,19-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt referral to a mental health professional who is readily available (eg, within a few days) is warranted if the risk is not imminent. </p><p/><p>The confidentiality of adolescents who are at risk to harm themselves must be breached in deference to patient safety; safety trumps confidentiality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EMERGENCY EVALUATION OF SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents with suicidal behavior are typically evaluated in an emergency department. Medical stabilization is the first priority.

At the assessment 18 months post-enrollment, usual care plus psychotherapy was superior to usual care alone with regard to suicide attempts (5 versus 35 percent), hospitalization (16 versus 53 percent), and arrest by legal authorities (5 versus 41 percent).

Dialectical behavior therapy included weekly sessions of individual therapy, weekly multifamily group sessions addressing skill deficits, and family therapy sessions as indicated. Usual care included at least one weekly individual therapy session (eg, psychodynamically-oriented therapy or CBT). Pharmacotherapy was allowed in both groups. The mean number of self-harm episodes (both nonsuicidal self-harm and suicide attempts) was less in patients treated with dialectical behavior therapy than usual care (9 versus 23 episodes). Posttreatment, a prospective one-year follow-up assessment found that the benefit of dialectical behavior therapy persisted, such that the average number of self-harm episodes was less in the group that received dialectical behavior therapy than usual care (6 versus 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Family therapy (four sessions, each lasting two hours) was provided in a single family format to only the parents, and focused upon education about self-injurious behavior and adolescent development, and strategies to manage stress and family conflicts and promote adolescent self-esteem and family harmony. Reduction of suicidal ideation and behavior and other psychiatric symptoms was greater in patients whose parents received family therapy, and the benefits persisted at the six-month follow-up. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 12-week trial compared attachment-based family therapy (average of 10 sessions) to usual clinical management (average of 3 sessions) in 66 mostly poor and minority adolescents with suicidal ideation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Group psychotherapy in all three trials was administered according to the same treatment manual and included elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. At the 12-month assessment, repetition of self-harm in the two groups was comparable. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22366297\"><span class=\"h3\">Mentalization based therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mentalization based therapy appears to reduce adolescent self-harm. A one-year randomized trial compared mentalization based therapy with usual care (mental health services) in adolescents (n = 80) who presented with self-harm; allocation was concealed from patients and outcome assessors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Mentalization based therapy is a form of psychodynamic psychotherapy that focuses upon impulsivity and affect regulation; treatment was administered in weekly individual sessions and monthly family therapy. Nearly all of the adolescents suffered from depressive syndromes and most also suffered from borderline personality disorder. Subsequent self-harm occurred in fewer adolescents who received mentalization based therapy than controls (43 versus 68 percent). In addition, reduction of depressive and borderline symptoms was greater with active treatment. Mentalization appeared to improve self-harm outcomes by improving the quality of attachment between adolescents and their parents, and by improving the ability to mentalize, that is, to conceptualize actions in terms of thoughts and feelings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282807673\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emergent administration of antidepressants has no role in the acute management of the suicidal adolescent or child. However, many pediatric patients hospitalized for suicidal ideation or behavior are treated with pharmacotherapy for an underlying psychiatric disorder. As an example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often used for unipolar major depression, based upon efficacy and tolerability. All medications that are prescribed for the suicidal child must be monitored and any changes in behavior or side effects must be reported immediately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although there is some concern that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidality in pediatric patients, this remains an area of significant controversy, and the consensus among most mental health specialists is that the benefits of antidepressant therapy outweigh the risks.

The youth awareness program trained students to recognize depression and suicidality in themselves and other students, and encouraged adaptive coping and help-seeking; the program included three hours of role play sessions, two hours of interactive lectures, and a 32-page booklet that students could take home. Gatekeeper training taught teachers to recognize suicidality in students. Screening of students was conducted by health professionals, who referred students at risk for suicide to clinical services. During follow-up lasting 12 months, fewer suicide attempts occurred in the youth awareness program than the control condition (0.7 versus 1.5 percent of adolescents). By contrast, the number of suicide attempts was comparable in the gatekeeper, screening, and control groups. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H187952711\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNITY BASED PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited evidence suggests that short term community based interventions may temporarily reduce suicide attempts and mortality in youth.

This short-term program includes various approaches, such as gatekeeper training, which involves training individuals such as teachers and primary care physicians to identify youth at risk for suicide and to refer them for help. The program also includes education, screening, and crisis hotlines. A retrospective observational study examined suicide attempts in youth (age 16 to 23 years of age; n = approximately 57,000) living in communities that implemented the program, and youth (n = approximately 84,000) living in communities that did not implement the program (control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The active intervention was associated with fewer suicide attempts in the first year after implementation of the program (5 fewer attempts per 1000 youth, for an estimated total of more than 79,000 attempts nationwide). However, the rate of suicide attempts in the two groups beyond one year was comparable. Similarly, suicide mortality in the active intervention group was reduced in the first year after implementing the program (1 less death per 100,000 youth, for an estimated total of 427 fewer deaths nationwide); however, this benefit was not sustained beyond one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The findings suggest that suicide prevention requires continuous efforts over time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H589435932\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and warning signs'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically screen adolescent primary care patients for suicidal ideation by directly asking about it in the context of screening for depression. Alternatively, clinicians can use the self-report, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) modified for teens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F104030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104030 \">table 1</a>), which screens for depression and includes one item that asks about suicidal ideation. For youth who present to pediatric emergency departments with psychiatric or general medical complaints, the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89315\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef89315 \">form 1</a>) is a four-item instrument that may have some value in identifying risk for suicidal behavior. (See <a href=\"#H252407454\" class=\"local\">'Screening for suicidal ideation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessing the risk of suicide in youth with suicidal ideation includes evaluation of multiple elements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54465%7EPEDS%2F67228\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54465 graphicRef67228 \">table 3A-B</a>), including the content and chronicity of the suicidal thoughts, existence and details of a suicide plan, access to the means described in the plan, and level of intent to commit suicide. Clinicians should also obtain collateral information from the parents. Risk for suicide should be considered high in patients who report active suicidal ideation (eg, &ldquo;I want to kill myself&rdquo;) with a specific plan or intent and have access to lethal means. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment of suicidal ideation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Psychiatric evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric patients with suicidal behavior are typically evaluated in an emergency department. Medical stabilization is the first priority. Patients should be under constant observation until the seriousness of their intent is assessed, and potentially harmful medical supplies and equipment should be removed from the examination room where patients are evaluated. To discourage elopement, hospital gowns should be provided to patients and their clothing and belongings should be stored separately. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Emergency evaluation of suicidal behavior'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disposition of suicidal children or adolescents from the emergency department or medical care depends upon the immediate risk of suicide. Patients should not be discharged from medical care until their account of events has been verified by their caregiver(s). Psychiatric hospitalization (inpatient or partial) for evaluation and initiation of therapy is nearly always indicated for children and adolescents with suicidal behavior or immediate high risk of suicide. Disposition to outpatient therapy is contingent upon a safety plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F110846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110846 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pediatric patients with suicidal behavior, we recommend psychotherapy rather than usual care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Effective options include cognitive-behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, family therapy, and mentalization based therapy. (See <a href=\"#H282807842\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General principles for managing suicidal children and adolescents with psychotherapy include the following: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Address family interactions or increase nonfamilial support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide a sufficient number of treatment sessions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Target alcohol and substance abuse when clinically indicated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discuss motivation for treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initiate treatment quickly and at a greater intensity when suicidal crises recur</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coordinate treatment administered by multiple clinicians. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">(See <a href=\"#H3869465895\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The emergent administration of antidepressants has no role in the acute management of the suicidal adolescent or child. However, many pediatric patients hospitalized for suicidal ideation or behavior are treated with pharmacotherapy for an underlying psychiatric disorder. (See <a href=\"#H282807673\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention programs that are administered in schools can reduce suicide attempts in students, and community based interventions may temporarily reduce suicide attempts and mortality in youth.
