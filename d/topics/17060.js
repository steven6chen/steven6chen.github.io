In 1999, glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-estimating equations started to replace serum creatinine for the evaluation of kidney function. Since that time, more and more older adults have been identified as having acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the prevalence of diagnosed kidney disease in this population has increased. About half of adults over the age of 70 years now have a measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, a threshold often used to diagnose CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This higher prevalence of diagnosed CKD is not simply due to increased recognition of diseases that tend to cluster in older adults, such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive small-vessel vasculitis, amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy, and tubulointerstitial disorders. Rather, much of the increased rate of CKD diagnoses in the elderly population results from the normal structural and functional changes that occur in the kidney with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many have argued that this increased recognition of CKD is a positive development and leads to better care in elderly populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Others have argued that this is a harmful development that has led to unnecessary labeling of far too many older patients as &quot;diseased&quot; without any proven clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>This review describes the structural and functional changes in the kidney with normal aging and the clinical significance of these changes. Issues related to estimation of GFR, the definition of CKD, and evaluation of patients with CKD are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530763\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL AGING VERSUS CHRONIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging is a natural and inevitable biological process that results in structural and functional changes in many organ systems. The kidney systematically loses function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) with age. In addition to specific kidney diseases that are common in older adults, such as diabetic nephropathy, physiological senescence of the kidney occurs, even with healthy aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A similar process occurs in the lung, which systematically loses function (ie, forced expiratory volume in one second), even among &quot;healthy&quot; adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting reference values for pulmonary function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish the structural and functional changes of a kidney affected by a specific preventable or treatable disease from those of a kidney undergoing the inevitable consequences of aging. However, even if the reduction in function is not preventable or treatable, senescent changes in the kidney are relevant and important to managing older patients. Specifically, loss of renal reserves with aging has the following clinical significance (see <a href=\"#H9530922\" class=\"local\">'Clinical significance of the aging kidney'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More advanced disease if a new specific nephropathy, such as diabetic nephropathy or vasculitis, develops</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased susceptibility to acute kidney injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic accumulation of renally cleared medications </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for age-appropriate criteria in the selection of living kidney donors</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5974750\"><span class=\"h2\">Living kidney donors as a resource to examine normal aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Living kidney donors are a unique and important resource for understanding the structural and functional changes of normal aging. Kidney donors are systematically and meticulously evaluated to confirm &quot;health&quot; or at least &quot;healthy for age&quot; as currently understood. This provides the opportunity to characterize the physiological changes in the kidney with optimal aging. Kidney donors undergo kidney function testing, urinalysis, and contrast computed tomography (CT) angiograms as part of their evaluation. In addition, some transplant centers obtain implantation renal biopsies (ie, &quot;time zero&quot; renal biopsies) at the time of surgical donation. Autopsy studies of the general population (identified by sudden deaths) can also characterize structural changes in the kidney with aging, but they lack simultaneous kidney function and other clinical evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By contrast, general population studies of the aging kidney in living humans rely upon nonspecific biomarkers to evaluate the kidney since structural characteristics of the kidney are not typically available.</p><p>Many examples of studies from living kidney donors are presented in the ensuing discussions of structural and functional changes with aging. (See <a href=\"#H5974756\" class=\"local\">'Structural changes of the kidneys with aging'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9530832\" class=\"local\">'Functional changes of the kidneys with aging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5974756\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURAL CHANGES OF THE KIDNEYS WITH AGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various structural changes occur with aging, including micro-anatomic changes, such as nephrosclerosis and a decline in nephron number, and macro-anatomic changes, such as decreased kidney cortical volume and the development of renal cysts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530769\"><span class=\"h2\">Micro-anatomical changes of the kidneys with aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major micro-anatomical changes that occur with aging are nephrosclerosis and nephron hypertrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530776\"><span class=\"h3\">Nephrosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary structural finding of the aging kidney on light microscopy is nephrosclerosis, characterized by an increased detection of focal and global glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and fibrointimal hyperplasia (arteriosclerosis). In a study of kidney transplant donors, nephrosclerosis, defined as the combination of two or more of glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, or arteriosclerosis, increased from 2.7 percent in kidneys from 18- to 29-year-olds to 73 percent in kidneys from 70- to 77-year-olds. The difference in nephrosclerosis comparing two kidneys separated in age by eight years was roughly equivalent to the difference in nephrosclerosis comparing a kidney from a hypertensive donor with a similarly aged nonhypertensive donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Nephrosclerosis is due to an ischemic injury of the nephrons that is thought to result from arteriosclerosis and hyalinosis of small arteries. With ischemic injury, the glomerulus develops wrinkled capillary tufts, thickened basement membranes, and pericapsular fibrosis, eventually leading to collapse of the tuft and a diminutive, globally sclerosed glomerulus with collagen deposition filling Bowman's space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Some of these obsolescent glomeruli may subsequently undergo complete absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The tubule associated with the sclerotic glomerulus also atrophies, and the interstitium surrounding the atrophic tubule undergoes fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/7,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,15</a>]. Glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis on biopsy of kidney donors correlate with the presence of arteriosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2585245809\"><span class=\"h3\">Glomerulosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The focal and global sclerosis of aging has been described in a variety of populations, including living kidney donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/7,11,13,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,13,15-18</a>]. There is reduction in podocyte density throughout life that may also cause glomerular tuft collapse and contribute to age-related glomerulosclerosis via a nonischemic pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The upper reference limit (95<sup>th</sup> percentile) for the number of globally sclerotic glomeruli expected on biopsy according to age was determined in 1847 normotensive living kidney donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a kidney biopsy showing 20 glomeruli, for example, up to 1 glomerulus would be expected to be globally sclerotic in a 25-year-old, but up to 6 would be expected to be globally sclerotic in a 75-year-old.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555989155\"><span class=\"h3\">Nephron number in aging kidneys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of functional nephrons with which a person is born (ie, nephron endowment) varies between 700,000 and 1.8 million per kidney, and the number progressively declines with aging due to nephrosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. As glomeruli sclerose with aging, there appears to be eventual absorption of these sclerosed glomeruli, and the total number of sclerosed and non-sclerosed glomeruli declines with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Low nephron endowment associated with low birth weight may accelerate the age-related decline in functional nephrons in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530782\"><span class=\"h3\">Nephron hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephron size (both glomerulus and tubule) increases in a variety of metabolic risk states, including obesity and diabetes, due to cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In parallel with age-related glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], hypertrophy of the remaining functional nephrons also occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. However, whether glomerular hypertrophy, in particular, is a consequence of normal aging is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/12,13,18,21,31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,18,21,31,35</a>]. As an example, a study in 1395 living kidney donors found no evidence of larger glomeruli with older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. By contrast, another study of 89 living donors, deceased older donors, and older tumor nephrectomy patients reported an association of age with larger glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is possible that, while healthy aging might not induce glomerular hypertrophy, age-related accumulation of comorbid conditions may be associated with glomerular hypertrophy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530788\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microdissection of nephrons from autopsied kidneys shows a strong association between aging and frequency of tubular diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530794\"><span class=\"h2\">Macro-anatomical changes of the kidneys with aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major macro-anatomical changes that occur with aging include a reduction in cortical volume and the appearance of renal cysts and tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530802\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic imaging studies have elucidated the age-related changes in the kidney volume. A decline in total kidney volume with aging was noted in clinical populations using ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. In one study, the rate of age-related decline was significantly faster in patients with underlying atherosclerosis (estimated from carotid intima-media thickness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. By contrast, other studies in living kidney donors failed to detect a decline in kidney volume with age, but these studies had small sample sizes and included few older donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/32,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,40,41</a>]. </p><p>In a large study of 1344 potential kidney donors, kidney parenchymal volume was stable before age 50 years but declined after age 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This study also separately measured the kidney cortical and medullary volumes. Cortical volume declined throughout the adult age spectrum in both men and women, but with an accelerated rate of decline after age 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. By contrast, medullary volume increased with age in both men and women until age 50 years, after which it declined in women and remained static in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Renal sinus fat increases with age; this could have masked some of the decline in kidney parenchymal volume with aging in studies that included sinus fat in kidney volume or weight measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530808\"><span class=\"h4\">Micro-anatomical connections to kidney volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age-related decline in kidney cortical volume is largely due to underlying nephrosclerosis (senescent global glomerulosclerosis and atrophy of tubules are lesions that decrease the volume occupied by nephrons). Some of the preservation of kidney parenchymal volume with aging can be explained by compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining functional nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/13,31,33,35,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31,33,35,43</a>]. Increased medullary volume with aging can be explained by hypertrophy of tubules attached to juxtamedullary glomeruli in compensation for atrophy (glomerulosclerosis and nephrosclerosis) of the more superficial nephrons in the cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There appears to be a more accelerated loss of total kidney parenchymal volume after middle age (approximately 50 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/3,42,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,42,45-47</a>]. This may be the point at which hypertrophy of functional nephrons no longer compensates for the volume lost from sclerosed and atrophied nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530814\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal cysts and tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal parenchymal cysts become more common, more numerous, and larger with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Age-related diverticula in renal tubules are the precursor lesion to these renal cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Because of this age-related increase in renal cysts, the diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with renal ultrasound imaging requires age-specific criteria (Ravine criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. CT scans have higher resolution and can detect smaller cysts not seen by ultrasound. The figure shows the upper limit of normal (97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile) for the number of cortical and medullary cysts detected by CT according to age and gender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91443 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Although renal cysts that are not associated with malignancy or a polycystic disorder are often called &quot;benign&quot; or &quot;simple,&quot; they frequently reflect chronic underlying parenchymal injury of the aging kidney and are associated with increased urine albumin excretion. In addition to parenchymal simple renal cysts, other renal cysts are also more common with aging, including parapelvic renal cysts (due to lymphatic dilation near the renal sinus), hyperdense cysts, angiomyolipomas, and malignant cysts or tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530820\"><span class=\"h3\">Other structural changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atherosclerosis of renal arteries (with or without significant stenosis) is more prevalent in older individuals, ranging from 0.4 percent in 18- to 29-year-olds to 25 percent in 60- to 75-year-olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) also becomes more prevalent with aging, though it is much more common in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, parenchymal calcifications and cortical scars (a focal atrophic region of cortex) are more common with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530832\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THE KIDNEYS WITH AGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the primary tool for assessing age-related functional changes in the kidney and is typically the only tool for examining age-related changes since kidney biopsy and renal imaging are not typically justified in routine patient care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530838\"><span class=\"h2\">GFR declines with normal aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rates of GFR decline with aging follow a fairly normal (Gaussian) distribution, suggesting that it is primarily driven by a physiological process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Not only does the lower reference limit for GFR decrease with age, but the upper reference limit also decreases with age, consistent with a universal or near-universal decline in kidney function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91445 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. As an example, a longitudinal study of 254 men followed for 23 years found that the average GFR (estimated serially by urinary creatinine clearance) declined by 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Some of these individuals had diabetes or obesity, which could have impacted the results, and in fact, one-third of the cohort had an increase in their creatinine clearance over time, which likely reflected both hyperfiltration (seen with obesity, early diabetes, and subclinical cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]) and imprecision with urinary creatinine clearance measurements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calculation of the creatinine clearance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-hyperfiltration-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some investigators have attributed this GFR decline with normal aging to a high-sodium diet or some other pervasive influences of a &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;Western&quot; lifestyle. However, GFR decline with normal aging is also observed in populations unaffected by Western lifestyle factors. In an isolated population of Kuna Indians in Panama, for example, GFR (measured by inulin clearance) declined by 9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per decade of life, despite not having a Western lifestyle and not having an age-related increase in blood pressure that is typical of a Western lifestyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530851\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanistic basis for GFR decline with aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have suggested that the decline in GFR in aging is primarily driven by a vascular (arterial) process. There has long been evidence of altered responses to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in the aging kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-64</a>]. This is further supported by an increase in the filtration fraction (the fraction of renal blood flow filtered by the glomerulus) and the blunted rise of renal blood flow (but not GFR) in response to an amino acid infusion with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/60,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,65-67</a>]. Detecting a link between GFR decline and nephrosclerosis with aging may be challenging because they may be the same process and universal. Nephrosclerosis on renal biopsy associates with decreased GFR, but not independently of older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cortical atrophy with aging appears to be along the same biological pathway as GFR decline, but there also appear to be factors that contribute to GFR decline in addition to cortical atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In particular, GFR may decline with aging due to a decreased metabolic demand, as reflected by lower urea generation in elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Standardizing GFR to metabolic rate instead of to body surface area attenuates much of the GFR decline with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530864\"><span class=\"h2\">High proportion of older adults with reduced GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines define and stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) by levels of GFR and albuminuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597 \">table 3</a>).

Often, a specific disease process for a GFR reduction to &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> in older adults cannot be identified (other than normal aging).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530870\"><span class=\"h3\">Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct measurement of GFR is not available in most clinical settings. Instead, GFR is usually estimated from serum creatinine (eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub>) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation or the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. As with measured GFR, about half of adults over the age of 70 years have CKD as determined by an eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Creatinine-based GFR-estimating equations include an age variable to model the decline in creatinine generation (due to decreased muscle mass) with normal aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This age variable unmasks the age-related decline in GFR that is not detected by serum creatinine alone. Interestingly, the age-related decline in GFR is approximately canceled out by the age-related decline in muscle mass, such that serum creatinine remains stable with healthy aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The only way a patient can maintain a stable eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> with aging is to have a progressive decrease in his or her serum creatinine level. However, a declining serum creatinine level can represent loss of muscle mass from a disease process. A patient with a stable serum creatinine level who &quot;ages into CKD&quot; based upon eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> could have experienced nothing more than the expected age-related decline in GFR. Ideally, patients would lose neither GFR nor muscle mass with aging, and serum creatinine levels would still remain stable with aging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4642987\"><span class=\"h3\">When and how to confirm CKD in older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncertainty regarding a reduction in GFR when using eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> may exist when other evidence of CKD such as albuminuria is lacking, or when the muscle mass is more than average for the patient's age. When such uncertainty exists regarding the accuracy of eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub>, a urinary creatinine clearance or direct GFR measurement can further assess the kidney function of older adult patients. This may be particularly important when an accurate GFR assessment is needed for a patient who wants to donate a kidney. (See <a href=\"#H9530959\" class=\"local\">'Living kidney donor evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Older patients in good health and thus with higher-than-average muscle mass may meet the definition of CKD by eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> but may actually have a GFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> using a confirmatory test. This can be reassuring to some older patients who are concerned about being diagnosed with CKD. However, if an older patient's urinary creatinine clearance or direct GFR measurement is still modestly reduced (eg, 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>), it is still possible that this could be nothing more than a reduced GFR from normal aging. (See <a href=\"#H3423094\" class=\"local\">'What to do with isolated mild reductions in eGFR in older adults'</a> below.)</p><p>When confirmation of CKD is desired, the KDIGO guidelines suggest using GFR-estimating equations that are based upon cystatin C (eGFR<sub>cystatin C</sub>) or upon both creatinine and cystatin C (eGFR<sub>creatinine-cystatin C</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Specifically, they suggest these calculations be made in patients with an eGFR<sub>creatinine </sub>of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and no other markers of kidney damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There is improved discrimination of outcomes (end-stage renal disease [ESRD] and mortality) with eGFR<sub>cystatin C</sub> or eGFR<sub>creatinine-cystatin C</sub> compared with eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the optimal GFR-estimating equation for predicting such outcomes does not necessarily reflect the true association between GFR and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Unlike an elevated serum creatinine, elevated cystatin C occurs with other chronic diseases besides CKD. Cystatin C is a protease inhibitor that plays a role in atherosclerosis, obesity, and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>], and serum cystatin C associates with both CKD risk factors and the development of ESRD, independent of the patient's underlying GFR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91446\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91446 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-81</a>]. Thus, although patients with elevated serum cystatin C have a higher risk for ESRD, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, this risk may be mediated by factors other than kidney function (ie, GFR). As a result, we do not recommend use of eGFR<sub>cystatin C</sub> or eGFR<sub>creatinine-cystatin C</sub> to confirm a diagnosis of CKD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530909\"><span class=\"h3\">Mortality and kidney failure risk with CKD from aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clearly evident that the relationships between eGFR and death or ESRD support the use of a common threshold for CKD in all age groups. A meta-analysis by the CKD Prognosis Consortium studied 46 cohorts with 2,051,244 patients and found that a low eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> was associated with mortality and ESRD in all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. However, several features of this meta-analysis argue that a separate GFR threshold is needed for older adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals without albuminuria, an isolated mild reduction in eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (compared with 75 to 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was associated with a 20 percent higher relative mortality in those 75 years and older, but a 179 percent higher relative mortality in those aged 18 to 54 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lowest risk for mortality in adults aged 18 to 54 years was with an eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> &ge;105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. However, in adults aged 75 years and older, those with an eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> in this range had a 60 percent higher relative mortality. If the separation between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;disease&quot; is based upon risk, as suggested by KDIGO, then age-specific ranges are justified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91447 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the KDIGO guidelines, an eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> &ge;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> is used to define &quot;optimal&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the meta-analysis performed by the CKD Prognosis Consortium to evaluate risks associated with isolated mild reductions in eGFR did not use this &quot;normal&quot; range as the reference group, thereby limiting the use of these data.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8707703\"><span class=\"h2\">Other functional changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The kidneys of older patients demonstrate impaired renal conservation of sodium in response to an acute reduction of sodium intake, as well as impaired ability to rapidly excrete a large sodium load. Animal studies show a decreased abundance of sodium chloride transporters and epithelial sodium channels with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. There is also loss of both the maximum urine concentrating ability (from about 1200 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosm/L)</span> and the maximum urine diluting capacity (from about 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosm/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-87</a>]. The expression of aquaporins is reduced in the medulla with aging in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The reduced diluting capacity of the kidney increases the risk of hyponatremia in older patients, particularly those with a low-protein &quot;tea and toast&quot; diet that is consumed by some older adult patients. Changes in the diluting capacity also contributes to thiazide-associated hyponatremia, which is more common in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530922\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE AGING KIDNEY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several important issues in the management of patients with age-related changes in kidney structure and function. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no proven therapies to halt or reverse age-related declines in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Any therapy aimed at raising the GFR by causing the remaining functional nephrons to filter more may actually be harmful rather than beneficial to the kidney. Hypertrophy and hyperfiltration of functional glomeruli in animals, for example, can lead to further glomerulosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy'</a>.)<br/><br/>This is a key difference distinguishing age-related &quot;chronic kidney disease (CKD)&quot; from other age-related chronic disease such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Age-related hypertension and hyperlipidemia can be reversed, and reducing the blood pressure and cholesterol has clinical benefit in older adult patients. By contrast, generic therapies for CKD (such as angiotensin inhibitors and protein-restricted diets) do not reverse age-related GFR decline, and it is not clear that these therapies are of any benefit to an older adult with only age-related &quot;CKD.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with age-related reductions in GFR require medication dose adjustments. (See <a href=\"#H9530935\" class=\"local\">'Medication dosing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The loss of functioning nephrons associated with normal aging puts older adults at higher risk for acute kidney injury. (See <a href=\"#H9530941\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with aging does <strong>not</strong> substantially improve the assessment of cardiovascular risk over conventional predictors and does <strong>not</strong> indicate a high risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

An eGFR of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> has a modest though statistically significant association with adverse events such as death and ESRD in older adults, leading many experts and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group to endorse an eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for diagnosing CKD regardless of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, many authorities caution against labeling older patients with a stable and normal serum creatinine as having CKD solely based upon an eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> between 45 and 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The major reasons for this caution are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimation of GFR is imprecise and can be inaccurate. A true decrease in GFR in someone with CKD, for example, can be partially cancelled out by a parallel decrease in creatinine generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In addition, the age variable that is included in the estimating equations can inflate the adverse risks attributed to reduced GFR, particularly in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Many problems associated with estimating GFR using estimation equations apply both to younger and older populations; these are presented in detail separately.

The relative risk of mortality is substantially less in older compared with younger patients with an eGFR of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.<sup> </sup>This issue is discussed above in detail. (See <a href=\"#H9530909\" class=\"local\">'Mortality and kidney failure risk with CKD from aging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>There is concern for both over-diagnosis of CKD in older patients with an eGFR below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and under-diagnosis of CKD in younger patients with eGFR above 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, some have suggested using the upper reference limits for serum creatinine (1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women [106.3 and 88.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L,</span> respectively]) to identify those patients who have CKD resulting from GFR reductions that exceed the expected age-related decline. These reference limits are derived using healthy adults in the general population and in healthy kidney donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. The upper reference limits for serum creatinine may be slightly higher in African Americans and slightly lower in Asians, although few studies have assessed reference limits in non-white populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Some have also suggested reporting age-specific lower reference limits for eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub>, which can be calculated from the upper reference limits for serum creatinine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91445 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. However, few studies have assessed reference limits for serum creatinine in elderly populations (&gt;70 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In an elderly patient with an eGFR of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and no albuminuria, we advocate caution in diagnosing CKD (rather than an age-related GFR decline). Approximately half of all older patients will have an eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and the relative risks of ESRD and mortality associated with lower eGFR values are substantially less than in younger patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91447 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530935\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dosing with medications that are excreted by glomerular filtration (typically water-soluble medications) should be adjusted to the patient's GFR as indicated by medication dosing guidelines (typically provided by the manufacturer). Historically, most medication dosing guidelines have been developed using the Cockcroft-Gault equation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-creatinine-clearance-estimate-by-cockcroft-gault-equation-in-adults-and-older-adolescents-age-18-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-creatinine-clearance-estimate-by-cockcroft-gault-equation-in-adults-and-older-adolescents-age-18-years-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The Cockcroft-Gault equation is not as accurate as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study or Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) equations for estimating GFR.

A validated calculator has been developed to estimate the risk of kidney failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Like most prior kidney failure risk models, both age and eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> were included in the prediction model.

Although they may be at higher risk for ESRD because of lower functional reserve (fewer functioning nephrons), this is still a relatively rare event, particularly in the elderly with an eGFR of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Context is particularly relevant, as there are no known therapies that can reverse the age-related decline in GFR. It may also be helpful to discuss that senescence occurs in many other organs such as the skin and the lungs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-lesions-of-the-skin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign lesions of the skin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting reference values for pulmonary function tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530978\"><span class=\"h1\">ALBUMINURIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although urine albumin excretion increases with age in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>], 24-hour urine albumin excretion does <strong>not</strong> increase with age in healthy adults, provided few or no comorbidities are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, albuminuria may be a useful marker for distinguishing normal aging from another etiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD). </p><p>However, the random first morning urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), which is more widely used in clinical practice than a 24-hour urine collection, is more likely to give a falsely elevated result in an aged population. Unlike the 24-hour urine albumin excretion, UACR usually increases with healthy aging due in part to age-related reductions in muscle mass that result in reduced creatinine generation and excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/71,110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,110,111</a>]. If a random or morning UACR is used to assess albuminuria in older adults, multiplying the UACR by the <strong>expected</strong> 24-hour urine creatinine may improve the accuracy of the test for detecting an abnormally high albumin excretion. The expected 24-hour urine creatinine can be calculated from one of several formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-aging-kidney/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9530990\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1999, glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-estimating equations started to replace serum creatinine for the evaluation of kidney function. Since that time, more and more older adults have been identified as having acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the prevalence of diagnosed kidney disease in this population has increased. About half of adults over the age of 70 years now have a measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, a threshold often used to diagnose CKD. This higher prevalence of diagnosed CKD is not simply due to increased recognition of diseases that tend to cluster in older adults. Rather, much of the increased rate of CKD diagnoses in the elderly population results from the normal structural and functional changes that occur in the kidney with aging. (See <a href=\"#H9530757\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish the structural and functional changes of a kidney affected by a specific preventable or treatable disease from those of a kidney undergoing the inevitable consequences of aging. However, even if the reduction in function is not preventable or treatable, senescent changes in the kidney are relevant and important to managing older patients. Specifically, loss of renal reserves with aging has the following clinical significance (see <a href=\"#H9530763\" class=\"local\">'Normal aging versus chronic disease'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More advanced disease if a new specific nephropathy, such as diabetic nephropathy or vasculitis, develops</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased susceptibility to acute kidney injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Toxic accumulation of renally cleared medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The need for age-appropriate criteria in the selection of living kidney donors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various structural changes occur with aging, including (see <a href=\"#H5974756\" class=\"local\">'Structural changes of the kidneys with aging'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nephrosclerosis (see <a href=\"#H9530776\" class=\"local\">'Nephrosclerosis'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decline in nephron number (see <a href=\"#H555989155\" class=\"local\">'Nephron number in aging kidneys'</a> above) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased kidney cortical volume (see <a href=\"#H9530802\" class=\"local\">'Kidney volume'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Development of renal cysts (see <a href=\"#H9530814\" class=\"local\">'Renal cysts and tumors'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of GFR decline with aging follow a fairly normal (Gaussian) distribution, suggesting that it is primarily driven by a physiological process. Not only does the lower reference limit for GFR decrease with age, but the upper reference limit also decreases with age, consistent with a universal or near-universal decline in kidney function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91445 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9530838\" class=\"local\">'GFR declines with normal aging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines define and stage CKD by levels of GFR and albuminuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597 \">table 3</a>). Approximately half of adults older than 70 years are found to have &quot;CKD&quot; as determined by a measured or estimated GFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Often, a specific disease process for a GFR reduction to &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> in older adults cannot be identified (other than normal aging). (See <a href=\"#H9530864\" class=\"local\">'High proportion of older adults with reduced GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of CKD in older adults may exist, particularly when the patient's eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub> is barely below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, when other evidence of CKD such as albuminuria is lacking, or when the muscle mass is higher than average for the patient's age. When such uncertainty exists regarding the diagnosis of CKD based upon eGFR<sub>creatinine</sub>, a urinary creatinine clearance or direct GFR measurement can further assess the kidney function of older adult patients. This may be particularly important when an accurate GFR assessment is needed for an older patient who wants to donate a kidney. In contrast to KDIGO suggestions, we do not recommend use of cystatin C to confirm a diagnosis of CKD in older adults. (See <a href=\"#H4642987\" class=\"local\">'When and how to confirm CKD in older adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several important issues in the management of patients with age-related changes in kidney structure and function. These include (see <a href=\"#H9530922\" class=\"local\">'Clinical significance of the aging kidney'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are no proven therapies to halt or reverse age-related declines in GFR. Any therapy aimed at raising the GFR by causing the remaining functional nephrons to filter more may actually be harmful rather than beneficial to the kidney. Hypertrophy and hyperfiltration of functional glomeruli in animals, for example, can lead to further glomerulosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with age-related reductions in GFR require medication dose adjustments. (See <a href=\"#H9530935\" class=\"local\">'Medication dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The loss of functioning nephrons associated with normal aging puts older adults at higher risk for acute kidney injury. (See <a href=\"#H9530941\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A mild reduction in eGFR with aging does <strong>not</strong> substantially improve the assessment of cardiovascular risk over conventional predictors and does <strong>not</strong> indicate a high risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91447 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9530947\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9530953\" class=\"local\">'End-stage renal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age-related declines in GFR do <strong>not</strong> typically prevent older adults from becoming living kidney donors. (See <a href=\"#H9530959\" class=\"local\">'Living kidney donor evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overall, the typical age-related declines in GFR have little, if any, effect on life expectancy or the future need for dialysis, and this point is important in discussions with older adult patients.
