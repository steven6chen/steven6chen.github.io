TMS may be efficacious for bipolar major depression. The adverse effects of TMS in patients with bipolar disorder are thought to be generally similar to the adverse effects seen in patients with unipolar major depression; the most serious adverse effect is a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. TMS does not appear to cause switching from bipolar major depression to mania or hypomania.
