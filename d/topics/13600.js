According to the 2015 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) National Poison Data System, 1606 single-substance phenytoin exposures resulted in only 33 major outcomes and two deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There were four reported fatalities in cases of multiple-substance exposures in which phenytoin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a> was deemed contributory, but in none of these cases was phenytoin determined to be the primary cause of death. This low incidence of major outcomes and deaths is similar to that seen in previous years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fosphenytoin</a>, a prodrug of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, is believed to have fewer adverse effects than phenytoin. However, there were 29 cases of cardiac events related to fosphenytoin infusion reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1997 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ten of these resulted in death. Arrhythmias included bradycardia, high degree AV block, and sinus arrest. It is unclear how many of these dysrhythmias can be directly attributed to fosphenytoin, since many of these patients had significant preexisting cardiac pathology or were presumed to be in a state of cardiac stress from status epilepticus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenytoin</a> binds and inhibits voltage-dependent sodium channels, which are found on both neuronal and cardiac tissue. The increased membrane threshold for depolarization after sodium channel blockade lowers the susceptibility of neuronal tissue to epileptogenic stimuli. Excessive inhibition, however, may compromise normal cerebral function, leading to the incoordination and altered mental status characteristic of both acute and chronic phenytoin toxicity.</p><p>Inhibition of sodium channels in cardiac tissue reduces the risk of arrhythmia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenytoin</a> shortens cardiac action potentials and prolongs the refractory period between them. Cardiac effects such as dysrhythmias and SA and AV nodal blockade have been reported, especially following intravenous administration of phenytoin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Oral phenytoin has only rarely been reported to cause cardiac complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenytoin</a> is diluted in parenteral formulations using propylene glycol, which may cause toxicity, including hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenytoin</a> is 70 percent bioavailable after oral ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The volume of distribution is approximately 0.5 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg,</span> with significant protein binding (to albumin) in vivo. Phenytoin may be displaced from plasma proteins by many drugs, which can result in toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. At higher serum concentrations of phenytoin, protein binding saturates and free phenytoin concentrations (which determine toxicity) increase dramatically with only modest increases in overall phenytoin concentrations. This is important to bear in mind when interpreting toxic serum phenytoin concentrations. A list of drugs that alter serum phenytoin concentrations is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82330\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82330 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenytoin</a> metabolism varies depending upon its serum concentration. Hydroxylation by the cytochrome p450 system is the critical step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Metabolism follows first-order kinetics in the therapeutic range and mild overdoses, meaning that a fixed percentage of phenytoin is eliminated over a given period. At higher concentrations, the cytochrome p450 enzyme system becomes saturated, leading to zero-order kinetics in which a fixed amount of phenytoin is eliminated over a given period. This results in a prolonged half-life (24 to 230 hours in overdose) and contributes to increased serum concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> is affected by many substances that interact with the cytochrome p450 system. A large number of drug-drug interactions will either raise or lower serum phenytoin concentrations, depending upon whether they induce or inhibit the p450 system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82330\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82330 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Cytochrome p450 genetic polymorphism appears to predispose some individuals to phenytoin toxicity secondary to slow metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fosphenytoin</a> is a prodrug that is converted to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> by serum and tissue alkaline phosphatases. Fosphenytoin is more expensive than phenytoin and is only available for intravenous and intramuscular administration. The fosphenytoin preparation does not contain propylene glycol and was initially thought to provide a safer means for rapid intravenous infusion, although cardiac toxicity and deaths from fosphenytoin have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. Literature review demonstrates a very similar adverse effect profile to phenytoin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fosphenytoin</a> binds to serum proteins and, in the presence of renal or hepatic disease, its plasma concentration will be elevated and its rate of conversion to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> may accelerate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) Additionally, fosphenytoin will competitively displace phenytoin from plasma protein binding sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History and drug administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> toxicity (from overdoses or chronic toxicity) is frequently encountered in patients with epilepsy, particularly after a change in medication dosing. Such patients generally complain of worsening coordination. More serious intoxication is usually seen with intentional ingestions or therapeutic error. Intravenous loading of phenytoin in a patient presumed to be noncompliant is a common scenario. To avoid the latter error, we recommend obtaining a serum phenytoin concentration prior to IV loading to treat assumed noncompliance. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>Rapid administration of parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> and, to a possibly lesser extent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a>, is associated with hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and occasional asystole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]. These manifestations are avoided by slow (less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min)</span> intravenous administration.</p><p>In cases of overdose with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, the clinician should inquire about depression, intentional self-injury, coingestants, and use of illicit drugs. Additional history regarding trauma, past medical history, and current medications may help to identify comorbidities and coingestants. General issues related to the history and physical examination of the poisoned patient are discussed elsewhere.

AHS represents an idiosyncratic drug reaction that occurs in 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 patients treated with phenytoin and has a fatality rate of 10 percent. Symptoms vary but classically include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and possibly other organ involvement. Pharyngitis is common. When severe, the syndrome can include hepatitis, megaloblastic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, and arteritis. AHS is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eruptions#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug eruptions&quot;, section on 'Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)'</a>.)</p><p>Signs of AHS are usually seen within two months of starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> therapy.

Development of these conditions following phenytoin exposure is idiosyncratic. Most cases occur within the first two months of phenytoin use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

PGS generally develops within the first 24 hours after infusion and resolves within days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. It is not known what proportion of PGS cases resolve without intervention or without significant complications, as serious cases of PGS are rare and milder cases may be unreported. Typically, PGS presents with peripheral edema, blistering, pain, and discoloration of the extremity receiving intravenous phenytoin. Pulses and sensation may be diminished. Superficial venous thrombosis has been noted in histopathological samples, although arterial Doppler studies are usually normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. Skin necrosis may develop, and treatment may require surgical intervention. </p><p>The pathophysiology of PGS is poorly understood, although many theoretical mechanisms have been proposed, including chemical irritation from added propylene glycol and sodium hydroxide, vasoconstriction, vasculitis, microthrombus formation, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> leakage into soft tissue with subsequent edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Extravasation is not uniformly present, and extravasation of phenytoin does not necessarily result in PGS. PGS has been reported after an overdose of oral phenytoin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Use of large bore cannulas or central lines for phenytoin administration has been reported to decrease the incidence of PGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxic levels of other anticonvulsant agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, may present with ataxia and altered mental status. Patients who are postictal may present with an abnormal neurological examination and depressed mental status, although isolated nystagmus and ataxia are unusual. Hypoglycemia should always be considered and ruled out in the setting of altered mental status or new-onset neurological abnormality. Ataxia may be encountered with a broad range of neurological disease and drug toxicities including: cerebellar disease (eg, stroke, hemorrhage, mass), Wernicke's Encephalopathy, ethanol or toxic alcohol overdose, and Parkinson disease.

Discordant exam findings and serum concentrations should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. As an example, the presence of coma is generally not consistent with a serum phenytoin concentration below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/mL</span> or 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span>. In the setting of an acute overdose, however, serum concentrations may be rising rapidly enough to account for progression to coma. Serial measurements of the serum phenytoin concentration should be obtained when patients with an acute overdose deteriorate rapidly.</p><p>A serum albumin concentration may help explain any discordance between serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> concentration and clinical symptoms. Hypoalbuminemia results in a higher free phenytoin concentration at any given total phenytoin level. Because it is the free phenytoin concentration that determines toxicity but the total phenytoin concentration that is reported, hypoalbuminemic patients with a therapeutic or mildly elevated phenytoin concentration may exhibit significant toxicity. The free phenytoin concentration is generally not measured, unless the diagnosis remains in doubt following a careful clinical and laboratory evaluation.</p><p>Further laboratory testing may include liver function tests and serum electrolytes. Hepatic dysfunction will increase the risk of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> toxicity and prolong the effects of intoxication by reducing the rate of metabolism.</p><p>A complete blood count (CBC) rarely affects management. Remember that leukocytosis is commonly encountered after seizures, and a normal white blood cell count does not exclude meningitis or encephalitis. Computed tomography of the brain may be needed to screen for suspected intracranial pathology in patients with stupor or coma.</p><p>In patients with anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, liver function tests will often show elevated aminotransferases and the CBC with differential will frequently show eosinophilia or marked leukocytosis.

We do not always use multiple doses of activated charcoal, but it appears to be effective. Charcoal should be withheld in patients who cannot protect their airway, unless endotracheal intubation is performed first. However, endotracheal intubation should not be performed solely for the purpose of giving charcoal.

Following systematic review and analysis of clinical data obtained from 31 patients (30 case reports or case series), the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) Workgroup proposes the use of either intermittent hemodialysis (preferred) or hemoperfusion (acceptable) in select cases of severe poisoning with prolonged coma or prolonged incapacitating ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. We believe this is a reasonable approach, but recommend consultation with a medical toxicologist if possible when hemodialysis is considered.

Standard care for cases not involving digital or skin necrosis includes close observation, elevation of the affected limb above the level of the heart, and analgesia. There is not yet sufficient data to formulate strong recommendations about how long an observation period is necessary.

Serial phenytoin concentrations should be obtained roughly every two hours until the serum concentration has stabilized, as it can increase over the first several hours, especially if gastrointestinal decontamination is inadequate. Falling serum concentrations correlate with clinical improvement, generally noted by the resolution of ataxia, slurred speech, and nystagmus. Once medical symptoms resolve, psychiatric consultation is needed for all cases of intentional ingestion.</p><p>The disposition of the patient with chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> toxicity depends on both the degree of toxicity and social circumstances. As a general rule, patients may be discharged home if they can ambulate safely and have someone (eg, family member, partner) who will stay with them and assist with the activities of daily living until toxicity has completely resolved. Patients who cannot ambulate safely or do not have someone to provide assistance should be admitted to the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should maintain a lower threshold to admit children with suspected <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> toxicity. Children may manifest clinical signs of phenytoin toxicity at serum concentrations lower than adults. Furthermore, the presentation of significant toxicity may be more subtle and examination findings limited.</p><p>As with adults, the basis for decision-making is clinical evaluation rather than laboratory testing. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenytoin</a> toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any pediatric patient with nystagmus and ataxia or altered mental status, and a family member known to take anticonvulsants. Infants and toddlers cannot demonstrate ataxia and intoxication may be difficult to detect.

Older children with less significant symptoms (eg, nystagmus and mild ataxia), responsible caretakers, and prearranged neurology follow-up may be discharged home with clear instructions to return immediately for any worsening of symptoms.</p><p>Because many cases of lethal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> toxicity in children are due to therapeutic error, children receiving parenteral administrations must be carefully monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phenytoin-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4023719\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222).

Signs of mild to moderate toxicity (serum concentrations below 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> [40 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/mL</span> or 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L])</span> are typically confined to nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, nausea, and vomiting. At higher levels of toxicity, mental status can deteriorate to coma, and cardiac dysrhythmias and seizures may occur. A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56499 \">table 1</a>).

To avoid these errors, a serum phenytoin concentration should be obtained prior to IV loading, and the rate of IV phenytoin administration should be kept below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span>. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History and drug administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic levels of other anticonvulsant agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, may also present with ataxia and altered mental status. The differential diagnosis for symptoms consistent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> intoxication is broad, and includes hypoglycemia, postictal state, cerebellar disease (eg, stroke, hemorrhage, mass), Wernicke's encephalopathy, and ethanol or toxic alcohol overdose.

Serial levels can be helpful, particularly if the patient acutely decompensates. Serum concentrations generally correlate with clinical findings. Discordant serum concentrations and clinical signs should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. Standard toxicologic screening tests should be performed for any patient with an intentional or unclear overdose. Other studies are obtained based upon clinical circumstance.

The airway, breathing, and circulation of the rare unstable patient are stabilized as necessary. In patients with phenytoin overdose but without a depressed mental status, we suggest administering a single dose of activated charcoal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Multiple doses of activated charcoal may be helpful, even among patients with chronic or intravenous toxicity.
