In general, without treatment the survival of patients with PTCL is measured in months. With combination chemotherapy, five-year overall survival rates may be as high as 74 and 49 percent among patients with a low (ie, zero to 1) or low-intermediate (ie, 2) score on the International Prognostic Index (IPI), respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, such low risk patients are uncommon and the five-year survival rates after combination chemotherapy are 21 and 6 percent for the more common patient with high-intermediate (ie, 3) or high (ie, 4 to 5) IPI scores, respectively.</p><p>Historically, patients with PTCL have been included in trials of chemotherapy regimens for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, the rarity and heterogeneity of patients with PTCL have limited the ability to make conclusions regarding treatment based on subset analyses of these trials. It is clear that patients with T cell NHL have inferior rates of response to chemotherapy, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival than patients with B cell NHL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall response rates with CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) chemotherapy for T cell NHL range from 50 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In comparison, response rates with CHOP or CHOP plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in B cell NHL are generally 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median PFS in PTCL following CHOP chemotherapy is 12 to 14 months with approximately 30 percent of patients being alive and free of disease five years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By way of comparison, the PFS at five years in diffuse large B cell lymphoma is 54 percent with approximately 60 percent of patients being long-term disease-free survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>The poor outcomes with conventional chemotherapy have generated interest in more aggressive strategies such as the use of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation or radiation therapy as consolidation. The role of consolidation therapy in PTCL is controversial and its use varies depending upon the lymphoma subtype and the patient's IPI score. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Consolidation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with that proposed by consensus guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the European Society for Medical Oncology, the British Committee for Standards in Haematology, and the Italian Society of Hematology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no general consensus regarding the preferred induction chemotherapy for peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), and patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever possible. Most of the treatment regimens that have been studied combine an anthracycline with an alkylating agent. Examples of regimens most commonly considered for the treatment of patients with PTCL not enrolled in clinical trials include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81762 \">table 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPOCH (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>)</p><p/><p>There have been few prospective trials comparing chemotherapy regimens in this population. CHOP has become the most frequently employed regimen for PTCL largely based on the extrapolation of studies in aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients with PTCL comprised a minority of the patients in randomized trials comparing CHOP chemotherapy with many other anthracycline-based regimens in aggressive NHL. When compared with CHOP, more aggressive regimens offered no improvement in remission rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival and were associated with increased toxicity. These studies are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H353924109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Choice of chemotherapy regimen'</a>.)</p><p>A randomized phase III trial comparing CHOP chemotherapy with a more intensive chemotherapy regimen (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> alternating with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) in 88 patients with newly diagnosed PTCL reported no difference in event-free survival at two years, but greater toxicity with the more intensive regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, a single institution retrospective analysis of 135 patients with PTCL reported no improvement in three-year overall survival rates when CHOP was compared with more intensive regimens such as HyperCVAD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, doxorubicin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients treated with intensive regimens had more early deaths due to treatment toxicity.</p><p>While highly intensive chemotherapy regimens do not appear to improve outcomes, data suggest that adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> to standard dose CHOP for younger patients with PTCL improves event-free survival but does not improve overall survival. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A post-hoc analysis evaluated outcomes from 320 patients with PTCL treated on prospective trials with six to eight cycles of CHOP or CHOP plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> (CHOEP) and followed for a median of 44 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The majority of patients had one of the following four entities: ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, 24 percent); ALK-negative ALCL (35 percent); PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS, 22 percent); or angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL, 9 percent). For patients younger than age 60 who had a normal LDH at diagnosis, CHOEP resulted in a significantly higher rate of event-free survival at three years when compared with CHOP (75 versus 51 percent, respectively). The magnitude of difference in event-free survival was largest for patients with ALK-positive ALCL (91 versus 57 percent) and was smaller when these patients were excluded from the analysis (61 versus 48 percent). This benefit was not seen in patients over the age of 60 years. There was no significant difference in overall survival at three years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional support comes from an analysis of the Swedish Lymphoma Registry, which identified 252 patients with enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma or nodal PTCL other than ALK-positive ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For patients 60 years or younger, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> to CHOP was associated with superior response rates and progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.49), but not overall survival.</p><p/><p>For patients with newly diagnosed PTCL who are not candidates for clinical trials or do not wish to participate in clinical trials, we suggest induction chemotherapy with a CHOP-based regimen rather than more intensive induction regimens such as EPOCH or HyperCVAD. For patients younger than 60 years, we suggest the use of CHOEP rather than CHOP. This preference places a high importance on the improved event-free survival seen with CHOEP with the understanding that adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> will increase toxicity. Patients over the age of 60 years are generally treated with CHOP in order to avoid the increased toxicity. With either of these regimens, we administer CHOP every three weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81762 \">table 4</a>). For CHOEP, intravenous etoposide (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> is administered on days 1 through 3 of each 21-day cycle in addition to standard CHOP. Alternatively, standard CHOP may be administered with intravenous etoposide (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> on day 1 followed by oral etoposide (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> on days 2 and 3 of each 21-day cycle. The higher oral dose of etoposide is necessary due to poor bioavailability with oral administration.</p><p>Depending on the histology and patient population studied, overall response rates with CHOP are between 50 and 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most common severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> side effect is granulocytopenia (approximately 60 percent). Other common side effects are generally mild to moderate alopecia, nausea, vomiting, and infusion-related reactions. There is a 1 percent treatment-related mortality rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSOLIDATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The poor outcomes in certain subgroups of patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) after conventional chemotherapy alone have generated interest in the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or radiation therapy (RT) as consolidation therapy. The role of consolidation therapy in PTCL is controversial. However, there is a general consensus that HCT is <strong>not</strong> indicated after the attainment of a first complete remission (CR) in the following two subgroups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Such patients have five-year overall survival (OS) rates ranging from 70 to 93 percent after anthracycline-based chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma#H953620459\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Autologous HCT in first remission'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with localized PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) and a low or low-intermediate International Prognostic Index (IPI) score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 3</a>). Five-year OS rates are 74 and 49 percent among patients with a low (ie, zero to 1) or low-intermediate (ie, 2) IPI score, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>PTCL patients who do not fit into these two categories have five-year OS rates of 20 percent or less after combination chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Such patients should be considered for consolidation therapy. The choice among autologous HCT, RT, or a combination of the two depends on the patient's candidacy for HCT and the extent of initial disease. Consolidation RT is largely reserved for use in patients with localized (stage I or II) PTCL. Autologous HCT, preferably given in the context of a clinical trial, is generally offered in addition to radiation for patients initially presenting with localized disease and an intermediate or high IPI score. Autologous HCT, administered without RT, is offered to those who had extensive disease at the time of diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Autologous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autologous HCT has been evaluated for the treatment of PTCL in retrospective analyses, database studies, and small prospective trials enrolling a very select group of patients with good performance status. Overall, autologous HCT appears to be most beneficial for patients in first CR relative to second or subsequent CR or partial remission (PR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. With autologous HCT in first CR, OS rates may be as high as 85 percent at three years and 30 percent at five years post-autologous HCT, but vary depending on the lymphoma subtype and IPI score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>As mentioned above, our general approach to the use of autologous HCT for consolidation after CR is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely perform autologous HCT for patients with PTCL, NOS in first CR who have localized disease and a low or low-intermediate IPI score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 3</a>). This is principally because such patients demonstrate five-year OS rates ranging from 50 to 75 percent after chemotherapy plus consolidation RT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are candidates for autologous HCT with PTCL, NOS and a high-intermediate or high IPI score, we generally offer consolidation with autologous HCT in first CR since such patients demonstrate five-year OS rates of 20 percent or less after combination chemotherapy alone.</p><p/><p>Treatment-related morbidity and mortality with autologous HCT are relatively low (&le;3 percent); however, patients who undergo autologous HCT are at risk for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, the time course of which varies in the post-transplant period, according to the degree of immune deficiency and cytopenia induced by the transplantation procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following are summaries of the largest studies investigating autologous HCT in PTCL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a phase II trial, 160 patients with previously untreated PTCL (not ALK-positive ALCL) were treated with six cycles of biweekly CHOEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etoposide</a> was omitted in patients &gt;60 years of age. In total, 115 (72 percent) attained a CR or PR and proceeded with high dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT. Treatment-related mortality was 4 percent. At a median follow-up of 60.5 months, estimated OS rates and progression-free survival (PFS) at five years were 51 percent (95% CI 43-59 percent) and 44 percent (95% CI 36-52 percent), respectively.

In general, these trials included heterogeneous patient populations and utilized a variety of induction and conditioning regimens. Several included patients with ALK-positive ALCL, a group now known to have a superior prognosis even with treatment strategies that do not incorporate HCT. In these studies, OS rates ranged from 86 percent at three years to approximately 30 percent at 5 to 12 years post-autologous HCT. Universally, these trials have tended to include a select group of younger patients. This fact, combined with the heterogeneous nature of the treatments and non-randomized design of the trials, makes it impossible to render a definitive assessment of the utility of autologous HCT in first CR for PTCL. A large, international randomized trial is desperately needed to answer this important question.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Allogeneic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic HCT has also been studied in PTCL, primarily in the <span class=\"nowrap\">relapsed/refractory</span> setting.

RT is generally offered to such patients who are not HCT candidates. However, if a patient is a candidate for HCT, the choice to use RT in this setting is complicated by the degree of response to chemotherapy. As an example, a patient with minimal residual disease may benefit from going straight to HCT. In comparison, a patient with more substantial residual disease may be offered a second-line chemotherapy regimen prior to HCT or may be offered RT administered before or after HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of symptoms from localized disease in the palliative setting.</p><p/><p>Data on the use of consolidation radiation therapy in this setting are limited to retrospective analyses and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Such analyses have noted a high rate of local relapse (30 to 40 percent at five years) with chemotherapy administered alone or with standard radiation doses used for B cell lymphomas. There has been a suggestion that higher radiation doses (eg, &ge;40 Gy) may provide better local control for patients with PTCL after CR is obtained with chemotherapy.</p><p>Our practice is consistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, which recommend consolidative RT in all PTCL patients with stage I or II disease who achieve remission after standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Unlike in diffuse large B cell lymphoma where chemotherapy is abbreviated if RT is used for consolidation, patients with limited stage PTCL are treated with a full course of six to eight cycles of CHOP prior to the incorporation of radiation. This is principally because it is not known if the addition of RT allows for the truncation of CHOP chemotherapy with similar long-term outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MODIFICATION FOR SUBTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the most common peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) histology is PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), there are several subtypes of PTCL with unique features that require treatment modifications.

In general, patients are treated with the same induction therapy regimens used for PTCL, NOS. Post-remission therapy is dependent on the patient's age and comorbidities along with the ALK status of the tumor. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus regarding the preferred initial treatment of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). Treatment options include steroids, combination chemotherapy, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and investigational therapies. Although complete remission (CR) can be attained in many patients, relapse is frequent, with median overall survival (OS) rates ranging from 15 to 36 months with chemotherapy and approximately four years with autologous HCT. Infection is the most common cause of death.</p><p>Small, uncontrolled prospective trials and retrospective analyses have investigated the use of steroids, combination chemotherapy, autologous HCT, and allogeneic HCT for the treatment of AITL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective, uncontrolled trial of 39 patients with AITL investigated a staged treatment approach in which patients were initially treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Those who did not attain a CR with prednisone or those with life-threatening disease at the time of diagnosis were treated with an anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy regimen.

When compared with those who had chemotherapy-sensitive disease without a CR, patients who had achieved a CR prior to autologous HCT had superior rates of progression-free survival (PFS) at two years (70 versus 42 percent) and four years (56 versus 30 percent). Patients who had refractory disease at the time of autologous HCT had the worst outcome with a PFS of 23 percent at 24 and 48 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of 45 patients with AITL who underwent myeloablative (25 patients) or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT reported one- and three-year OS rates of 66 and 64 percent, respectively, with 53 percent of patients being alive without disease progression at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. OS and PFS were significantly better for those patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease at the time of HCT.</p><p/><p>For medically fit patients with AITL, we suggest treatment with induction chemotherapy such as that used for PTCL, NOS (eg, CHOEP for patients under age 60, CHOP for patients over age 60) followed by autologous HCT for those patients who attain a CR. Those who can tolerate chemotherapy but are not candidates for autologous HCT can be treated with chemotherapy followed by observation. Patients who have comorbidities that prevent the use of combination chemotherapy may be considered for initial treatment with steroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>). The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to chemotherapy cannot be recommended in this setting in the absence of trials demonstrating a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the treatment of hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma.

No standard therapy exists, though autologous or even allogeneic transplantation should be considered in patients who achieve a CR.

We offer the following suggestions for patients who are not candidates for or choose not to participate in clinical trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The treatment of the following subtypes of PTCL is discussed separately:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anaplastic large cell lymphoma &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adult T cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mycosis <span class=\"nowrap\">fungoides/S&eacute;zary</span> syndrome &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of advanced stage (IIB to IV) mycosis fungoides&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extranodal <span class=\"nowrap\">NK/T</span> cell lymphoma, nasal type &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-extranodal-nk-t-cell-lymphoma-nasal-type\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with newly diagnosed PTCL, we suggest induction combination chemotherapy with a CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>)-based regimen rather than more intensive induction regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients younger than 60 years of age, we suggest the use of CHOP plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> (CHOEP) rather than CHOP alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients over the age of 60 years, we suggest the use of CHOP without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the completion of induction chemotherapy, patients should be evaluated for the use of consolidation therapy with radiation therapy (RT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Those with limited stage disease who achieve a partial response (PR) may attain a complete remission (CR) if consolidation radiation is administered. The use of autologous HCT in first CR is principally based on the PTCL subtype and the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 3</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) in first CR and a low or low-intermediate IPI score, we suggest observation rather than autologous HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Consolidation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), we suggest autologous HCT in first CR rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Those who can tolerate chemotherapy but are not candidates for autologous HCT can be treated with chemotherapy followed by observation. Patients who have comorbidities that prevent the use of combination chemotherapy may be considered for initial treatment with steroids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>).
