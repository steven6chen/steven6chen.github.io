Secondary causes of complement deficiency will be presented in this topic review. Inherited disorders of the complement system, as well as a description of the complement pathways and the clinical evaluation of complement, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H308902\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired deficiencies in complement proteins are more common than inherited complement disorders. Reductions in complement secondary to acquired disease processes are usually only partial and affect several complement components at once. As an example, approximately 50 percent of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) will have reductions in C4 and C3, reflecting classical pathway activation.</p><p>These acquired complement deficiencies are most commonly encountered in diseases featuring autoantibodies. In many diseases, such as milder forms of SLE, augmented hepatic synthesis of components may be sufficient to maintain the levels in the normal range. The management of most disorders of the complement system featuring excessive activation focuses on the treatment of the underlying disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4147068480\"><span class=\"h2\">Challenges in interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One problem clinicians may encounter when managing disorders featuring acquired deficiencies of complement components is that the predisease levels of proteins, such as C3, are rarely known. For example, the &quot;normal&quot; laboratory range of C3 in the population is from 80 to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. A 17-year-old female with new-onset SLE may present with a C3 value of 92 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Although this is considered in the &quot;normal range,&quot; if her post-treatment C3 value rises to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in six weeks, then her predisease value was at least this or higher. Even at 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> a C3 turnover study or assessment of complement split products might show mildly accelerated consumption. Measuring C4, which commonly parallels changes in C3 levels, is more complicated because of C4 copy number, which is discussed elsewhere. Thus, complement levels need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;, section on 'C4 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7564840\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACQUIRED COMPLEMENT DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired deficiencies in complement proteins may result from several mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated consumption by immune complexes (common)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced hepatic synthesis (uncommon)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of complement components in the urine (rare)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED CONSUMPTION BY IMMUNE COMPLEXES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the diseases in which complement activation is sufficient to reduce plasma levels are characterized by the presence of immune complexes. The disease that best illustrates this point is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p><p>In a large Japanese series of patients with low C4, C3, and total hemolytic complement (THC or CH50), SLE accounted for approximately two-thirds of the cases, while other vasculitic syndromes accounted for approximately 20 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56322\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56322 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By requiring both a low C4 and C3, the authors selected for patients with classical pathway activation. By comparison, concentrations of the lectin pathway initiating factors (eg, mannose-binding lectin) are relatively fixed, compared with antibodies that activate the classical pathway, and are insufficient to substantially decrease C4 and C3 in blood. The pattern of normal C4 and a low C3, which is uncommonly encountered, indicates alternative pathway activation. Diseases to consider with this profile would be glomerulonephritis, partial lipodystrophy, acute rheumatic fever, and some forms of vasculitis. In these disorders, the alternative pathway is preferentially activated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low C4 and C3 (C2 would also be reduced but is usually not measured) occur in about 50 percent of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), reflecting in most cases, activation of the classical complement pathway by immune complexes. Accelerated consumption outstrips synthesis and is the cause of hypocomplementemia in about 90 percent of such cases, while the remaining 10 percent also show signs of reduced hepatic synthesis.</p><p>The usual pattern of complement activation in SLE involves the classical pathway, leading to low C3 and C4, while factor B of the alternative pathway is normal. However, a small percentage of patients (approximately 3 to 5 percent) demonstrate predominant alternative pathway activation, as evidenced by normal C4 but low C3 and factor B. In this situation, the autoantibodies are often subclasses that do not fix complement directly but coat the surface of the antigen, providing a surface for alternative pathway proteins to be protected from regulators.</p><p>Immune complex deposition has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tissue damage in most organs afflicted in SLE, particularly the skin, kidneys, joints, and serosal surfaces. Low complement values tend to correlate with more severe SLE, especially with renal disease, and with antibodies to double-stranded DNA. A return to normal levels with treatment is a good prognostic sign. If a patient with SLE presents with low C4 and C3 levels that improve with treatment in parallel with other parameters, then C4 and C3 may become a valuable biomarker of disease activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with SLE may be susceptible to infection with encapsulated bacteria because of immunosuppressive medications, functional asplenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypocomplementemia, although the relative contribution of hypocomplementemia is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Vaccination and prophylaxis of SLE patients against infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A developing area of research involves the measurement of complement fragment deposition (such as C3d and C4d) on peripheral blood cells (ie, red blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes) as a biomarker of lupus disease activity, analogous to the use of HbA1c in diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Similarly, blood levels of the activation fragments or split products, such as C3a, C5a, Bb, soluble C5b-C9, and others, are being investigated. While becoming more available commercially, neither cell-based nor plasma &quot;split products&quot; of complement activation are routinely utilized by most experienced lupus clinicians. Possible reasons for this include cost, relative unavailability of the tests, and difficulty or lack of experience in interpreting these results. In addition, no convincing data demonstrate that these tests offer a distinct advantage in the evaluation of C4 and C3 antigenic levels for most patients.</p><p>One marker of disease activity in immune complex-mediated syndromes is an acquired reduction in the levels of complement receptor 1 (CR1, also known as CD35 and the C3b receptor) on erythrocytes. As is the case for split products, there are multiple issues relative to assessing and interpreting CR1 levels on cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4305048\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiphospholipid syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiphospholipid syndrome can be associated with hypocomplementemia, analogous to what is seen in SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The discussion above for SLE applies to this disease as well. The antiphospholipid syndrome is discussed in more detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryoglobulinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoglobulins are serum proteins that precipitate at subphysiologic temperatures. Mixed cryoglobulins commonly consist of immune complexes that contain immunoglobulins, antigen, rheumatoid factor, and complement components (particularly fragments of C3 and C4). Cryoglobulinemia may be either essential (no underlying identifiable disease process) or secondary (in association with another disease). Chronic hepatitis B and C account for most all of the formerly idiopathic cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia. Monoclonal paraproteins that precipitate in the cold may also activate complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cryoglobulins-and-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cryoglobulins and cryoglobulinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The usual complement profile in the setting of essential or secondary cryoglobulinemia is that of classical pathway activation. The complement profile shows decreased levels of C4 and C2 with normal or slightly lowered C3. C3 levels are usually only modestly altered because it is harder to form C3 convertases on a soluble or precipitated immune complex than on a cell membrane.</p><p>In rheumatic disorders, the presence of cryoglobulins is usually associated with more severe disease. As an example, in SLE, there is a correlation of mixed cryoglobulins with renal involvement, vasculitic manifestations, and hypocomplementemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasculitic syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many vasculitic syndromes are caused by immune complexes. In these disorders, classical pathway activation by immune complexes initiates inflammatory processes and tissue destruction, primarily affecting blood vessels. Complement activation is usually not as marked as in SLE, although up to 50 percent of patients with polyarteritis may have decreased serum complement levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As in SLE, complement values can be helpful in assessing the clinical course, especially the response to therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466898\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many nephritides result from an inflammatory reaction within the kidney glomerulus that features leukocyte infiltration and cellular proliferation. Antibodies in the kidney may result from local immune complex formation or originate in the circulation as immune complexes that then lodge in the glomerulus. In either instance, the result can be activation of the complement system, with recruitment of inflammatory cells and subsequent tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The complement system is involved in multiple renal diseases, including acute poststreptococcal nephritis, immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (hemolytic uremic syndrome), types I and II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, SLE nephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and Goodpasture's disease. Immunohistochemical analyses for complement-activated fragments in renal biopsy specimens are often helpful in establishing that complement activation is occurring. In these renal diseases, neither serum hypocomplementemia nor the quantity of C3 fragments deposited is as dramatic as in SLE.

The autoantibody against the alternative pathway convertase is called C3 nephritic factor. The typical complement profile is a normal C4 with a low C3, factor B, and alternative pathway AH50, indicating alternative pathway activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-classification-and-causes-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, classification, and causes of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with C3 nephritic factor typically present in childhood with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis that may be accompanied by partial lipodystrophy as well as frequent infections with encapsulated bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Nephritic factor levels do not correlate predictably with disease activity, and progressive renal damage can occur in patients who are persistently normocomplementemic. The clinical features of glomerulonephritis associated with C3 nephritic factor are reviewed separately.

Dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement has been associated with pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most patients with DDD present with hypocomplementemia that persists throughout the course of disease. C3 and factor B levels are low, while C4 is normal. More than 80 percent of patients demonstrate a C3 nephritic factor. Genetic analyses have identified mutations in complement regulatory proteins (factors H and I) in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;C3 glomerulopathies: Dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3484331080\"><span class=\"h3\">C3 glomerulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the complement system in renal disease has become better elucidated. However, the nomenclature is in transition. The term &quot;C3 glomerulopathy&quot; (C3G) defines a glomerular pathologic entity that is composed almost solely of C3 and no or trace levels of immunoglobulin. It consists of DDD and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN). C3G usually manifests with a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

It leads to deficiency of C3 that is consumed by the stabilized classical pathway C3 convertase. Thus, the patient may present with recurrent bacterial infections secondary to the low C3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The C4 nephritic factor also has been found in a few patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and SLE, although its role in pathogenesis has not been defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1749094\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune hemolytic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cold agglutinin disease, immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies react with red blood cell antigens at reduced body temperatures, such as in the extremities. The antibodies activate the classical pathway, leading to the deposition of large quantities of C4, C3, and C5b-9. The red blood cell may be either phagocytosed or lysed. Cold agglutinins are associated with lymphoid malignancy (chronic cold agglutinin syndrome) or arise transiently following viral and mycoplasma infections. In approximately 20 percent of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated (warm antibody-mediated) hemolytic anemias, complement fixation also occurs and tends to correlate with more severe disease.

A variety of other idiopathic inflammatory conditions, including sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hypophysitis, retroperitoneal and mediastinal fibrosis, interstitial nephritis, and others, have also been associated with these autoantibodies. A hallmark pathologically is IgG<sub>4</sub>-positive plasma cell infiltration. The antibodies are not directly activating like those of IgG subclasses 1 and 3 but rather provide an altered surface on which the alternative pathway can be engaged.

Also, other viral infections, such as parvovirus and flavivirus infections featuring large antigenic loads, can develop a transient hypocomplementemia as the antibodies combine with viral antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-deficiencies-of-the-complement-system/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, these forms of hepatitis represent an example of a chronic serum sickness-like reaction (antigen binding by an immune host making antibody, leading to complement activation).

AAE has mostly been reported in patients with B cell lymphoproliferative disorders who present with new-onset swelling of the skin, abdominal viscera, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larynx. More than one mechanism has been implicated in the complement abnormalities seen in AAE. Most patients demonstrate an autoantibody to the C1 inhibitor that blocks its function or causes its premature removal. Others feature a monoclonal autoantibody on the B cell surface that activates C1 and consumes the C1 inhibitor.</p><p>AAE should be considered in patients with angioedema in which complement studies show low C4, low C1q, low or normal C1 inhibitor antigenic levels, and reduced C1 inhibitor function. C1q levels are normal in the hereditary form. Otherwise, complement profiles are similar in HAE and AAE.

As an example, low C3 and C4 levels may be seen in alcoholic liver disease. However, liver disease must be severe before there is a detectable decrease in plasma levels. For this reason, the coagulation system provides a more clinically useful measurement of hepatic synthetic function.

No clinical consequences have been reported in association with this laboratory observation.
