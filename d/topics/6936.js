Although many drugs are irritating when they are introduced into extravascular tissues, extravasation of a vesicant drug has the potential to cause tissue damage with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lasting injury. Although the most well-known vesicants are cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67517 \">table 1</a>), several non-antineoplastic drugs also have vesicant properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86804 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, prevention, and management of extravasation injury from chemotherapy and non-antineoplastic vesicants are reviewed here, with a focus on chemotherapy extravasation injury.

However, this series only includes patients who were referred to plastic surgery, rather than all extravasations, while the denominator includes all individual doses of chemotherapy delivered over the six-year study period.

Guidelines for prevention of chemotherapy extravasation are available from the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) and the European Oncology Nurses Society (EONS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>]. Several simple precautions can minimize the risk of extravasation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For peripheral infusions of chemotherapy, the intravenous (IV) line should be recently started, and the vein selected should be large and intact, with good blood return established prior to starting the infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infusion sites should be selected in the following order of preference: forearm (basilic, cephalic, and median antebrachial), dorsum of hand, wrist, antecubital fossae. With vesicants, try to avoid the antecubital fossa, wrist, and dorsum of the hand, if at all possible. Contractions from vesicant extravasation in these regions can cause serious long-term morbidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sites with sclerosis, thrombosis, or scar formation should be avoided, as should limbs with impaired circulation. Although controversial, most experts do not feel that the avoidance of IV lines on the ipsilateral side is necessary or beneficial in a woman who has undergone mastectomy for breast cancer as long as lymphedema is absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The butterfly needle or plastic cannula should be secured to the skin with tape. Taping of the entry site itself should be avoided so that the area can be examined. Instead, once the hub of the cannula or butterfly needle is secured to the skin with tape, a clear dressing, such as Tegaderm, should be applied to cover the skin entry site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patency of the IV line should be verified just prior to drug infusion by flushing with 5 to 10 mL of isotonic saline or a 5 percent dextrose solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instruct the patient to notify a clinician immediately if he or she experiences any pain, leaking, or other changes in sensation at the infusion site. Ensure that there are no barriers to effective communication. For patients with central venous catheters, this may include chest pain or dyspnea from pleural effusion if the tip should penetrate the superior vena cava.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chemotherapeutic agent, appropriately diluted, should be infused through the side arm of the freely-flowing IV with isotonic saline or 5 percent dextrose. During the infusion, patients should be closely monitored for pain (often described as mild to severe burning radiating along the vein), and the site should be inspected for erythema or swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of a central venous catheter for infusion of vesicant drugs provides reliable venous access, high flow rates, and rapid drug dilution. However, these vascular access devices are subject to a number of complications, including drug extravasation. The catheter tip may not be properly positioned in the superior vena cava or right atrium, it may migrate out of position, the needle may be improperly inserted into the injection port, or the catheter itself may be punctured or may rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The position of a catheter following surgical placement should be confirmed radiographically prior to drug administration. In addition, if there are any complaints of pain, even without soft tissue swelling or the lack of ability to draw blood or infuse a flush solution, there is a need to reconfirm the positioning of the catheter prior to continuing with the chemotherapy infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previously irradiated areas should be avoided whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that have established the role of specific interventions in the management of chemotherapy extravasation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

In one series of five such patients, the early administration of high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (8 mg twice daily for up to 14 days) appeared to have a beneficial effect on the severity and clinical course of the inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Corticosteroids may worsen the skin damage from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> or vinca alkaloids, and they are specifically contraindicated in these situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonhealing ulcers resulting from an extravasation injury often require debridement and skin grafting. However, the optimal timing of surgical intervention is controversial.</p><p>There are no uniform guidelines for the surgical treatment of extravasation injuries. Guidelines from the ONS do not address indications for surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Guidelines from the EONS recommend surgical debridement for unresolved tissue necrosis or pain lasting more than 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but whether surgical intervention is recommended in a patient complaining of persistent pain in the presence of normal-looking skin is unclear.</p><p>Although some clinicians suggest early surgical intervention to prevent ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/29,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,79</a>], a conservative approach is more often recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/45,80-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,80-84</a>], particularly since fewer than one-third of vesicant extravasations ultimately result in ulceration. Failure of initial conservative management with continued erythema, swelling and pain, or the presence of large areas of tissue necrosis or skin ulceration are indications for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/80,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75722763\"><span class=\"h3\">Issues unique to central venous access device extravasation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are only case report data regarding the evolution and management of extravasation through a central venous access device (CVAD). The diagnosis may be confirmed by imaging, typically with a thoracic computed tomography (CT).</p><p>Management should include stopping the infusion and aspirating through the CVAD catheter as much of the solution as possible. If the extravasated agent is an anthracycline, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexrazoxane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexrazoxane</a> could be considered as an antidote. The utility of local antidotes (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronidase</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-thiosulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium thiosulfate</a>) is unclear, and their use is not recommended in guidelines from the EONS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A CT scan should be obtained; catheter tip migration through the superior vena cava or atrium is a surgical emergency and requires immediate operation. If there is no evidence of suppurative mediastinitis, one would assume that the process is sterile, and therefore, conservative management is reasonable. Indications for operative intervention include failure of response to <span class=\"nowrap\">conservative/supportive</span> treatment, as indicated by the development of sepsis, progression of the radiographic abnormalities concurrent with clinical deterioration, and clinical deterioration in the setting of a collection or necrotic area, even if it appears &quot;improved&quot; on radiographic imaging. </p><p>The only data on surgical intervention for extravasation from CVAD come from published case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/18,38,86-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,38,86-90</a>]. Options include debridement of all necrotic material with the establishment of drainage and antibiotic therapy, and if extravasation is detected early, immediate removal of the port along with an intraoperative subcutaneous washout to help minimize the exposure of tissue to the extravasated agent and the risk of tissue necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In our view, decisions about whether to pursue an early subcutaneous washout procedure must be individualized, carefully weighing the need to retain the port for central venous access versus the risk of skin adverse events.</p><p>EONS guidelines recommend immediate surgical consultation with consideration of thoracentesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest tube placement if the extravasation is into the pleura, thoracoscopy or thoracotomy for an extravasation into the mediastinum, and surgical drainage of the accumulated solution in the case of a subcutaneous fluid collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extravasation-injury-from-chemotherapy-and-other-non-antineoplastic-vesicants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
