Atherosclerotic disease often involves the arteries providing flow to the lower extremities, referred to as lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). Atherosclerosis can lead to acute or chronic symptoms due to embolism from more proximal disease, or due to thrombosis of an artery that has been progressively narrowed. </p><p>Management of patients with lower extremity PAD should include medical therapies aimed at reducing the risk for future cardiovascular events related to atherosclerosis, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial events. These therapies are also particularly important for reducing the risk of events at the time of intervention (surgical or endovascular), when indicated, and for improving long-term survival.</p><p>An overview of atherosclerotic occlusive disease affecting the lower extremities is provided here. Disease affecting the upper extremity is reviewed separately.

Multiple factors contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia, inflammatory and immunologic factors, plaque rupture, and tobacco use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The symptoms related to atherosclerotic narrowing of the aorta or lower extremity arteries depend upon the location and severity of disease. Atherosclerotic disease tends to be well localized and usually occurs in the proximal or midportions of a given arterial bed. Atherosclerotic disease follows anatomic patterns, which also have a bearing on the natural history and progression of disease. Patients with diabetes or with end stage renal disease generally present with more distal disease.</p><p>Atherosclerosis in the aorta can be associated with aneurysm. The pathology of aneurysmal disease is felt to be distinct from that of atherosclerosis; however, the clinical manifestations may overlap. The clinical features of aneurysmal disease are reviewed separately.

Data from the 2010 United States census suggested that the overall burden of PAD among adults in the United States is greater for women compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Well-defined risk factors are associated with the development of PAD and include older age, hypertension, tobacco use, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

The natural history of those who present with mild-to-moderate claudication is generally benign, which contrasts with the more aggressive presentation seen in those who present with ischemic rest pain or ulceration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Single-level disease (ie, aortoiliac, superficial femoral) often manifests initially as claudication. Multilevel disease can manifest as claudication, when collateral circulation is adequate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 1</a>), but often manifests as ischemic rest pain or lower extremity ulceration when a well-developed collateral circulation is absent. Severe manifestations can occur without an intervening history of claudication, particularly in older patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic &ndash; Evidence of underlying atherosclerotic occlusive disease may be present in the absence of symptoms. It is estimated that there are three times as many asymptomatic patients with lower extremity PAD as symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although those with asymptomatic PAD may not report exertional leg discomfort by definition (ie, claudication), lower extremity physiological function may be impaired compared with matched controls without PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Due to the fact that PAD may predict risk for future cardiovascular events, screening for PAD in asymptomatic high-risk individuals using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is advocated by some, but not all expert groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

Claudication is a reproducible discomfort of a defined group of muscles that is induced by exercise and relieved with rest. Claudication can present unilaterally or bilaterally, as buttock and hip, thigh, calf, or foot pain, singly or in combination. The severity of symptoms depends upon the number and degree of arterial narrowing, the collateral circulation, and the vigor of extremity use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H497999604\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Intermittent claudication and atypical lower extremity pain'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb-threatening ischemia &ndash; Limb-threatening ischemia presents as ischemic pain, tissue loss, or both. The nature of these manifestations depends upon the time course over which arterial narrowing or occlusion occurs; this in turn affects the extent to which the collateral circulation can develop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 1</a>). Acute reductions in limb perfusion, which may be due to atheroembolism, cholesterol embolism, or thrombotic occlusion of a stenotic vessel, cause diffuse limb pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients with PAD exhibit a wide range of symptoms and associated effects on daily function. The symptomatic treatment of lower extremity PAD is based on a careful assessment of risk factors, medical comorbidities, compliance with pharmacologic treatments and follow-up care, and the subjective values and goals of the patient. Patients with ischemic pain or ulceration may necessarily require early intervention for limb salvage.

The majority of first and recurrent ALI events occurred in those with symptomatic PAD.

Risk factors for PAD are similar to those that promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis (ie, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome). The natural history of PAD in patients who present initially as asymptomatic or with mild to moderate exertional pain (claudication) is relatively benign, which contrasts with the more rapid deterioration often seen in those who initially present with ischemic rest pain or extremity ulceration. (See <a href=\"#H16453406\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive vascular testing is an extension of the vascular history and physical examination and is used to confirm a diagnosis of arterial disease and determine the level and extent of disease. (See <a href=\"#H63305330\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with PAD is aimed at lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease progression and complications and improving symptoms. We recommend initiation of cardiovascular risk reduction strategies for all patients identified with PAD to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and to potentially limit the progression of atherosclerosis. This includes patients identified on screening studies to have PAD but who remain asymptomatic. As with other patients with cardiovascular disease, for patients with PAD, we recommend long-term antithrombotic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Smoking cessation, lipid-lowering therapy, and treatment of diabetes and hypertension are also recommended. (See <a href=\"#H202895399\" class=\"local\">'Risk factor modification'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk#H49\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with lower extremity PAD, in addition to cardiovascular risk reduction strategies, we recommend exercise therapy (for those who can participate), and possibly pharmacologic therapy, rather than initial vascular intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients who can participate in exercise therapy, we suggest supervised rather than unsupervised exercise therapy, where available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who have been compliant with risk reduction strategies, yet six months to one year of exercise therapy and adjunctive pharmacotherapy have failed to provide satisfactory improvement, referral for possible revascularization is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H7904260\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H64226088\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;, section on 'Exercise therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ischemic rest pain or ulceration, where the limb is threatened, revascularization is a priority to restore perfusion and limit tissue loss. Some patients with acute thrombosis superimposed on chronic stenosis or occlusion may benefit from thrombolytic therapy. The role of thrombolytic therapy in such patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H7904260\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H64226088\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with indications for revascularization, options include percutaneous intervention, surgical bypass, or a combination of these. The choice depends upon the level of obstruction (aortoiliac, femoropopliteal), severity of disease, the patient's risk for the intervention, and the goals for care. For patients with lesions that have anatomic features associated with durable clinical success with a percutaneous approach (single, short segment, uniform), we agree with guidelines that suggest an initial attempt at percutaneous revascularization rather than initial surgical revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H64226088\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1183012520\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
