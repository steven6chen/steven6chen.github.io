Close contacts are defined by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as individuals with at least four hours of contact per week. This includes those living in the same household or frequent visitors to the house; it may also include contacts at work or school. Because the risk of developing active disease is very high in the next few years following exposure and new infection, all close contacts should be evaluated for LTBI regardless of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74584 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Most TB control programs evaluate close contacts first and expand the contact investigation to casual contacts if evidence of transmission is found.

In one randomized trial evaluating a three-month regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifapentine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifapentine</a> for treatment of LTBI, serious adverse reactions including hypersensitivity were significantly more common with older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, thus far, data are insufficient to determine appropriate age thresholds for LTBI testing if individuals with a positive test are treated with a shorter rifamycin-based regimen.

Both tests evaluate cell-mediated immunity. General principles for choosing between these tests are discussed below; however, guidelines vary by country. (See <a href=\"#H3430370026\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines vary by country'</a> below.)</p><p>Guidelines for the diagnosis of active and latent tuberculosis (TB) were published in 2017 by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

IGRA is especially useful for patients who are unlikely to return to have the TST read and for patients with a history of Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccination (administered at birth in most TB-endemic countries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The TST is an acceptable alternative to IGRA, especially in situations where IGRA is not available or is too costly (even though it is less specific than the IGRA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with high risk of progression to active disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60941 \">table 3</a>), either the IGRA or TST may be used; in such cases, the higher false-positive rate of the TST is acceptable. A dual testing strategy (perform one test and, if negative, perform the other) may be used, in which a positive result from either test would be considered positive.</p><p/><p>If an IGRA test is needed to confirm a TST result, it has been suggested that blood be drawn for IGRA within three days of TST placement (ie, at the time of the TST reading). This is because prior TST may boost subsequent IGRA results; this phenomenon and its significance for interpretation of the subsequent IGRA result is not fully understood and requires further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In theory, TST boosts IGRA results only in individuals with prior exposure to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> antigens; the TST itself does not induce a cell-mediated immune response to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. However, the studies that described boosting of IGRA by TST were not designed to distinguish whether this occurred only in those with true LTBI. The effect is more apparent in individuals who were already IGRA positive (ie, previously sensitized to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>). In addition, the effect appears to occur in the first few days following TST and wanes after three months. Regardless of uncertainties regarding mechanisms of boosting, a positive IGRA result obtained after prior TST should be interpreted as a positive test for LTBI.</p><p>For individuals with known prior history of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection, the IGRA is preferred over TST since NTM infection may be associated with a false-positive TST result. Exceptions include <em>Mycobacterium kansasii</em> and <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em>, which affect both the TST and IGRA.</p><p>In low-risk situations where LTBI testing is not medically indicated (eg, individuals at low risk for progression to active disease if latent infection is present) but required by law or credentialing bodies, an initial positive test result (IGRA or TST) warrants confirmatory testing (TST if the first test was an IGRA or vice versa); the person should be considered to have LTBI only if both tests are positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Issues related to interpretation of the TST and IGRAs are discussed separately.
