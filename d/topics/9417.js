By extension, they were sometimes used to treat Graves' disease, but by the end of the century, they were considered to be a dangerous form of therapy. They returned to favor in the 1920s as preoperative treatment for hyperthyroidism and were used in the 1930s as the sole therapy for mild hyperthyroidism prior to the introduction of the thionamides. Today, iodine continues to have a minor role in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.</p><p>The role of iodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism will be reviewed here. The treatment of hyperthyroidism in general is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

This is the most acute effect of iodine on thyroid status, occurring within hours of the start of therapy.</p><p>A second effect involves inhibition of iodine organification in the thyroid gland, thereby diminishing thyroid hormone biosynthesis, a phenomenon called the Wolff-Chaikoff effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism are more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of pharmacologic doses of iodine than normal individuals. Thus, iodine is effective in some patients with Graves' disease because it:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acutely ameliorates hyperthyroidism by blocking thyroid hormone release</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis </p><p/><p>The overall inhibitory effect of iodine on serum thyroid hormone concentrations is maximal after approximately 10 days of treatment. However, the inhibitory effect may be transient and is often followed by a return to high thyroid hormone concentrations, although the benefit may be more prolonged, especially in patients who have received radioiodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5852546\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodine is primarily used in the short term (frequently for only one to two weeks but sometimes up to four to six weeks) for the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative preparation for thyroidectomy in Graves' disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive therapy (one week after radioiodine or with thionamides) in Graves' disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of thyroid storm</p><p/><p>We suggest against the routine use of long-term iodine therapy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism.

However, long-term iodine may be of benefit in selected patients, including those with thionamide intolerance and a contraindication or aversion to definitive treatment with radioiodine or surgery. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) task force guidelines for management of hyperthyroidism indicate that there is insufficient evidence to assess benefits or risks for the use of long-term iodine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The long-term use of iodine has been reported for the primary medical treatment of patients with Graves' disease (particularly those with thionamide intolerance) or after unsuccessful radioiodine therapy. It has also been used as the primary treatment of pregnant women with Graves' disease. However, the safety of using iodine for hyperthyroid pregnant women is controversial due to concerns that it might cause fetal goiter or hypothyroidism.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary medical therapy</strong> &ndash; In Japan, the long-term use of potassium iodide has been reported in patients who had adverse reactions to thionamides. In one study of 44 patients, 66 percent were controlled for an average of 18 years (range 9 to 28 years), and 39 percent achieved remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In another Japanese study comparing 20 patients with mild hyperthyroidism treated with potassium iodide and 20 treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>, a similar proportion of patients had normal thyroid function at one year (85 and 95 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most patients receiving potassium iodide were treated with 50 mg daily and had mild thyroid dysfunction at baseline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical therapy after unsuccessful radioiodine treatment</strong> &ndash; The inhibitory effects of iodine on thyroid hormone release and synthesis are greater in patients previously treated with radioiodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, potassium iodide can be given months after radioiodine administration to ameliorate mild persistent hyperthyroidism and to delay or prevent the need for a second radioiodine dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary medical therapy during pregnancy</strong> &ndash; There are insufficient data to recommend routine iodine for the primary treatment of pregnant women with Graves' disease. Older reports suggested that prolonged, high-dose iodine therapy can cause fetal goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, limited data suggest that low-dose potassium iodide is safe during pregnancy and, therefore, may have a potential role for the treatment of pregnant women with mild hyperthyroidism who require therapy but are intolerant of thionamides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment#H2734957024\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Is there a role for iodine as primary therapy for hyperthyroidism?'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Because of the known teratogenicity of antithyroid drugs, a preliminary study from Japan compared 1333 hyperthyroid women with Graves' disease who continued antithyroid drugs during pregnancy with 283 who switched to potassium iodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The incidence of birth defects was lower in the group that switched to iodine (1.5 versus 4.1 percent, respectively), none of the neonates had thyroid dysfunction at birth, and live births were more common in the iodine group (92 versus 85 percent). However, maternal hyperthyroidism was less well controlled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another study from Japan, only 1 of 35 neonates exposed to iodine during pregnancy had subclinical hypothyroidism at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2215996299\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid storm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic regimen for patients with severe hyperthyroidism or thyroid storm typically consists of multiple medications, each of which has a different mechanism of action.

In addition, administration of pharmacologic amounts of iodine inhibits iodine organification in the thyroid gland. In patients with Graves' disease, the iodine-induced blockade of organification persists and can result in amelioration of hyperthyroidism.
