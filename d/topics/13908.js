However, without additional cytotoxic therapy, virtually all of these patients will relapse within a median of four to eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, patients who receive post-remission therapy may expect four-year survival rates as high as 40 percent in young and middle-aged adults.</p><p>Post-remission therapy aims to destroy leukemia cells that survived induction chemotherapy but are undetectable by conventional studies. There are three basic options for post-remission therapy (in order of increasing intensity): consolidation chemotherapy, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), or allogeneic HCT. The choice among these approaches for an individual patient depends upon a number of factors including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected rate of relapse with consolidation chemotherapy alone (influenced strongly by the tumor karyotype)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected morbidity and mortality associated with treatment options (as determined by patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salvage treatments available for the treatment of relapsed disease</p><p/><p>This approach minimizes exposure to potentially toxic therapies in patients expected to respond well to conventional chemotherapy while providing maximum antitumor activity for patients with more difficult-to-treat disease.</p><p>Post-remission therapy for AML in younger adults will be reviewed here. Induction therapy is presented separately, as are the treatment of relapsed disease and the management of complications related to AML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with AML, treatment regimens and outcomes may differ between younger and older adults. Although there is no clear dividing line between younger and older adults when dealing with AML, &quot;older adults&quot; was defined as over age 60 in most studies. The treatment of older adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myeloid-leukemia-treatment-and-outcomes-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myeloid leukemia: Treatment and outcomes in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK STRATIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is strongly recommended that every case of newly diagnosed AML undergo cytogenetic and molecular analysis before starting induction therapy, since specific cytogenetic abnormalities in AML have considerable prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Results from cytogenetic and molecular analyses are essential for World Health Organization (WHO) classification of AML (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110239 \">table 1</a>). Full knowledge of the karyotype determined by metaphase cytogenetics is an essential part of treatment planning and monitoring of the leukemic clone. More recently, information about the genotype based on molecular studies has demonstrated prognostic significance that can be used to guide treatment decisions as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Karyotype'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Remission criteria in acute myeloid leukemia and monitoring for residual disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Stratification by genetic risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of the cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities associated with AML has led to various risk stratification schemata. We prefer the system for risk stratification developed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) that describes three risk categories (ie, favorable, intermediate, adverse) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111588\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111588 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Stratification models that incorporate genetic abnormalities (eg, ELN, WHO) are dynamic and evolving as better understanding of the genetic basis of AML emerges and as additional clinical outcome data become available. Such schemata will result in smaller but more homogeneous subsets of patients with AML, and may increasingly inform therapeutic choices that will involve targeted therapies.</p><p>Further details of the prognostic value of various karyotypic and molecular features in AML are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Karyotype'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytogenetics-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytogenetics in acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FAVORABLE-RISK DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the optimal dose, schedule, and number of cycles are unknown, consolidation chemotherapy with high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (HiDAC) appears to provide the best survival for most patients with favorable-risk disease with the least amount of toxicity. This approach results in overall survival rates at four years of 60 to 75 percent. A randomized trial indicated a disease-free survival benefit when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a> was incorporated into induction and post-remission phases of treatment for patients with core-binding factor AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Administration of consolidation HiDAC'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy versus transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many prospective studies have investigated the use of various post-remission therapies in patients with favorable-risk disease including chemotherapy alone, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), allogeneic HCT, and maintenance therapy. Randomized trials of allogeneic HCT have not been feasible for patients with AML. Instead, investigators have relied on a &quot;genetic randomization&quot; in which patients are assigned to treatment with or without allogeneic HCT based upon the presence or absence of an HLA-matched sibling donor. Patients without an HLA-matched sibling are assigned to treatment with either chemotherapy alone or autologous HCT, depending upon the trial design. Results are then evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis for &quot;donor&quot; and &quot;no donor&quot; (available) treatment groups. As with randomized trials, not all patients in the &quot;donor&quot; group ultimately receive an allogeneic HCT, but they would still be included in the &quot;donor&quot; group for the statistical analysis.</p><p>Three large meta-analyses of these studies performed using data from over 4000 patients with AML in first complete remission (CR) examined the effect of donor availability and cytogenetic risk category on disease-free and overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. There were 480 patients with favorable-risk disease analyzed. In this group, the availability of an HLA-matched sibling did not result in superior disease-free or overall survival, implying no benefit from allogeneic HCT in this risk group. The estimated risk of relapse after consolidation chemotherapy is approximately 35 percent or less in this population. With such a relatively low risk of relapse, the high rate of treatment-related mortality associated with allogeneic HCT (approximately 20 percent) likely negates the effect of a possible small decrease in relapse rate on disease-free or overall survival. A randomized trial also demonstrated that consolidation chemotherapy results in superior survival rates when compared with lower dose maintenance therapy given over an extended period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A decision regarding the use of allogeneic HCT in first remission must also consider the estimated rate of relapse and the efficacy of available treatments at the time of relapse. In one analysis, 494 of 536 younger adults (16 to 49 years) with favorable-risk AML enrolled on prospective trials did not proceed with HCT in their first CR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The 168 (34 percent) patients who relapsed following chemotherapy alone had an estimated five-year survival following relapse of 32 percent. These findings suggest that a significant percentage of patients with favorable-risk disease who defer initial HCT can be effectively treated following relapse. HLA typing should be included in the initial evaluation of these patients to expedite the donor search if the patient relapses.</p><p>For young patients with newly diagnosed AML demonstrating favorable cytogenetics, we recommend post-remission therapy with consolidation chemotherapy rather than either autologous HCT or allogeneic HCT. Post-remission chemotherapy is used in this patient population instead of HCT to avoid the unnecessary risks of acute and chronic morbidity and mortality associated with HCT in a considerable number of patients who may be cured with consolidation chemotherapy alone. HCT is then reserved for use at the time of relapse, if necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H21584407\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>Controversy remains as to whether allogeneic HCT in first CR is of benefit in patients with normal karyotypes that demonstrate certain gene mutations. The European LeukemiaNet classification's favorable risk subgroup includes the following two groups with normal cytogenetics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with normal cytogenetics displaying mutations in both alleles of the nucleophosmin 1 (<em>NPM1</em>) gene but lacking coexistent FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene producing internal transmembrane duplications (<em>FLT3</em>-ITD) mutations </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with normal cytogenetics displaying mutations in the <span class=\"nowrap\">CCAAT/enhancer</span> binding protein alpha (<em>CEBPA</em>) gene </p><p/><p>Support for the use of consolidation chemotherapy in this population comes from the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subjects with a normal karyotype, <em>NPM1</em> mutations, wild-type <em>FLT3</em>, and low levels of <em>ERG</em> appear to have an especially favorable prognosis, with an estimated two-year progression-free survival of 60 to 70 percent after induction treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daunorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> followed by high dose cytarabine or autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from &quot;donor&quot; versus &quot;no donor&quot; analyses demonstrate that a subgroup of cytogenetically normal AML defined by the favorable molecular genotype with <em>NPM1</em> gene mutations but no <em>FLT3</em>-ITD mutations have outcomes similar to those patients with favorable karyotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Such patients derive no overall survival benefit from allogeneic HCT in first CR compared with chemotherapy alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of 124 patients with double mutant <em>CEBPA</em> from cooperative group trials, relapse-free survival was higher following allogeneic HCT (hazard ratio 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.51) or autologous HCT (0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.80) rather than consolidation chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, this improved relapse-free survival did not translate into an overall survival benefit, largely due to a high rate of second CR and survival after allogeneic HCT at the time of relapse.</p><p/><p>Thus, a subset of patients with normal karyotype may not require an allogeneic HCT. Given the controversy surrounding this group of patients, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Outside of a clinical trial, any of the above approaches may be offered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (HiDAC) has been the consolidation chemotherapy of choice in patients with favorable-risk disease for more than two decades. Attempts to improve survival rates over those attained with HiDAC by altering the dose or schedule of cytarabine, substituting other agents, or alternating courses with two drug combinations have shown similar efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/2,15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15-23</a>]. </p><p>Trials using alternating courses of two-drug combinations have demonstrated similarly favorable outcomes, and offer equally effective alternative options.

HiDAC produces high intracellular drug concentrations, which saturate the deaminating metabolic enzyme pathway, leading to increased levels of the active agent ara-cytidine triphosphate. In this way, HiDAC can often effectively eliminate minimal residual disease that survived induction with cytarabine containing regimens.</p><p>A variety of HiDAC doses and schedules have been used in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> are preferable to lower doses (as described below), but the ideal dose remains unknown and there is likely a dose above which additional cytarabine is not of benefit.

There were 603 patients with intermediate-risk disease analyzed. In an intention-to-treat analysis, patients &quot;genetically assigned&quot; to matched related donor HCT (ie, those who had an HLA-matched sibling) had superior rates of four-year disease-free survival. While overall survival did not reach statistical significance in the first meta-analysis, combination of the data from these three meta-analyses demonstrated a benefit in overall survival implying that allogeneic HCT was beneficial for patients in this risk group overall. Such results were particularly noticeable for patients younger than age 35 years who tolerate the morbidity from HCT better.</p><p>A decision regarding the use of allogeneic HCT in first CR must also consider the estimated rate of relapse and the efficacy of available treatments at the time of relapse. In one analysis, 1337 of 2029 younger adults (16 to 49 years) with intermediate-risk AML enrolled on prospective trials did not proceed with HCT in first CR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of these, 780 (58 percent) relapsed with an estimated five-year survival following relapse of 17 percent. Among patients with relapsed disease, survival was superior for the 326 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT after relapse (47 versus 15 percent). In this particular (time-dependent) analysis, there was a similar difference in survival outcome for patients who had allogeneic HCT in first CR and for those who did not undergo HCT in first CR but underwent a late HCT for salvage after relapse of leukemia.</p><p>The choice of post-remission therapy for an individual with intermediate-risk disease depends upon the patient's age and comorbidities. Advances in conditioning regimens (eg, non-myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning) and alternative donor sources (eg, umbilical cord blood, haploidentical donors) have increased the number of patients with intermediate-risk disease who are candidates for allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Age and comorbidities are host factors that define the mortality risk of the transplant and which can be taken into account in relation to the risk of relapse of the disease. As an example, young patients (eg, &lt;40 years old) with few comorbidities may choose allogeneic HCT rather than autologous HCT or HiDAC. This preference places a strong emphasis on the survival benefit seen on meta-analysis and a lesser emphasis on the high rate of treatment related mortality and morbidity. A post-remission treatment calculator has been proposed that incorporates age, percentage of CD34 positive blasts, <em>FLT3</em>-ITD mutant-to-wild-type ratio, cytogenetic risk, and disease status to predict probability of survival with these therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Furthermore, we suggest myeloablative conditioning rather than reduced intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning. Enrollment in a clinical trial is advised if a related or unrelated donor is not available or if the patient is not a candidate for transplantation.</p><p>Patients with unfavorable karyotypes, as defined above, do poorly when treated with consolidation chemotherapy alone after attainment of a complete remission; rates of five-year overall survival with this approach are 15 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/2,3,7,10,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7,10,29</a>].

All patients were considered to be candidates for RIC, and &quot;genetic randomization&quot; was used to assign treatment with or without allogeneic HCT based upon the presence or absence of an HLA-matched sibling donor. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, patients with an HLA-matched sibling donor had significantly higher estimated rates of leukemia-free survival at seven years (60 versus 23 percent). Treatment-related mortality for those who underwent RIC was 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study employed NMA conditioning using 2 Gy total body radiation with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> in 122 patients with AML, most of whom were considered ineligible for conventional allogeneic HCT because of older age or comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

The frequency and extent of these visits depends upon the comfort of both the patient and physician. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up.</p><p>Maintenance therapy alone, using relatively nonmyelosuppressive doses of cytotoxic drugs following remission induction, has no proven benefit in the cure of AML. For patients under 60 years of age, consolidation therapy results in significantly longer survival than maintenance therapy alone. Clinical trials are investigating the use of agents such as interleukin 2 or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a> as a maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to patient surveillance is to schedule patient visits every one to two months for the first two years when the disease is most likely to relapse, and then every three to six months for up to five years post-consolidation. At these visits we perform a complete blood count including platelets, white blood cell differential, and review of the peripheral blood smear.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remission induction &ndash; The first goal of treatment is attainment of a complete remission with rapid restoration of normal bone marrow function.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>As more details about the genetic abnormalities found in AML have been realized, risk stratification schemas have undergone multiple revisions. It is likely that these will change further as we learn more about the effect of gene mutations and microRNA expression, especially in patients with cytogenetically normal AML. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-remission therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with favorable cytogenetics (ie, t(8;21), inv(16), or t(16;16)), we recommend consolidation treatment with three or more courses of high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (ie, &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> rather than standard dose cytarabine, alternative chemotherapeutic agents, or early HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Favorable-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, including a normal karyotype, selection of treatment (eg, chemotherapy versus transplantation) should be based on individual patient features (eg, age, initial white blood cell count, ease of remission induction, comorbidities, and evidence for minimal residual disease), patient preference, donor availability, and access to specific clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics, we recommend allogeneic HCT in first remission for appropriate candidates rather than consolidation with autologous HCT or chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Availability of a matched donor is the prerequisite, and HLA typing of the patient should be done at diagnosis so that a donor search is not delayed. Registry data suggest that there is no advantage to giving one or more cycles of consolidation therapy after achievement of a complete remission and prior to allogeneic transplantation as long as the transplant is not delayed more than several weeks after remission induction. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Unfavorable-risk disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most younger adults (&lt;40 years) undergoing allogeneic HCT, we suggest myeloablative conditioning rather than reduced intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In contrast, reduced intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic HCT is preferred over consolidation chemotherapy for eligible patients with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics who are not candidates for myeloablative conditioning.
