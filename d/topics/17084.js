This is clinically inconsequential in healthy adults, but can be detrimental in patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders because they rely on an increased central neural output to compensate for weak ventilatory muscles, maintain their increased work of breathing, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, these patients may fail to maintain a normal level of ventilation when central neural output decreases during sleep.</p><p>The increased work of breathing may be a consequence of abnormally low lung and chest wall compliance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65040\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65040 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The reduced lung compliance may be due to microatelectasis and focal pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis, while the reduced chest wall compliance may be due to increased stiffness of the rib cage. Ankylosis of rib cage joints, fibrosis or spasticity of rib cage muscles, or loss of parasternal intercostal activity may all contribute to stiffening of the rib cage in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diaphragmatic burden</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inspiratory intercostal and accessory respiratory muscle activity increases during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep compared with wakefulness, but the activity of the diaphragm remains unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In contrast, inspiratory intercostal and accessory muscle activity decreases during REM sleep, while diaphragmatic activity increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. This shifts the burden of maintaining ventilation to the diaphragm during REM sleep.</p><p>The increased diaphragmatic burden does not have significant clinical implications in healthy adults. However, patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders may have a weak or mechanically disadvantaged diaphragm that is incapable of overcoming this load. This increases the risk of hypoventilation during REM sleep in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper airway resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper airway resistance may increase during normal NREM sleep, compared to wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/6,10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-16</a>]. In addition, load compensation (the physiologic changes elicited to maintain normal ventilation in presence of increased upper airway resistance) may decrease during sleep.</p><p>The combination of increased upper airway resistance and reduced ventilatory muscle function may lead to hypoventilation during sleep in patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders. The risk for hypoventilation may be enhanced by decreased load compensation that occurs in conjunction with sleep. Deficits in regulation of respiratory timing to both elastic and resistive loading have been found in small samples of awake patients with spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>There are, in fact, conflicting data regarding the importance of sleep-related increases in upper airway resistance and whether load compensation exists. Some studies have found minimal or no immediate response to a resistive load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/14,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,19</a>]. Others have found augmented ventilatory muscle activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. When present, this augmentation may represent a response to a resistive load itself or the elevation of arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) that results when load compensation is incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The differing observations across studies may be related to differences in the magnitude of the resistive loads used in the various studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemosensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal sleep is associated with changes in the ventilatory response to chemostimuli (hypoxemia, hypercapnia). Combined with reduced ventilatory muscle strength, abnormal lung or chest wall stiffness, or both, these changes enhance the risk for pathologic hypoventilation during sleep in patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ventilatory response to hypoxic chemostimulation is decreased during NREM sleep in men, compared with wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Such a change in PaO<sub>2</sub> typically reduces oxyhemoglobin saturation by less than 3 percentage points.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10558409\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxyhemoglobin desaturation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep may be accentuated in patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F61245\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61245 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. In one study of 92 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a mean vital capacity of 49 to 56 percent of predicted, the mean sleep time with an oxyhemoglobin saturation &lt;90 percent was 23 to 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The decreased oxyhemoglobin saturation was most pronounced during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In another study of patients with ALS and a mean forced vital capacity of &lt;50 percent, the mean nadir oxyhemoglobin saturation was 85 percent during the use of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Both acute and chronic hypoxia have been associated with alterations in hypoxia inducible-factor 1-alpha expression in the monocytes of patients with ALS compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], which carries clinical implications regarding exposure to hypoxia and progression of motor neuron dysfunction in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptom-based-management-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptom-based management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Respiratory management'</a>.)</p><p>Hypoventilation is a likely cause of abnormal decreases in oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep. This explanation is supported by an observational study of 26 patients with a mixture of respiratory disorders, which found that a reduced minute volume due to decreased tidal volume was associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other etiologies, including ventilation-perfusion mismatching and rightward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, are also possible contributors that have not been investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10558416\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercapnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Awake hypercapnia may occur when lung stiffness, chest wall stiffness, or both are increased relative to the strength or endurance of the inspiratory muscles. This was demonstrated by an observational study that compared 20 patients with neuromuscular diseases to 17 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Decreased sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (indicating respiratory muscle weakness) and increased dynamic lung elastance (indicating poor compliance) were associated with rapid, low tidal volume breathing and daytime hypercapnia. This has not been specifically examined during sleep; however, the increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> is likely to be initially manifested during sleep in view of the other sleep-related physiologic changes described above (altered ventilatory muscle activity, increased upper airway resistance, altered chemosensitivity).</p><p>Sleep-related hypercapnia may itself contribute to awake hypercapnia. This occurs because a persistently elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub> during sleep may lead to increased serum bicarbonate and buffering capacity, which persists into wakefulness. This is supported by two key observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent positive pressure ventilation during sleep was associated with an augmented ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and a decreased PaCO<sub>2</sub> during wakefulness in an uncontrolled trial that included 16 patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The findings during wakefulness were likely a consequence of improved ventilation and decreased PaCO<sub>2</sub> during sleep, although arterial blood gases were not reported (decreased serum bicarbonate provided evidence that PaCO<sub>2</sub> decreased). Changes in pulmonary function or respiratory muscle strength did not explain the findings and the potential contribution of relief of nocturnal hypoxia was not addressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overnight hypercapnia may precede daytime hypercapnia. In an observational study of six patients with a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (in whom elevated awake PaCO<sub>2</sub> decreased following initiation of nocturnal noninvasive positive airway pressure), positive airway pressure ventilation was withheld for an average of one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation and transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension worsened, without a change in daytime blood gases, pulmonary function, or ventilatory muscle strength. Presumably, the daytime blood gases would have worsened to pre-treatment levels if the nocturnal noninvasive ventilation was withheld for a longer duration.</p><p/><p>An additional or alternative hypothesis is that blunting of the awake ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is contributed to by sleep deprivation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fragmentation. According to this proposal, the improved ventilatory response to hypercapnia during wakefulness that follows intermittent positive pressure ventilation during sleep is due to improved sleep continuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, subsequent studies in normal subjects provide compelling evidence that neither experimental sleep deprivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] nor fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] is associated with a reduced ventilatory response to hypercapnia. It is unclear, however, how these data apply to humans with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders.</p><p>An observational study in patients with adult-onset myotonic dystrophy type 1 showed only a weak association between the underlying genetic abnormality and awake respiratory abnormalities (specifically, the degree of perturbed oxyhemoglobin saturation and maximal expiratory pressure); this association was no longer present after adjusting for potential confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-effect-of-sleep-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disorders/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal sleep-related changes that impact ventilation include decreased central neural output, a shift of the respiratory burden onto the diaphragm, increased upper airway resistance, and decreased responsiveness to hypoxemia and hypercapnia (chemosensitivity). These perturbations are clinically insignificant in healthy adults, but can induce or exacerbate hypoventilation and hypoxemia during sleep in patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders.
