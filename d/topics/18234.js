Pelvic ultrasound is typically the first-line imaging study used to characterize an adnexal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adnexal masses may present as pelvic pain or pressure and may be found on pelvic examination or be an incidental finding on pelvic imaging.</p><p>A principal concern regarding adnexal masses is whether a malignancy is present. Sonographic findings enable imagers to establish when an adnexal mass is almost certainly benign compared with when an adnexal mass has a reasonable chance of being malignant. Characterization of the mass into one of these two categories is of paramount importance, since clinical management of the mass will greatly depend upon this categorization.</p><p>The sonographic findings that help to distinguish a benign from a malignant adnexal mass are reviewed here. The general diagnostic approach and differential diagnosis of adnexal masses are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23238815\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF SONOGRAPHIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sonographic approach to the evaluation of adnexal masses is based upon the ability to evaluate the likelihood of malignancy and also to recognize masses that are consistent with a normal physiologic structure or a benign neoplasm. To accomplish this, the sonologist must take into consideration normal and abnormal anatomy and physiology, clinical information, and ultrasound techniques, and they must set appropriate diagnostic thresholds to help guide further management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693729361\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of sonographic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of ultrasound evaluation of the adnexal mass is not, strictly speaking, to determine if the mass is &quot;definitely&quot; benign versus &quot;definitely&quot; malignant. Instead, the goal is to determine whether the mass is almost certainly benign or whether the mass has some reasonable chance of being malignant.</p><p>The asymmetry in these categories with respect to specificity is purposeful. The adnexal mass that is &quot;almost certainly benign&quot; should have practically no risk for malignancy (very high specificity). Thus, it should be reasonable not to proceed with surgical intervention in these cases. Some of these masses may require surgical intervention or imaging follow-up for reasons other than excluding malignancy. On the other hand, some of the adnexal masses that ultrasound characterizes as having &quot;a reasonable chance of being malignant&quot; may in fact turn out to be benign (higher sensitivity but lower specificity), but these masses require therapeutic or diagnostic intervention because the goal is to detect nearly all malignant masses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2758087919\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy and physiology of adnexal masses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomically, most adnexal masses arise from the ovary or fallopian tube. However, other gynecologic structures may give rise to an adnexal mass, including the mesovarium or mesosalpinx (eg, paratubal cysts). Uterine leiomyomas may protrude toward the adnexa and be palpated or visualized as an adnexal mass. In addition, adnexal masses may arise from other proximal structures, including the urinary tract (eg, bladder diverticulum), bowel (eg, appendiceal abscess, diverticular abscess, bowel neoplasm), or pelvic connective tissue (eg, peritoneal cyst) or nerves (nerve sheath tumor). The types of adnexal masses are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In terms of physiology and histology, adnexal masses may be physiologic (a normal component of ovulation) or pathologic. Normal ovulatory physiology is the most common cause of an adnexal mass in premenopausal women. Thus, the sonographic identification of features in an adnexal mass that give an interpretation that the mass is one arising from normal physiology is one of the most important ways to identify a mass as being benign. A brief review of normal menstrual cycle physiology is essential to understanding the sonographic approach.</p><p>Most physiologic masses are cystic. In general, the chance of a malignancy is low if there are no solid areas in the mass on sonographic evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107861\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107861 \">table 2</a>). This becomes one of the most important principles that underlie the sonographic approach to the adnexal mass.</p><p>During the menstrual cycle, normal physiology results in establishment of typically one (but occasionally more than one) dominant follicle in either or both ovaries, which is usually around 20 to 25 mm in diameter at ovulation. Prior to ovulation, the dominant follicle is round, has a smooth wall, and is internally anechoic on ultrasound imaging; if the follicle wall seals quickly after ovulation, the resultant corpus luteum cyst can also exhibit the same sonographic features and may be larger than the dominant follicle from which it arose. Cysts that exhibit these imaging characteristics are termed &quot;simple cysts&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66655\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66655 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>In premenopausal women, upon release of an oocyte, the dominant follicle usually loses most or all of its internal fluid, collapsing into a sonographically &quot;solid&quot; appearing structure, with thickened crenulated walls &ndash; the corpus luteum. Sometimes follicles, dominant follicles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the corpus luteum will develop internal hemorrhage which causes cyst enlargement; when this occurs, it happens most commonly at the time of ovulation, resulting in a hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83933\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83933 \">image 2</a>). Hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts are typically 3 to 5 cm in diameter but can be larger. Evidence now shows that sporadic ovulation can occur in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but when this occurs, it almost always happens within the first few years following the final menstrual period; thus the existence of a non-neoplastic hemorrhagic cyst in a postmenopausal woman is possible in the first five years following the final menstrual period but very uncommon. When there are sonographic features characteristic of hemorrhage into a cyst without solid areas (as detailed below), there is a strong presumption that the cyst is physiologic.</p><p>It was previously believed that physiologic ovarian cysts were almost exclusively a premenopausal phenomenon, but there is now substantial evidence to indicate that simple ovarian cysts are also routinely found in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], in many cases believed to be arrested physiologic follicles from an anovulatory cycle. They are usually smaller and less frequently encountered with increasing time interval from the final menstrual period. All of these ovarian &quot;simple cysts&quot; &ndash; follicles, dominant follicles, corpus luteum, and arrested physiologic cysts &ndash; can be grouped together as physiologic non-neoplastic cysts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1493751381\"><span class=\"h2\">Sonographic techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adnexal masses can be characterized using pelvic gray-scale sonography alone or with addition of color Doppler evaluation.</p><p>The basic principle of ultrasound imaging is that ultrasound waves are delivered into the body from the crystal surface of a hand-held transducer, which then also records the waves that are reflected back to the crystal (&quot;echoes&quot;) from internal structures and interfaces.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103622377\"><span class=\"h3\">Gray-scale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gray-scale ultrasound imaging refers to the technique in which the reflected ultrasound wave is displayed on the image as a pixel of a particular shade of gray based on the signal intensity, with the depth of the pixel on the image based on the time it took for the reflected wave to return to the crystal. This results in a two-dimensional display of anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4277805629\"><span class=\"h3\">Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler evaluation refers to the change in frequency that results from sound waves that reflect off of moving particles, such as blood flow. In ultrasound imaging, those Doppler changes can be displayed using color maps (known as color Doppler) or as a waveform showing the change in frequency as a function of time (known as spectral Doppler).</p><p>Using color Doppler evaluation during pelvic ultrasound is a routine maneuver that is usually considered part of a standard evaluation and not an additional test. In particular, for adnexal masses that do not have a typical benign appearance, using color or power Doppler to look for the presence or absence of flow in solid areas or septations can be useful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52113\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52113 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75776\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75776 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3591184355\"><span class=\"h3\">Combined gray-scale and Doppler evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analyses of observational studies concluded that combined evaluation of ovarian masses with gray-scale morphology and color Doppler assessment performed better than morphologic assessment, pulsed Doppler assessment, or color Doppler assessment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Combined evaluation can be performed with the use of a scoring system, in which numerical values are assigned to different features and a total score calculated for the mass or a probability of malignancy can be calculated. In daily practice, however, many experienced sonologists will use the features that individual studies have identified as most valuable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>] to arrive at a subjective impression of the likelihood of malignancy. Using gray-scale and color Doppler features is a subjective approach that has been shown to be highly reliable and usually superior to other methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

The neovascularization that accompanies malignant tumors is associated with poor muscular support in the arterial walls, leading to less vascular resistance that potentially can be detected by pulsed Doppler. However, spectral Doppler does not appear to be useful in diagnosing ovarian malignancy, as many studies have found too broad an overlap in resistive index and pulsatility index between benign and malignant masses. Other spectral Doppler features, such as velocity criteria or the presence or absence of a diastolic notch in the pulsed Doppler waveform, have been investigated and are generally not found to be reliable for differentiating benign and malignant masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/7,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16,17</a>], although some believe them to be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H579334644\"><span class=\"h2\">Pertinent clinical information</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical characteristics can help in formulating a differential diagnosis and the sonographic evaluation of adnexal pathology must account for the clinical context.</p><p>Clinical examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubo-ovarian abscesses, for example, may have a gray-scale sonographic appearance that would be worrisome for malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60914 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77543\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77543 \">image 5</a>), but the presence of fever, leukocytosis, and pelvic tenderness helps to suggest the correct diagnosis.

More advanced disease may be associated with abdominal distention, nausea, anorexia, or early satiety due to the presence of ascites and omental or bowel metastases. Unfortunately, these clinical findings are rarely useful in helping to distinguish benign and malignant disease when the sonographic findings are indeterminate.

Many of these studies have important limitations. First, it should be noted that the presence or absence of demonstrable color Doppler flow is an evaluated feature of some of these studies, but the use of color Doppler is considered an inherent aspect of the &quot;sonographic evaluation.&quot; It is misleading to think that Doppler evaluation is an ancillary or follow-up test after gray-scale ultrasound. Second, it should be recognized that a dichotomous approach (benign versus malignant) does not reflect the goal of the ultrasound examination as describe above (&quot;almost certainly benign&quot; or &quot;reasonable chance of malignancy&quot;). In making this determination, the expertise of the sonologist influences the likelihood of arriving at a correct diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This last point was illustrated in a multicenter study reporting that 90 percent of extrauterine masses could be correctly classified by the expert sonologist as &quot;definitely benign&quot; or &quot;definitely malignant&quot; with 100 percent accuracy, but 10 percent were unclassifiable by their ultrasound findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These unclassifiable masses, which were neither &quot;definitely malignant&quot; nor &quot;definitely benign&quot; as analyzed by the sonologist, were usually borderline tumors, struma ovarii, papillary cystadenofibromas, or myomas; these are among the adnexal masses that have higher chance of being misclassified as benign or malignant if one takes a dichotomous approach.</p><p>The largest diagnostic accuracy study regarding sonographic differentiation of benign and malignant adnexal masses was the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) study, an international multicenter prospective study the evaluated the use of a set of sonographic features (the &quot;Simple Rules&quot;) in almost 5000 women with adnexal masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The IOTA data show that the performance of ultrasound depends upon which level of &quot;risk of malignancy&quot; one is willing to accept for patients who are deemed NOT to have a malignancy based on any algorithm using sonographic features. For example, if one pursues a strategy in which an adnexal mass that is deemed not to be malignant based on certain sonographic findings has only 1 percent risk of being malignant (high <span class=\"nowrap\">sensitivity/low</span> specificity), then ultrasound shows 99.7 percent sensitivity, 33.7 percent specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) 44.8 percent, and negative predictive value (NPV) 98.9 percent. Alternatively, if one pursues a strategy in which an adnexal mass deemed not to be malignant based on certain sonographic findings has 30 percent risk of malignancy, ultrasound sensitivity was 89.0 percent, specificity 84.7, PPV 75.4 percent, and NPV 93.9 percent. In a meta-analysis comparing the ability of 19 methods to discriminate between benign and malignant adnexal masses before surgery, the Simple Rules had a sensitivity of 93 percent and a specificity of 81 percent when inconclusive tumors were all considered malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The Simple Rules are described in detail below.

Simple cysts are characterized by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anechoic fluid filling the cyst cavity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thin walls</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal acoustic enhancement &ndash; No impairment of sound transmission through the mass (in other words, no loss of signal from tissues behind the cyst)</p><p/><p>In <strong>premenopausal women</strong>, simple adnexal cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66655\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66655 \">image 1</a>) that are &lt;3 cm in diameter typically represent normal follicles and may be considered a normal finding. Even when up to 5 cm in diameter, these simple cysts are so commonly due to normal menstrual physiology that the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) does not recommend follow-up when asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In 2010, the SRU published a consensus approach to management of asymptomatic adnexal findings identified on ultrasound based on sonographic features including size. Understandably, the SRU approach does not apply to symptomatic adnexal findings, in which the clinical context may be more important than the sonographic findings. In premenopausal women, the SRU consensus is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic simple cysts between 5 and 7 cm should undergo yearly sonographic evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a simple cysts exceeds 7 cm in size, the SRU suggests that magnetic resonance imaging be considered if the cyst was not thoroughly evaluated sonographically due to potential technical limitations.</p><p/><p>In <strong>postmenopausal women</strong>, because malignancy in a simple cysts is rare, the SRU consensus is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practices may choose any threshold from 1 to 3 cm as a justifiable cut-off for not following a simple cyst in a postmenopausal woman.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yearly sonographic follow-up for simple cysts in postmenopausal women above the chosen threshold (whatever threshold the practice chooses, between 1 to 3 cm, based on how aggressively the practice wants to pursue the distinction between a non-neoplastic cyst and a benign neoplasm in an asymptomatic patient).</p><p/><p>Any selected number in this 1 to 3 cm range is acceptable, and this is based on the limited available data about rare ovarian cancers that appeared as simple cysts on ultrasound. In these reports, rare ovarian cysts over 5 cm in diameter in postmenopausal women have been reported as simple on ultrasound but turned out to be borderline tumors with nodularity noted grossly or histologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Given the presence of gross nodules at pathology, it is likely that these cysts were not well evaluated on sonography.

For example, when a cyst has complex features that are worrisome for a neoplasm but may still potentially be due to hemorrhage, short interval follow-up sonographic evaluation can be invaluable. In this situation, the imager might be unable to conclude that the cyst is &quot;almost certainly benign.&quot; The impression may also be consistent with the possibility that hemorrhage in a physiologic cyst could account for the features that simulate neoplasm. In such cases, there is a concern of subjecting the patient to surgical evaluation that may prove unnecessary.

MRI can demonstrate findings that lead to a confident diagnosis of a particular entity.</p><p>One indication for follow-up imaging with MRI is further evaluation when it appears that an adnexal mass may be an exophytic leiomyoma. This is a particularly good use of MRI because an exophytic myoma generally does not need operative intervention, whereas a solid adnexal mass that is not an exophytic myoma almost always needs surgical removal. This highlights the underlying principle that further characterization of an adnexal mass with MRI is most useful when the results change the gynecologic approach to management of the mass.</p><p>As another example, if the imager thinks that an adnexal mass is probably a benign cystic teratoma based on sonographic appearance but does not have enough confidence in concluding that malignancy is practically excluded (let us say 1 percent chance or less), MRI would be of tremendous additional value but only if it was used to change who or where the surgical treatment was performed.</p><p>If the surgeon removing the tumor has oncologic training and is able to effective stage ovarian cancer if the mass does prove to be malignant, then preoperative MRI distinction between a benign cystic teratoma and an ovarian malignancy may not be really needed; on the other hand, if the gynecologist planning to remove the mass is comfortable with removing a benign cystic teratoma but not experienced in surgical staging of ovarian malignancy, then preoperative distinction between those two possibilities becomes of tremendous value.

Endometriomas, dermoids, hydrosalpinges, peritoneal inclusion cysts, and pedunculated fibroids are all entities that can exhibit characteristic features. (See <a href=\"#H23239117\" class=\"local\">'Step three: Are there characteristics of specific entities?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adnexal masses that are suspicious for malignancy are those with the following characteristics (see <a href=\"#H23239161\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Solid component that is not hyperechoic and is often nodular or papillary</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Septations, if present, that are irregularly thick (&gt;2 to 3 mm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Color or power Doppler demonstration of flow in the solid component</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of ascites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peritoneal masses, enlarged nodes, or matted bowel (may be difficult to detect by ultrasound)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, sonographic features are indeterminate or ultrasound images are suboptimal. Follow-up with other imaging modalities or combinations of tests may be useful as a fourth step.
