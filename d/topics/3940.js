This condition is typically the end result of a variety of pathophysiologic processes that render the bronchial walls weakened, easily collapsible, chronically inflamed, and plugged with mucus secretions. Associated findings include atelectasis, emphysema, fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the bronchial vasculature.</p><p>In developed nations, cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of bronchiectasis in children. The evaluation of CF-related bronchiectasis is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations of pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bronchiectasis can be caused by a variety of disease processes other than CF, most of which include some combination of bronchial obstruction and infection. The types of disorders that cause bronchiectasis vary among populations and age groups. Infections and acquired causes of bronchiectasis are more common in adults and in developing nations, whereas congenital anomalies of the bronchi or immune system are more prominent in children and in industrialized nations.</p><p>This topic review will outline the clinical manifestations and evaluation of non-CF-related bronchiectasis in children. The causes and management of non-CF-related bronchiectasis in children, and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchiectasis in children without cystic fibrosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom in children with bronchiectasis is persistent cough, which is present in 80 to 90 percent of pediatric patients with bronchiectasis, and is typically &quot;wet&quot; or productive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Fifty-seven to 74 percent of children also produce purulent sputum. The absence of sputum production does not exclude bronchiectasis because young children may not be able to expectorate sputum.</p><p>Some patients present with episodic exacerbations of infection, characterized by increased cough and sputum production that may be associated with fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. These exacerbations typically respond to antibiotic therapies.</p><p>Although hemoptysis is common in adults, it is uncommon in children, reported in only 4 to 7 percent of those with bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Hemoptysis is caused by erosion of inflamed airway tissue adjacent to pulmonary vessels. The amount of bleeding can range from mild, with blood streaked sputum, to profuse amounts of fresh blood if the systemic bronchial vessels are eroded.</p><p>Dyspnea and exercise intolerance are uncommon at presentation but may develop as the disease progresses, or may occur during an acute exacerbation of the disease due to intercurrent infection. Children with severe bronchiectatic lung disease may have cyanosis, indicating severe hypoxemia due to mismatched pulmonary ventilation and perfusion. If the hypoxemia is prolonged and profound, it may lead to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.</p><p>Other symptoms related to the underlying cause for bronchiectasis may be seen at presentation. For example, failure to thrive is frequently seen in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and immunodeficiency disorders. Chronic sinusitis is common among children with CF, ciliary dysfunction disorders, and immunodeficiencies. Chronic ear infection with or without otorrhea is an additional characteristic of ciliary dysfunction. The presence of congenital anomalies should alert the clinician to the possibility of associated anomalies that predispose to bronchiectasis (eg, congenital heart disease and anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree in the VACTERL association). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;, section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the evaluation are to confirm the diagnosis of bronchiectasis, identify the underlying etiology and any potentially treatable causes, and to assess the severity of pulmonary disease.</p><p>A variety of underlying disease processes can cause bronchiectasis; the cause should be determined whenever possible because this may direct treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87712 \">table 1</a>).

In patients with cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, the radiographic abnormalities are often concentrated in the upper lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], whereas centrally located bronchiectasis is characteristic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In patients with bronchopulmonary sequestration, bronchiectasis is usually unilateral and in a lower lobe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71732 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchopulmonary-sequestration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic features that suggest a specific disorder include increased caliber of the trachea and central airways (congenital tracheobronchomegaly, Mounier-Kuhn syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], or unilateral hyperlucent lung (Swyer James syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A single focal area of bronchiectasis raises the possibility of airway obstruction by extrinsic compression, airway foreign body, or congenital airway abnormality. Recurrent atelectasis and progressive bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe or lingula suggest middle lobe syndrome, particularly in a patient with asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children#H2794234\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;, section on 'Bronchial narrowing or obstruction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children#H2793993\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;, section on 'Acquired bronchial obstruction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">HRCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the most sensitive imaging method to detect bronchiectasis, and should be performed when the chest radiograph is normal or nonspecific in a patient with clinically suspected bronchiectasis. The sensitivity of HRCT for detecting bronchiectasis ranges from 82 to 97 percent when compared to the gold standard of bronchography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, the diagnosis of bronchiectasis is made when the internal diameter of the airway is larger than the diameter of the adjacent artery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchi, visualized within 2 cm of the pleural surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], in association with chronic productive cough. One study suggests that a bronchoarterial ratio &gt;0.76 should be considered abnormal in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the same authors note that asthma can also cause bronchial wall thickening and dilation. Airway wall thickening (&quot;signet ring&quot; shadows) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73028\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73028 \">image 2</a>) with or without air fluid levels, volume loss, mucus plugging, and air trapping can also be seen on the CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68555\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68555 \">image 3</a>).

In addition, patients should be tested for immunodeficiency, including a complete blood count with differential, immunoglobulin M&nbsp;(IgM), immunoglobulin A&nbsp;(IgA) and immunoglobulin G&nbsp;(IgG), and a humoral panel (immune response to childhood vaccines, specifically antitetanus, antidiphtheria, and antipneumococcal antibodies).

This is more commonly seen in patients with neurologic dysfunction. In such patients, this possibility should be evaluated by a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-due-to-swallowing-dysfunction-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in infants and children&quot;</a>). Additional testing for patients in whom recurrent aspiration is suspected may include pH monitoring, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and nuclear scintigraphy. However, none of these tests provide definitive evidence that gastroesophageal reflux is the cause of the recurrent pneumonia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Recurrent pneumonia'</a>).

Important causes of bronchiectasis in children include cystic fibrosis, chronic aspiration, infection (with or without underlying immunodeficiency), foreign body aspiration, and congenital pulmonary defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87712 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signs and symptoms of bronchiectasis are nonspecific. The most common presenting symptom in children with bronchiectasis is a persistent &quot;wet&quot; cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent pneumonia. Crackles and rhonchi are often heard over the area of bronchiectasis; wheezing is less common. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On chest radiograph, findings that are suspicious for bronchiectasis include linear atelectasis and dilated and thickened airways (ie, tram-tracking or parallel lines on longitudinal view, or ring shadows on cross section) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56034\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56034 \">image 1</a>). High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the most sensitive imaging method to detect bronchiectasis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with diffusely distributed bronchiectasis, the minimum evaluation includes testing for cystic fibrosis (sweat chloride <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DNA testing) and immunodeficiency (including complete blood count with differential, immunoglobulins, and IgG subclasses). Ciliary dyskinesia should be considered in patients with recurrent sinus and ear infections, and evaluated with a ciliary biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic aspiration should be considered in patients with recurrent pneumonia, particularly those with neurologic dysfunction. Potential mechanisms of aspiration should be assessed using videofluoroscopy, esophageal pH monitoring, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nuclear scintigraphy. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy should be performed if laryngeal clefts or tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) are suspected. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with focal bronchiectasis, imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchoscopy should be performed to assess for airway obstruction (eg, airway foreign body or congenital pulmonary anomalies). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other tests'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Karakoc GB, Yilmaz M, Altintas DU, Kendirli SG.
