The mitral valve is between the left atrium and left ventricle. The mitral valve is made up of 2 flaps. In mitral valve prolapse, one or both flaps billow or bulge into the left atrium.</p><p>When the heart valves work normally, they keep blood flowing in only one direction. The mitral valve normally keeps blood flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58389 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>When the mitral valve flaps don't close correctly, blood can leak backward in the wrong direction. When blood leaks backward from the left ventricle to the left atrium, doctors call it &quot;mitral regurgitation.&quot; Some patients with mitral valve prolapse have mitral regurgitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667903896\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes mitral valve prolapse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral valve prolapse can happen on its own, because the valve can get damaged over time. It can also happen as a result of another medical condition. For example, &quot;connective-tissue diseases,&quot; which are diseases that affect certain tissues in the body, can cause mitral valve prolapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667903911\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with mitral valve prolapse have no symptoms. Their doctor or nurse will find out they have it during an exam. The doctor or nurse will hear a &quot;click&quot; or heart murmur when he or she listens to the heart with a stethoscope. A heart murmur is an abnormal sound that often sounds like an extra &quot;whoosh&quot; or &quot;swish&quot; in the heartbeat.</p><p>Some people with mitral valve prolapse have symptoms such as chest pain, feeling their heart beating fast or hard, fainting, or feeling dizzy. Even though these symptoms sometimes happen in people with mitral valve prolapse, these symptoms might not be caused by the mitral valve prolapse.</p><p>Mitral valve prolapse can be mild or severe. It sometimes also leads to serious problems. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral regurgitation &ndash; This usually causes no symptoms until it is severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocarditis, which is when a heart valve gets infected &ndash; This can cause a fever and make people feel tired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rhythm problems &ndash; Sometimes, this makes people feel as if their heart is beating fast or hard. Rarely, a heart rhythm problem can cause sudden death, which is when the heart suddenly stops beating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transient ischemic attack (called a &quot;TIA&quot;), which is similar to a stroke, but the brain isn't damaged</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667903926\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for mitral valve prolapse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The test used most often to check for mitral valve prolapse is an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;). This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It shows the size of the heart chambers, how well the heart is pumping, and how well the heart valves are working (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667903958\"><span class=\"h1\">How is mitral valve prolapse treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on how severe the mitral valve prolapse is and whether it is causing problems.</p><p>People with mild mitral valve prolapse and mild mitral regurgitation might not need any treatment. But their doctor will follow their condition to see if it worsens and needs treatment later on.</p><p>People with severe mitral regurgitation might need surgery. During surgery, the doctor will fix or replace the mitral valve. Some people who can't have surgery can instead have a procedure to reduce the leak. During this procedure, a doctor inserts tube called a catheter into a blood vessel in the arm or leg. Then the doctor advances the catheter up to the heart and attaches a clip to the valve leaflets.</p><p>Other treatments some people with mitral valve prolapse might have include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that lower blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that treat heart rhythm problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that help prevent blood clots &ndash; These medicines might be used if people also have a heart rhythm problem called &quot;atrial fibrillation.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667903973\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to take antibiotics before I go to the dentist?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. In the past, doctors recommended that people with mitral valve prolapse take antibiotics before going to the dentist or having certain medical or dental procedures. But now, only people with certain heart conditions need antibiotics before going to the dentist or having a procedure. People with mitral valve prolapse do <strong>not</strong> need antibiotics for those times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667903988\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor before you start trying. He or she will discuss the problems that might happen during your pregnancy. He or she might also need to change your medicines to ones that are safer to take during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667904003\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sudden cardiac arrest (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-valves-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prosthetic valves (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-regurgitation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mitral regurgitation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-ischemic-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Transient ischemic attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endocarditis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Endocarditis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-regurgitation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Mitral regurgitation (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotics-before-procedures-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Antibiotics before procedures (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-ischemic-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Transient ischemic attack (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
