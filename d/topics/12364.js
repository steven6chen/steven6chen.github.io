The predominant structural changes include mesangial expansion, glomerular basement membrane thickening, podocyte injury, and, ultimately, glomerular sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.) </p><p>The major clinical manifestations of diabetic nephropathy are albuminuria, hematuria (less often), and, in many patients, progressive chronic kidney disease, which can be slowed with optimal therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95228671\"><span class=\"h2\">Albuminuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional characteristics include hyperfiltration in very early disease (primarily in type 1 diabetes); moderately increased albuminuria, formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot; (defined as urinary albumin excretion between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine on a random urine sample); and severely increased albuminuria, formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot; (defined as urinary albumin excretion above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine on a random urine sample). Moderately increased albuminuria precedes the development of severely increased albuminuria and is considered to be a finding that predicts high risk for future nephropathy. The onset of severely increased albuminuria is, in the absence of effective therapy, often followed by a slowly progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and, given enough time, end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Issues related to moderately increased albuminuria in patients with diabetes are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119609355\"><span class=\"h3\">Progressive disease with normal or high-normal albuminuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For reasons that are not understood, the degree of albuminuria is not necessarily linked to disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy associated with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. This was illustrated in a report of 79 patients with type 1 diabetes from the Joslin Kidney Study who were followed for a mean of 12 years after the onset of moderately increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Twenty-three of the patients progressed to advanced disease (GFR less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. Among these patients, 11 had either stable moderately increased albuminuria or regression to normal albuminuria. The other 12 patients developed proteinuria that usually accompanied but did <strong>not</strong> precede the decline in GFR. The rate of loss of GFR was lower in patients with regression to normal albuminuria compared with patients with stable moderately increased albuminuria or progression to severely increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients who progressed to severely increased albuminuria had the highest rate of loss of GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and all six patients who developed end-stage renal disease had progressed to severely increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The factor(s) responsible for progressive GFR decline in nonalbuminuric diabetic nephropathy are not known. One possibility is intrarenal vascular disease. However, in a study of patients with type 2 diabetes and a GFR below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> intrarenal vascular resistance on renal duplex scan was elevated to a similar degree in patients with and without proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, nonalbuminuric progression occurs in type 1 diabetes, a population that is generally much younger than those with type 2 diabetes and less likely to have intrarenal vascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95228685\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine sediment in diabetic nephropathy is usually bland, but microscopic hematuria can occur as it can in any form of glomerular disease, including disorders such as membranous nephropathy that are not associated with glomerulonephritis. This is an important issue in diabetic nephropathy since nondiabetic renal disease, either alone or with diabetic nephropathy, is occasionally seen in patients with diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Nondiabetic renal disease'</a> below.) </p><p>The prevalence of hematuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy and whether it is due to diabetic nephropathy or a concurrent renal disease has been evaluated in a few studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In a report from Japan of 154 patients with diabetes mellitus, glomerular hematuria was observed in 26 (17 percent), 10 of whom had IgA nephropathy and one of whom had membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The remaining 15 patients with hematuria, compared with the 128 patients without hematuria, had more severe diabetic nephropathy on renal biopsy, as manifested by advanced diffuse glomerular lesions and by interstitial lesions, and by a significantly higher serum creatinine concentration.</p><p>Red blood cell casts have also been described in patients with diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The clinical significance of this finding was evaluated in a study of eight patients with hematuria, red blood cell casts, and known diabetes for 6 to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Renal biopsy, including immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, revealed glomerulonephritis in three (postinfectious in two and IgA nephropathy in one). The other five patients had only diabetic nephropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of diabetic nephropathy has been best studied in patients with type 1 disease since the time of clinical onset is usually known. Approximately 20 to 30 percent will have moderately increased albuminuria, formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria,&quot; after a mean duration of diabetes of 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Less than half of these patients will progress to overt nephropathy; moderately increased albuminuria may regress or remain stable in a substantial proportion, probably related to glycemic and blood pressure control with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Prevalence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Regression to normoalbuminuria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Before it was commonplace for patients with type 1 diabetes to be managed with intensive glycemic control and with angiotensin inhibition for blood pressure control, the incidence of developing overt nephropathy (eg, a persistently positive urine dipstick for protein, or urine albumin excretion &gt;300 mg per day) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/12,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-20</a>]. As examples, the incidence of overt nephropathy was 25 to 45 percent, and the incidence of ESRD was 4 to 17 percent at 20 years and 16 percent at 30 years of being diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, after so-called severely increased albuminuria developed (&gt;300 mg albuminuria per day, formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria,&quot; also called overt nephropathy or clinical grade proteinuria), the majority of patients progressed to ESRD.</p><p>However, with intensive glycemic control and the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs to control blood pressure, patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes may now have lower rates of overt nephropathy and ESRD. The following illustrates the range of findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/17,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from Sweden noted a dramatic reduction in clinically evident diabetic nephropathy to 8.9 percent at 25 years, a presumed reflection of better glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The average hemoglobin A1c concentration in the later part of this follow-up period was 7.0 percent; patients without overt proteinuria had a lower hemoglobin A1c concentration than those with proteinuria (7.1 versus 8.1 percent). A similar decline in incidence was not noted in another report in which this degree of glycemic control was not achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study from Finland evaluated the long-term outcomes of 20,005 patients over the period of 1965 to 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. During the median follow-up period of 17 years (maximum of 37 years), progression to ESRD occurred in only 632 patients, with the cumulative incidence being 2.2 and 7.8 percent at 20 and 30 years, respectively. In addition, the rate of ESRD was relatively lower among patient cohorts diagnosed at later time points, and the incidence of ESRD was lowest among those diagnosed prior to the age of 5 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/EDIC</span> type 1 diabetes cohort, less than 2 percent (10 of 711) of the intensively treated subjects developed renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or renal replacement therapy) over an average of 30 years of diabetes duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p>In addition, severely increased albuminuria (urine albumin excretion &gt;300 mg per day) no longer heralds an inexorable progression to ESRD. Rather, albuminuria may regress in many if not most of these patients, and rates of ESRD may be less than 20 percent at 10 years. In the <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/EDIC</span> type 1 diabetes cohort, for example, 123 patients developed severely increased albuminuria that was persistent at two consecutive study visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. During the subsequent 10 years, 58 percent of these patients regressed to &lt;300 mg of albuminuria per day, and 12 percent regressed to &lt;30 mg per day. The 10-year rates of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and ESRD in the subjects with severely increased albuminuria were 34 and 18 percent, respectively. Lower HbA1c and blood pressure values were associated with a greater frequency of albuminuria regression and a lower incidence of reduced eGFR and ESRD. Thus, even patients who develop overt nephropathy can avoid progressive renal impairment with modern therapies. </p><p>The onset of overt nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is typically between 10 and 15 years after the onset of the disease. Those patients who have no proteinuria after 20 to 25 years have a risk of developing overt renal disease of only about 1 percent per year, at least among Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>]. Thus, an alternative cause of renal disease should be considered in a diabetic patient who develops new proteinuric kidney disease more than 20 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Caucasians, the prevalence of progressive renal disease has generally been lower in type 2 diabetes than in type 1 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, this observation may be a function of the usually later-onset disease and shorter-duration &quot;exposure&quot; in type 2 than type 1 diabetes, and may not apply to all groups with type 2 diabetes, some of whom have had a more ominous renal prognosis. In a 1990s study, for example, nephropathy developed in up to 50 percent of diabetic Pima Indians at 20 years, with 15 percent having progressed to ESRD by this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As previously described, however, the use of modern therapies lowers the incidence of ESRD, even in groups at extremely high risk such as the Pima Indians. In a subsequent study, for example, the incidence of diabetic ESRD was noted to have declined significantly from the period 1991-1994 to the period 1999-2002 (32 to 15 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Data suggest that the renal risk is currently equivalent in the two types of diabetes. Evidence in support of this hypothesis includes the observations in one report that the time to proteinuria from the onset of diabetes and the time to ESRD from the onset of proteinuria were similar in type 1 and type 2 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Some of the most robust data relating to the development of diabetic nephropathy in a population of predominantly white patients with type 2 was reported from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The UKPDS was designed to compare the efficacy of different treatment regimens (diet, oral hypoglycemics, insulin, antihypertensive agents, varying blood pressure goals, and other interventions) on glycemic control and the complications of diabetes (including renal failure) in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes. The details of this study are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With respect to the development and progression of nephropathy among almost 5100 type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in UKPDS, the following results were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 10 years following diagnosis, the prevalence of moderately increased albuminuria, severely increased albuminuria, and either an elevated plasma creatinine concentration (defined as &ge;175 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> [2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL])</span> or requirement for renal replacement therapy was 25, 5, and 0.8 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The yearly rate of progression from diagnosis to moderately increased albuminuria, from moderately increased albuminuria to severely increased albuminuria, and from severely increased albuminuria to an elevated plasma creatinine concentration or renal replacement therapy was 2.0, 2.8, and 2.3 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon a statistical model, an estimation of the median time spent in each stage without progression to another nephropathy stage was 19, 11, and 10 years for those with no nephropathy, moderately increased albuminuria, and severely increased albuminuria, respectively.

The likelihood of developing diabetic nephropathy is markedly increased in patients with a diabetic sibling or parent who has diabetic nephropathy; these observations have been made in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. One report, for example, evaluated Pima Indian families in which two successive generations had type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The likelihood of the offspring developing overt proteinuria was 14 percent if neither parent had proteinuria, 23 percent if one parent had proteinuria, and 46 percent if both parents had proteinuria. The familial increase in risk cannot be explained by the duration of diabetes, hypertension, or the degree of glycemic control, and the genetic basis underlying the heritability of diabetic nephropathy is largely unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p>Although previous studies have implicated an array of genetic variants as potentially impacting the risk of nephropathy among diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/87,91-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,91-99</a>], the largest and most extensive analysis failed to identify any single variant that met stringent definitions of association and, in addition, did not confirm previously published variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. However, this study, which included 12,540 patients with type 1 diabetes, found that alleles that increase the risk of obesity and those that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes elevate the risk of kidney disease, suggesting that obesity and insulin resistance are risk factors for diabetic nephropathy.

By contrast, in a population-based study of 1856 Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes, patients who developed diabetes prior to age 20 had a higher risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (25 versus 5 per 1000 patient years at risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>For type 1 diabetes, the risk of developing ESRD is very low for patients diagnosed prior to age 5; at older ages, the relationship of age to progression to ESRD is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/22,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective studies have noted an association between the subsequent development of diabetic nephropathy and higher systemic pressures.

The association between these hemodynamic and structural changes and the development of diabetic nephropathy may be related both to intraglomerular hypertension (which drives the hyperfiltration) and to glomerular hypertrophy (which also increases wall stress).

Studies in experimental animals suggest that the diabetic state is associated with impaired renal autoregulation.

In one study of 35 patients with diabetes and significant proteinuria (&gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> 27 (77 percent) were found to have diabetic nephropathy by biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Diabetic retinopathy was present in 15 of the 27 (56 percent), and in none of the eight individuals without diabetic nephropathy, thereby resulting in a positive and negative predictive value of 100 and 40 percent, respectively. Further analysis of some of these patients plus additional type 2 diabetics with proteinuria found that, among those without retinopathy, approximately 30 percent did not have diabetic nephropathy upon renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p>Thus, type 2 diabetics with marked proteinuria and retinopathy most likely have diabetic nephropathy, while those without retinopathy have a high frequency of nondiabetic glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggest that 30 percent of type 2 diabetics with renal insufficiency have nondiabetic renal disease, as inferred by the absence of albuminuria and retinopathy in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>].</p><p>Some insight into the correlation between nephropathy and retinopathy was provided by a study in which 36 patients with type 2 diabetes and renal involvement underwent renal biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Seventeen biopsies displayed diabetic glomerulosclerosis with Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, while 15 revealed changes characteristic of diabetes (mesangial sclerosis) but without classic nodules. Patients with and without nodules did not differ with respect to duration of diabetes or degree of glycemic control. A close correlation was observed between the presence of severe retinopathy and nodules on biopsy: six of seven patients with proliferative retinopathy had such nodules, while seven of eight without retinopathy had mesangial sclerosis. Overall, severe retinopathy was more closely associated with nodules than with mesangial sclerosis. The reason for this association is unknown.</p><p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system slows the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy and may have a similar benefit in diabetic retinopathy. In a randomized trial of 285 patients with type 1 diabetes, normal blood pressure, and normoalbuminuria, therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> reduced the odds of retinopathy progression by 65 to 70 percent, compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based upon the correlation between retinopathy and nephropathy, the 2007 <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI</span> Guidelines for diabetes and chronic kidney disease suggest that chronic kidney disease should be attributed to diabetes in most patients with diabetes if moderately increased albuminuria, formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria,&quot; or proteinuria and diabetic retinopathy are both present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. By comparison, other causes of CKD should be entertained if diabetic retinopathy is absent.

As examples, membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, IgA nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), thin basement membrane disease, proliferative glomerulonephritis, collapsing glomerulopathy, and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis have all been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/9,10,107,125,126,132-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,107,125,126,132-145</a>]. Since renal disease in the setting of diabetes is often ascribed to the diabetes, without further diagnostic efforts, the coincidence of nondiabetic renal disease in persons with diabetes may be underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>].</p><p>With respect to membranous nephropathy, porcine insulin may be the inciting antigen in some patients. This was suggested in a report of seven patients with diabetes who developed membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Three of the patients had granular deposits of insulin along the glomerular capillary wall, as detected by anti-porcine insulin antibodies, along with IgG and complement. The nephrotic syndrome developed after the initiation of porcine insulin in all three patients and, in two of these patients, the use of human insulin rather than porcine insulin led to amelioration of the proteinuria. The other four patients had idiopathic membranous nephropathy.

These disorders typically have a relatively rapid onset in contrast to the slow progression over years from moderately increased albuminuria, formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria,&quot; to severely increased albuminuria, formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria,&quot; in diabetic nephropathy.

This disorder cannot usually be distinguished from diabetic nephropathy without performing a renal biopsy; this is rarely necessary since making this distinction is of no clinical value. One potential clue favoring the presence of nephrosclerosis is a rise in the plasma creatinine concentration, due to interference with renal autoregulation, after institution of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to treat hypertension or to slow the rate of progression of the renal disease. However, this is also consistent with renal artery stenosis.
