It can present as an acute, life-threatening emergency or a chronic, subclinical process, depending on the degree and tempo of the process and the contribution of morbidities from the underlying cause. Identifying DIC and the underlying condition responsible for it are critical to proper management.</p><p>This topic discusses the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of DIC in adults. DIC in children and during pregnancy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated intravascular coagulation during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Separate topic reviews also discuss general approaches to evaluating patients with abnormal bleeding and unexplained microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.

There are multiple feedbacks built into this system to prevent activation of coagulation in the absence of vessel injury and restrict the clot to the site of injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In DIC, the processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis become abnormally (and often massively) activated within the vasculature, leading to ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis.</p><p>A typical sequence of events includes the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F98047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98047 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Procoagulant exposure</strong> &ndash; Blood is exposed to one or more procoagulants, such as tissue factor (TF), from which it is normally protected. Sources and components of these procoagulants depend on the underlying condition. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharides, can activate coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In meningococcal sepsis, microparticles containing TF are found in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Cancer procoagulant&quot; is a proteolytic enzyme produced by some mucinous tumors and placenta that is capable of activating factor X [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In trauma, damage to the vascular endothelium and tissues may cause release of procoagulant enzymes or phospholipids.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In severe intravascular hemolysis, such as an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) caused by ABO mismatch, coagulation is activated by a combination of processes including TF release (likely by monocytes), generation of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1), and reduced nitric oxide (NO) function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with inherited or acquired protein C deficiency, an imbalance between thrombin generation and fibrinolysis may be responsible for overwhelming normal mechanisms that protect against inappropriate coagulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neutrophils may contribute to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which have procoagulant properties. (See <a href=\"#H2877027455\" class=\"local\">'Role of extracellular cell-free DNA and DNA-binding proteins'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulation</strong> &ndash; Activation of the coagulation cascade leads to the production of thrombi consisting of fibrin and platelets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 2</a>). These can occur in the microvasculature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger vessels. Extensive formation of thrombi in turn leads to consumption of endogenous coagulation factors, producing a &quot;consumption coagulopathy&quot;; and of platelets and anticoagulant factors (eg, protein S, protein C, antithrombin).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibrinolysis</strong> &ndash; Fibrinolysis is activated at sites of thrombus formation, with generation of fibrin degradation products (FDP) that, when present in significant amounts, interfere with both fibrin clot formation and platelet aggregation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders due to abnormal fibrinolysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>End organ damage</strong> &ndash; Tissue or organ damage may result from reduced perfusion, thrombosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding. Often, contributions from DIC itself and the condition that precipitated it are intertwined. Organ failure may result in significant morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Organ dysfunction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19390989\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Other vascular factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of DIC include endothelial damage, which can result in the release of procoagulant substances and the loss of endothelial antithrombotic properties; reduced local blood flow, which slows diffusion of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors away from the site; and reduced organ perfusion, which may delay hepatic clearance of coagulation byproducts. Levels of nitric oxide may be reduced, causing increased vascular tone and enhanced platelet aggregation and activation.</p><p>Other blood cells may also participate. As an example, monocytes are known to secrete TF and von Willebrand factor (VWF) when stimulated by pathogens.</p><p>Acidosis and hypothermia may also interfere with appropriate coagulation in the setting of trauma, resuscitation, or sepsis because the enzymatic functions of the coagulation factors are pH and temperature-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2877027455\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of extracellular cell-free DNA and DNA-binding proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing evidence suggests that damage-associated pattern molecules (DAMPs, also called &quot;alarmins&quot;) including cell-free DNA (cfDNA), extracellular histones, and DNA-binding proteins play a critical role in the pathogenesis of DIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. DAMPs are released from dying cells or secreted from immune cells in response to infection or tissue injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H4039368\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Interaction of innate and adaptive immunity'</a>.)</p><p>Elevated levels of circulating extracellular cfDNA, normally found at approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> in healthy people, are found in various pathologic conditions including sepsis, trauma, cancer, and autoimmune diseases, and provide evidence of extensive formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are web-like structures composed of decondensed chromatin coated with a variety of cellular proteins such as myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, histones, and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) that are released from dead or dying neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>NET formation (NETosis) is a complex and incompletely characterized process in which nuclear chromatin becomes decondensed and released into the cytoplasm, followed by rupture of the plasma membrane and expulsion of the cellular contents into the extracellular space. NETosis accompanies a form of lytic cell death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis. Under normal conditions, NETosis appears to be a highly regulated component of innate immunity that is protective against microbial pathogens, but it becomes dysregulated in severe inflammatory conditions. The cfDNA and other nuclear proteins released during NETosis are cytotoxic and play an important role in the pathogenesis of DIC.</p><p>NETosis is highly procoagulant. It activates the clotting cascade and influences primary and secondary hemostasis via a number of mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery of tissue factor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of the contact phase of coagulation by cfDNA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxicity of cfDNA, which activates cell surface Toll-like receptor (TLR9)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of platelet aggregation by cfDNA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteolytic degradation of anticoagulants such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) via neutrophil elastase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxicity to endothelial cells from DNA binding proteins that are normally excluded from the circulation, such as histones and HMGB1</p><p/><p>NET formation has been shown to play an important role in the development and propagation of pathological venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. An antibody directed at histone proteins has been shown to reduce sepsis-related mortality in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In a 2015 study involving 199 patients with DIC and 20 healthy controls, elevated plasma levels of DNA-histone complexes and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), considered to be in vivo markers of NETosis, correlated with the severity of coagulopathy in DIC and were independent prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1131203093\"><span class=\"h2\">Compensatory changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DIC is a dynamic process. The acuity and magnitude of ongoing intravascular coagulation determine whether consumption of coagulation factors and platelets can be compensated adequately by ongoing synthesis of coagulation factors and generation of new platelets in the bone marrow. The two ends of the spectrum between inadequate and adequate compensation are sometimes referred to as acute and chronic DIC.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute DIC</strong> &ndash; Acute (decompensated) DIC can develop when blood is exposed to large amounts of tissue factor (or other procoagulant substances) over a brief period of time, with significant generation of thrombin. This leads to rapid consumption of coagulation factors that outpaces their production. The fibrin degradation products (FDPs) that are generated in turn disrupt normal fibrin polymerization and fibrinogen binding to platelet surface &alpha;IIb&beta;3 (GPIIbIIIa), thus interfering with both fibrin clot formation and platelet aggregation, and effectively operating as pathological anticoagulant and anti-platelet agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The consumption coagulopathy, combined with the high concentration of FDPs, leads to the severe bleeding diathesis seen in decompensated DIC, and accounts for the clinical observation that supportive therapy with Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusions by themselves are generally insufficient to completely correct the bleeding diathesis. Clotting times become prolonged and the potential for clinically important bleeding increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Acute DIC is typically seen in settings such as sepsis, trauma, or acute promyelocytic leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H87005289\" class=\"local\">'Acute DIC'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic DIC</strong> &ndash; Chronic (compensated) DIC can develop when blood is continuously or intermittently exposed to smaller amounts of tissue factor (or other procoagulant substances). Coagulation factors and platelets are consumed, but production is able to compensate, and the liver is able to clear the FDPs. Clotting times may be normal, and thrombocytopenia may be mild or absent. Thrombosis generally predominates over bleeding, although many patients are asymptomatic with laboratory-only evidence of increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Chronic DIC is typically seen in patients with advanced malignancy, especially pancreatic, gastric, ovarian, and brain tumors. (See <a href=\"#H87005698\" class=\"local\">'Chronic DIC'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-the-hypercoagulable-state-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of the hypercoagulable state associated with malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13563746\"><span class=\"h2\">DIC versus other TMAs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DIC is associated with microvascular thrombi that contain fibrin as well as platelets.</p><p>In contrast, some of the other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), are characterized by platelet-rich microthrombi without significant fibrin clot formation or consumption coagulopathy. Thus, other TMAs generally present with thrombocytopenia and normal coagulation studies.</p><p>In some cases, other TMAs are caused by clearly defined endothelial defects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTP is caused by deficiency of the ADAMTS13 protease, which results in accumulation of very long von Willebrand factor multimers on the endothelial surface that are capable of binding platelets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of acquired TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)&quot;, section on 'TTP pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement-mediated HUS is thought to be caused by complement-induced damage to the endothelium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>These endothelial defects may promote platelet adherence and activation without exposing the blood to large amounts of procoagulant substances.</p><p>Both DIC and other TMAs can produce microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), characterized by schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 \">picture 1</a>). Schistocytes are formed as red blood cells (RBCs) pass through fibrin strands and microthrombi and become mechanically sheared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81610\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81610 \">picture 2</a>).

Most individuals with DIC have an obvious underlying condition associated with DIC such as sepsis or malignancy, but occasionally DIC is the presenting finding for these conditions.</p><p>DIC is a clinical <strong>and</strong> laboratory diagnosis, based on findings of coagulopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrinolysis in the appropriate setting (eg, sepsis, malignancy). No single laboratory test can accurately confirm or eliminate the diagnosis.</p><p>Findings such as thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer are considered to be relatively sensitive for the diagnosis but not specific; however data from clinical trials addressing sensitivity and specificity are lacking. Some of the other causes of these findings are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients for whom an underlying condition known to be associated with DIC is obvious, the laboratory evaluation typically includes a complete blood count, review of the peripheral blood smear, and screening tests of coagulation (eg, prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen, and D-dimer). For patients without bleeding or thrombosis, the PT and aPTT may be done first, and fibrinogen and D-dimer done only in those with prolonged PT and aPTT. For patients with bleeding or thrombosis, it is appropriate to obtain all of these tests simultaneously. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis has developed a scoring system to be applied to individuals with an underlying disorder associated with DIC, which incorporates laboratory features including the PT, platelet count, fibrinogen level, and D-dimer; this scoring system has been validated but is not widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Testing is often repeated serially to determine if coagulation and fibrinolysis are worsening or improving. The frequency of testing depends on the severity of clinical findings. Daily or even twice-daily testing may be appropriate in an acutely ill patient with active bleeding or thrombosis; less frequent testing may be reasonable in a patient with laboratory-only findings.</p><p>For patients with findings suggestive of DIC who do not have an obvious underlying cause, the evaluation for DIC is conducted simultaneously with the evaluation for the underlying condition responsible for ongoing coagulation, as well as the evaluation for other possible causes of bleeding, thrombosis, and laboratory abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H255175\" class=\"local\">'Causes of DIC'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>We consider the diagnosis of acute DIC to be established if the patient has laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia, coagulation factor consumption (eg, prolonged PT, aPTT; low fibrinogen), and fibrinolysis (eg, increased D-dimer), as long as another etiology for these findings does not become apparent. Bleeding or thrombosis are supportive of the diagnosis if present but are not required for diagnosis.</p><p>We consider the diagnosis of chronic DIC confirmed if the patient has evidence of fibrinolysis (eg, increased D-dimer) in the absence of another etiology, such as VTE, in an appropriate clinical setting. Typically, this implies the presence of malignancy, although certain other causes, such as a vascular lesion, may be present. Chronic DIC in a patient with malignancy does not necessarily imply the need for a clinical intervention; management is guided by the clinical setting and treatment goals for the individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H255175\" class=\"local\">'Causes of DIC'</a> above.)</p><p>Of note, we do <strong>not</strong> test for chronic DIC routinely in patients with malignancy. We reserve this testing for patients with evidence of unexpected bleeding or thromboembolic complications, and prior to initiating anticoagulant therapy. We also do not test for chronic DIC preoperatively in a patient with cancer if the PT, aPTT, and platelet count are normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of DIC includes other conditions associated with bleeding and hypercoagulability, and other causes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia. Some conditions, such as liver failure, can be either a cause of DIC or a consequence of DIC. In such cases, the diagnosis of the other condition does not eliminate the possibility of DIC, and vice versa.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe liver disease</strong> &ndash; Liver disease severe enough to impair the hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors can cause a severe coagulopathy. Like DIC, severe liver disease is associated with reductions in both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors as well as thrombocytopenia; patients can have bleeding or thrombosis. The coagulation factor reductions and thrombocytopenia in severe liver disease are often caused by a combination of hypersplenism and thrombopoietin (TPO) deficiency, since the liver is the primary site of TPO synthesis. Unlike DIC, patients with severe liver disease typically present with a known source of liver injury (eg, acute hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis) and abnormal liver function tests, although transaminases may appear to normalize if liver synthetic function is severely impaired. Some clinicians consider factor VIII levels to be helpful because factor VIII is not produced by hepatocytes and thus is often low in DIC and high in severe liver disease.

Like DIC, patients with HIT can have thrombosis (due to platelet activation by the HIT antibody <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the underlying condition for which they were receiving heparin) and bleeding (due to heparin or the non-heparin anticoagulant used to treat HIT). Unlike DIC, patients with HIT typically have recent heparin exposure and a positive laboratory testing for heparin-PF4 antibodies (HIT antibodies); and patients with HIT do not have global coagulation abnormalities, with the exception of abnormalities caused by their anticoagulant or increased D-dimer associated with thromboembolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)</strong> &ndash; TTP and other TMAs (eg, drug-induced TMA [DITMA], hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS]) present with MAHA and thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption in microvascular thrombi. Like DIC, patients may be acutely ill, thrombocytopenic, and have schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Unlike DIC, patients with TTP, DITMA, or HUS have normal coagulation testing because microvascular thrombi in these conditions are primarily platelet-rich and fibrin-poor thrombi, and are not associated with consumption coagulopathy (ie, the PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer are normal in TTP and other TMAs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78455 \">table 3</a>). A rare exception may be a patient with a TMA that leads to organ ischemia and in turn causes DIC. Also, unlike DIC, patients with TTP and other TMAs tend to have more severe microangiopathic changes on the blood smear, and other laboratory abnormalities specific to the type of TMA (eg, ADAMTS13 activity level &lt;10 percent in TTP; complement abnormalities in complement-mediated HUS, positive stool studies in Shiga toxin-mediated HUS).
