It involves a gland in the neck called the thyroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>). This gland makes thyroid hormone, which controls how the body uses and stores energy.</p><p>Hyperthyroidism is the term doctors use when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344624\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have hyperthyroidism and want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have hyperthyroidism and want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse before you start trying.</p><p>Your doctor will treat your hyperthyroidism before you start trying to get pregnant. In general, hyperthyroidism in a person who is not pregnant can be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioactive iodine &ndash; This comes in a pill or liquid you swallow. It contains a small amount of radiation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid gland</p><p/><p>You and your doctor will figure out which treatment is best for you. The decision depends on many factors.</p><p>It's best to treat your hyperthyroidism before you try to get pregnant. If your hyperthyroidism is treated, you won't have to take medicines for it during pregnancy.</p><p>Women who are treated with radioactive iodine or surgery need to wait at least 6 months before trying to get pregnant. That way, their doctor will have enough time to check whether they are making enough thyroid hormone. Many people treated with radioactive iodine or surgery end up making too little thyroid hormone after treatment.</p><p>This is a problem because women with too little thyroid hormone can have trouble getting pregnant. Also, if a woman has too little thyroid hormone, it can affect her baby's development early in pregnancy. Women who don't make enough thyroid hormone will need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344639\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I develop hyperthyroidism during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you develop hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, your doctor will want to know what's causing it. The 2 most common causes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called Graves' disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58509\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58509 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism &ndash; This is caused by a pregnancy hormone called hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin).</p><p/><p>To figure out the cause, your doctor will do different blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344677\"><span class=\"h1\">How might hyperthyroidism affect a pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild hyperthyroidism does not usually cause any problems for a woman or her baby. But severe hyperthyroidism can lead to problems if it isn't treated. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems in the mother, such as heart problems or a condition called preeclampsia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the pregnancy, such as preterm labor (when labor starts too early) or miscarriage (when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344692\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hyperthyroidism that develops during pregnancy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what's causing the hyperthyroidism and how serious it is.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism does not usually need treatment. This condition usually goes away on its own later on during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild hyperthyroidism from Graves' disease also does not usually need treatment. But your doctor will monitor your thyroid hormone levels by doing blood tests on a regular basis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe hyperthyroidism from Graves' disease does need treatment. This usually involves medicines called thionamides. Your doctor will prescribe different ones at different times during your pregnancy. That's because some are more likely to cause birth defects at certain times during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344707\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. During pregnancy, you will have blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels on a regular basis.</p><p>Women with Graves' disease will also have tests to check whether their unborn baby has hyperthyroidism. Even though it is rare, unborn babies sometimes get hyperthyroidism. These tests usually include blood tests and an ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of your baby. If your unborn baby has hyperthyroidism, the doctor can treat it by giving you medicine.</p><p>After pregnancy, women with Graves' disease will have blood tests to check their thyroid hormone levels every so often. That&rsquo;s because the condition can come back later on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344722\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I have a normal vaginal delivery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most women can have a normal vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344737\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I breastfeed my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most women are able to breastfeed. But be sure to talk with your doctor so he or she can make sure your medicines are safe to take when breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344752\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chances are good that your baby will be healthy. In rare cases, though, babies born to women with Graves' disease can also have hyperthyroidism. To check for this condition, babies have blood tests done after birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600344767\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Miscarriage (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Miscarriage (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
