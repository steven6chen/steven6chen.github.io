Originally described in 1966, it remains a somewhat controversial disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HE is most often characterized by a subacute onset of confusion with altered level of consciousness, seizures, and myoclonus. In contrast to the cognitive dysfunction associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, HE is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder rather than representing the direct effect of an altered thyroid state on the central nervous system.</p><p>Although there is some debate regarding the appropriateness of the term Hashimoto encephalopathy, it remains the most widely used term to describe this syndrome. Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) and a more general term, nonvasculitic autoimmune meningoencephalitis, are also used to describe this condition.</p><p>Hashimoto encephalopathy will be reviewed here. Hashimoto thyroiditis and other neurologic complications of thyroid disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myxedema-coma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myxedema coma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) is unknown. It does not appear to be directly related to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, as the majority of reported patients are euthyroid at the time of presentation. A toxic effect of increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone on the central nervous system has been proposed, as some patients appear to improve with thyroid supplementation despite being euthyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, these cases appear to be the exception rather than the rule.</p><p>The bulk of evidence points to an autoimmune vasculitis or other inflammatory process, perhaps associated with immune complex deposition, and possibly disrupting the cerebral microvasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic examination at autopsy or brain biopsy in a few patients has identified lymphocytic infiltration around small arterioles and venules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with HE appear to respond to corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disorder is more common in women, as is true of most autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated antithyroid antibodies, an essential feature of this disorder, are consistent with an active autoimmune process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series, seven of eight patients had HLA B8 DRw3 haplotypes compared with 30 percent of a control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This profile is common to other patients with autoimmune diseases.</p><p/><p>The nature of the relationship between Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and HE is unclear. Some argue that the association is entirely spurious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Elevated antithyroid antibodies in the serum correlate well with pathologic thyroiditis. However, elevated titers are prevalent in the general healthy population, occurring in 2 to 10 percent of young adults and 5 to 20 percent of older adults. It is possible, therefore, that elevated titers are a coincidental finding.</p><p>Others argue that the relationship between HT and HE is just that seen among autoimmune disorders in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. HT itself is associated with neurologic and systemic autoimmune diseases including myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Support for this argument includes the observation that the symptoms of HE are not paralleled by symptoms of thyroiditis. In addition, changes in antithyroid autoantibody levels do not consistently correspond with neurologic symptoms or improvement with treatment. These findings lead some to propose that steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) is a more appropriate designation for this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>The nature of the putative autoimmune response in HE is speculative. A number of observations and investigations in small numbers of patients have elicited different theories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HE may result from a direct antibody-mediated neuronal injury. Immunohistochemical analysis in one patient with HE detected an anti-neuronal antibody that reacted with human cerebral cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HE may represent a vasculitis that results from either endothelial inflammation or immune complex deposition. Findings of perfusion deficits on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) suggest vascular involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A potentially specific marker for HE has been identified in an autoantibody expressed against the amino terminal end of the enzyme alpha enolase. In one study, reactivity was found in five of six HE patients compared with 2 of 17 patients with HT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. No reactivity was found either in 25 healthy controls or in 25 patients with other autoimmune or encephalopathic neurologic disorders. A pathogenic role for this antibody is not understood; however, as alpha enolase is expressed on endothelial cells it may mediate a vasculitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HE may be a primary demyelinating process akin to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). This is corroborated by pathologic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a few patients with HE, which appear similar to those seen in ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. However, MRI findings of white matter disease are not typical of most reported patients with HE. These ADEM-like cases may represent anomalous cases of acute demyelinating disease in patients with incidentally elevated antithyroid antibody levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HE may represent an immune complex disease, since immune complexes were found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a series of six patients with HE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, CSF IgG indices are inconsistently elevated in HE. Also, the degree of inflammation on CSF analysis and neuroimaging appears mild in HE and therefore at odds with this pathogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It seems unlikely that the antithyroid antibodies play a pathogenic role in HE. There is no evidence of a central nervous system antigen recognized by these antibodies. On the other hand, antithyroid antibodies were identified in the CSF of all six of the patients with HE in one report and in none of the controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This, in the absence of blood brain barrier disruption, suggests possible intrathecal synthesis of these antibodies. However, others have not found these antibodies to be reliably present in the CSF in patients with HE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATED DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonvasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less frequently reported than Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) are similar syndromes in other autoimmune disorders (eg, Sjogren's syndrome) that have been labeled nonvasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis (NAIM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. HE and NAIM are clinically similar and have similar diagnostic findings, suggesting that HE may be a subset of NAIM. A lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is not, as one might expect from its name, a cardinal feature of NAIM and is also relatively uncommon among reported cases of HE. A steroid-responsive encephalopathy has been reported in one patient with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an inflammatory, presumably autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some propose that HE is a form of ADEM. One series identified a high rate of possible provoking factors for HE, such as infection and surgery, which are also noted in ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although a few reported cases of HE have similar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathologic findings to ADEM, most do not. It seems possible that these exceptional cases are in fact cases of ADEM with incidental elevations of antithyroid antibodies. Unlike HE, ADEM is a monophasic disorder and is not generally associated with other autoimmune diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review published in 2006 identified only 121 published cases of Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the syndrome may be underrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A hospital-based epidemiologic study aggressively screened for HE in patients with unexplained neurologic symptoms consistent with HE and estimated the prevalence of HE to be 2.1 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Among reported cases, the mean age of onset of initial symptoms is 41 to 44 years (range 9 to 78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2-4,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,21,23</a>]. Women are more commonly affected than men, at a ratio of approximately four to one.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) most often include an acute to subacute onset of confusion with alteration of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Two patterns of presentation have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stroke-like pattern of multiple, recurrent, acute to subacute episodes of focal neurologic deficits with a variable degree of cognitive dysfunction and alteration of consciousness. Approximately 25 percent of patients follow this course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diffuse, progressive pattern, characterized by slowly progressive cognitive impairment with dementia, confusion, hallucinations, or somnolence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>]. Some cases have a more fulminant presentation in which rapid deterioration to coma occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].</p><p/><p>These clinical patterns can overlap. In addition to confusion and mental status changes, other neurologic signs are common in both groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately two-thirds of patients experience focal or generalized tonic-clonic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,25,26</a>]. Status epilepticus has been reported in 12 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myoclonus or tremor is seen in up to 38 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>]. Myoclonus may be focal or multifocal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse hyperreflexia and other pyramidal tract signs are present in 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosis, particularly visual hallucinations, but also paranoid delusions, have been reported in 25 to 36 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>].</p><p/><p>The long-term course of illness may be self-limited, relapsing-remitting, or progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Rare syndromes associated with HE include a cerebellopathy with or without encephalopathy, isolated myelopathy, and chorea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/23,29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29-33</a>]. Peripheral nervous system involvement with electrophysiological evidence of a sensory ganglionopathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> amyotrophy has been described in individual cases of HE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>There are no systemic symptoms, including fever, with rare exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Neurologic symptoms can occur in patients with a known diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) or in patients without a previous diagnosis. The development of clinical HT may occur up to three years after presentation with HE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithyroid antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated serum level of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) is an essential laboratory feature of Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE). However, there is no clear relationship between the severity of neurologic symptoms and the type or serum concentration of antibodies; in addition, antibody levels may or may not decrease following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,7,11,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,11,21,22</a>]. Given the prevalence of these antibodies in the general healthy population of 2 to 20 percent, this cannot be considered to be a specific finding for HE.</p><p>Antithyroid antibodies are infrequently measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). One case series found that 9 of 12 patients with encephalopathy and elevated serum antithyroid antibodies had elevated CSF autoantibody titres [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The authors suggested that serum antibody titers were overly sensitive. However, other investigators did not find antithyroid antibodies in the CSF of patients with HE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The specificity and sensitivity of anti-thyroid antibodies in the CSF are unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid hormone levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid status varies among patients with reported HE, ranging from overt hypothyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism. In systematic reviews, 23 to 35 percent of patients with HE have subclinical hypothyroidism and 17 to 20 percent have overt hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>].

These findings and a response to corticosteroids generally defines this syndrome. Thyroid hormone levels should be measured but, as noted above, thyroid status is variable in HE. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid hormone levels'</a> above.)</p><p>Essential testing to exclude other diagnoses includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture to include cultures for bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mycobacterium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electroencephalography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium administration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing for usual causes of delirium (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic tests'</a>)</p><p/><p>Because the treatment of HE consists of immunosuppressive therapy, it is especially important to thoroughly exclude infection. Other, less routine diagnostic test considerations should include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for 14-3-3 protein (for possible Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease), CSF cytology, antibody testing for possible paraneoplastic or autoimmune encephalopathy, and screening for underlying neoplasm.

Given the rarity of the disorder, an optimal steroid dose has not been defined. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses ranging from 50 mg to 150 mg daily have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. High-dose intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> has been administered in a few patients, but a benefit compared with oral corticosteroids is unknown.</p><p>Most patients (90 to 98 percent) respond to steroid therapy. Symptoms typically improve or resolve over a few months. The duration of treatment and the rate of taper are generally titrated to the clinical response. In some patients, this is as long as two years.</p><p>Several patients have been treated with other immunosuppressive medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/5,7,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,42</a>]. These are generally reserved for patients who cannot tolerate corticosteroids, or who do not respond to or relapse after or during tapering of corticosteroid therapy. Clinical improvement with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], and plasmapheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>] has been reported in individual cases.</p><p>Treatment of seizures with an anticonvulsant medication such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> may be necessary as a temporary measure. In some patients, seizures do not respond to antiseizure drugs but may respond to steroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) is generally but not universally good. While a delay to diagnosis and therefore treatment might be expected to be associated with less complete recovery, case series and reports suggest that patients can improve with treatment even after a few years of symptoms. However, residual cognitive impairment occurs in about 25 percent of patients with long-standing untreated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/7,38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,38,41</a>].</p><p>Spontaneous recovery can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/22,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,38</a>]. However, most reports of long-term follow-up are in treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Many of these patients remain disease-free after discontinuation of steroids over several years of follow-up. In one series of 20 patients, eight discontinued use of steroids after treatment and had no relapse, three relapsed and were treated with additional course of steroids, and nine required continuous treatment with steroids or other immunomodulatory therapy to maintain remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A lower rate of long-term immunosuppressive therapy use (3 of 18) was reported in another case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hashimoto-encephalopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) is a syndrome of acute or subacute encephalopathy that is associated with elevated anti-thyroid antibody titers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HE appears to be a rare syndrome, but may be underrecognized. As with Hashimoto thyroiditis, women are more commonly affected than men. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bulk of evidence suggests that HE is an autoimmune disorder and is not due to thyroid disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presentation is heterogeneous with a fulminant, subacute, or more chronic course of declining mental status that is frequently accompanied by seizures and myoclonus. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of elevated antithyroid antibody titres and the exclusion of other causes of encephalopathy support the diagnosis of HE. While the diagnosis is disputed, there appears to be enough evidence to support checking antithyroid antibody levels as a second- or third-tier diagnostic test in patients presenting with unexplained encephalopathy and considering the diagnosis of HE if levels are elevated.<br/><br/>Other test findings are nonspecific. Nonetheless, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and other laboratory studies are essential in these patients to exclude other causes of encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with encephalopathy and elevated antithyroid antibody levels in whom other causes of encephalopathy are rigorously excluded, we suggest an initial trial of corticosteroid therapy rather than other immunosuppressive therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other immunosuppressive treatments have also been used in patients who cannot take corticosteroids, who are refractory to corticosteroids or who relapse after initial treatment. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients have a good outcome, but a significant minority have persistent cognitive deficits, particularly those with long-standing untreated disease. Relapses may require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
