Manifestations of endoleak range from asymptomatic to uncontrolled aortic rupture. Endoleaks result from a poor seal at the proximal or distal fixation sites or between the graft components, from patent lumbar vessels, or from the result of graft material failure. </p><p>Endoleaks may be identified on completion arteriography at the time of endovascular graft placement or during later follow-up at the time of endograft surveillance imaging. The type of endoleak, classified as type I through type IV, determines its clinical significance and treatment. Some types of endoleak clearly affect short-term and long-term outcomes. There is little controversy that type I and III endoleaks should be treated, but there is debate about the clinical importance of type II endoleak. Reports conflict regarding the optimal timing and type of treatment. Most endoleaks are managed successfully with the placement of additional stents or by using embolization techniques, but sometimes open surgical repair is needed. </p><p>The classification and management of endoleaks that result from endovascular repair of the aortic aneurysm will be reviewed here. Types of endovascular devices and endovascular repair of abdominal aorta and thoracic aorta are reviewed separately.

One of the limitations of endovascular repair is the need for ongoing surveillance, primarily to identify type II endoleak, which may require reintervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Persistent arterial perfusion of the aneurysm sac after endovascular treatment indicates a failure to completely exclude the aneurysm and is defined as endoleak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Endoleak is associated with an ongoing risk for aneurysm expansion or rupture.</p><p>The types of endoleak are classified by the source of the leak (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109609\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109609 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64707\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64707 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].

Contributing factors include mural thrombus; a short, angulated, dilated, severely calcified, or reverse-tapered aortic neck; and incorrect device sizing. The use of an endograft with or without suprarenal fixation does not seem to affect the risk of type I endoleak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type Ib &ndash; Distal type I endoleak is usually due to incorrect sizing of the iliac limbs or inadvertent deployment of the endograft limb, often because of excessive iliac tortuosity within the more proximal, larger iliac vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58986\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58986 \">image 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Late type Ia or type Ib endoleak can develop as a result of conformational changes in the aneurysm sac, aneurysmal degeneration of the aortic neck or iliac arteries, severe angulation at the fixation sites, or graft migration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68430\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68430 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99509\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99509 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II endoleaks are due to the presence of a patent inferior mesenteric artery or patent lumbar branches or, in the case of thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, patent intercostal arteries. These allow retrograde flow into the aneurysm sac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66670\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66670 \">image 5</a>). The incidence of type II endoleak has been correlated with the number of patent aortic branches prior to endovascular repair of the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For patients who do exhibit clinical manifestations, these may range from findings consistent with an unrepaired aneurysm to contained leak <span class=\"nowrap\">(back/flank</span> pain) or overt rupture (hemodynamic instability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/7,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,19</a>].</p><p>Endoleaks that pressurize the aneurysm sac sufficiently may be suspected on physical examination when the aneurysm remains pulsatile on palpation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1625348818\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of endoleak is frequently made at completion arteriography during endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) but may be identified on follow-up imaging that demonstrates blood outside the bounds of the endograft. For some types of endoleak, the source can be difficult to determine. </p><p>Post-EVAR imaging protocols to detect endoleaks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endograft migration rely on computed tomographic (CT) angiography, given its availability and standardization. CT angiography can provide sac size and volume measurements, which can help guide surveillance and management, particularly when an endoleak cannot be clearly identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Duplex ultrasound with or without contrast as well as magnetic resonance (MR) angiography have been suggested as alternative imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In a systematic review that included 11 studies, MR imaging detected more endoleaks compared with CT angiography, particularly type II leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Duplex ultrasound is less expensive and safer, and may be more sensitive for the diagnosis of endoleaks, although this remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/7,21,23,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21,23,25-28</a>]. Duplex ultrasound has the specific advantage of detecting flow direction of endoleaks, facilitating identification of the type of endoleak; Doppler waveforms may even be able to predict the natural history of type II endoleaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound may have better accuracy, particularly for endoleak detection and classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Unfortunately, ultrasound accuracy is operator-dependent, and technical difficulties limit its universal application, particularly in patients with large body habitus. Wireless pressure sensors implanted during endovascular aneurysm repair have shown some value in monitoring intrasac pressure, but sufficient data supporting their use are still lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Most type I and type III endoleaks will be identified with completion arteriography. Some type II endoleaks may also be identified during the completion angiogram, provided that delayed images are taken. If type II endoleak is not apparent initially, it may be identified during surveillance. Since the aneurysm sac fills through collaterals, to properly detect type II endoleak on CT angiography, three runs are required: one without intravenous contrast, one with contrast, and a third delayed run during the venous phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Nonetheless, detection of type II endoleaks can be challenging, and they can be easily missed due to low flow, or they may not be seen if other types of endoleak cause intravenous contrast overlap. </p><p>Component separation associated with type III endoleak can be identified with plain abdominal films and confirmed with CT angiography. It may not be easy to distinguish component separation from a type I or type II endoleak, and it is even more difficult to differentiate type II endoleak when the source of the leak is a fabric tear. Type III endoleak is usually easily recognized with conventional arteriography but may require selective limb imaging with contralateral limb balloon occlusion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3906089834\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOLEAK MANAGEMENT AFTER EVAR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoleaks occurring at any time after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) are reported to occur in 20 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Type II endoleak is the most commonly reported endoleak, representing over 50 percent of all endoleaks.

Type I leak can occur immediately after device placement or can develop later over time. The majority of type I endoleaks are identified during completion arteriography at the time of the endovascular procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79443\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79443 \">image 1</a>). If not captured or present at completion, they are usually identified during the one-month or annual surveillance imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79584\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79584 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F99509\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99509 \">image 4</a>). Type I leak should be repaired as soon as it is discovered to prevent adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].<sup> </sup>Several studies have shown a significant association between type I endoleak and late rupture, open conversion, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/10,14,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,34,35</a>]. </p><p>Even with meticulous planning including judicious patient and stent-graft <span class=\"nowrap\">selection/sizing</span> and implantation of the stent-graft with optimal positioning, type I endoleak is still reported. The incidence of type I endoleak ranges between 3 and 21 percent of endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs, with the higher incidences reflecting difficult anatomic situations (eg, short neck), failing first-generation endografts, endografts used outside the manufacturer's instructions for use (IFU), or very small endoleaks captured on higher-quality imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/10,31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31,36</a>].</p><p>In the largest published series coming from the EUROSTAR registry (3595 patients, 1996 to 2002), the overall reported incidence of type I endoleak was approximately 7 percent (3.3 percent type Ia endoleak, 3.7 percent type Ib endoleak), but the overall incidence increased to 10 percent during follow-up. Many of these eventually resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/31,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,37,38</a>]. In a review of 2402 patients from the Vascular Study Group of New England database from 2003 to 2012, type I endoleak was identified in 3.3 percent of EVARs at completion of surgery. Approximately 1 percent of patients with no type I endoleak during initial completion arteriography developed new type I endoleak at one-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3231403357\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial approach to type I endoleak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For type I endoleaks identified at the time of endograft placement, the initial approach consists of reballooning the fixation sites and possibly the reversal of intraoperative anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109610\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109610 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H43518639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For proximal type Ia endoleaks that persist after reballooning, the placement of additional aortic cuffs or a balloon-expandable stent (eg, Palmaz) increases the radial force exerted by the proximal graft and maximizes apposition of the graft to the aortic wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In cases where the graft is deployed flush with the lowest renal artery and appears well apposed to the aortic wall, observation is reasonable since many of these will resolve at one-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For distal type Ib endoleaks that persist after balloon angioplasty of the distal attachment site, iliac limb extensions are used. If the iliac limb has been undersized, a flared iliac extension limb can be placed to exclude the endoleak. If the distal common iliac artery does not have an adequate length to provide a proper seal, coil embolization of the origin of the hypogastric artery and placement of a limb extension into the external iliac artery may be necessary. It is important to maintain pelvic perfusion through the contralateral hypogastric artery to minimize the risk for pelvic ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair#H958076909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of endovascular abdominal aortic repair&quot;, section on 'Pelvic ischemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p>These techniques are usually sufficient to repair type I endoleak and exclude the aneurysm. If unsuccessful, a conservative approach may be justified, particularly when remaining endovascular options are not feasible and conversion to open repair is considered high-risk. Watchful waiting of selected patients may lead to resolution of type I endoleak. Based on early experience, spontaneous closure of the type I endoleak was thought to be uncommon; however, later studies indicated that small, low-flow endoleaks may have high resolution rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/10,36,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,36,41</a>]. The spontaneous disappearance of type Ia endoleak after appropriate stent-graft sizing and deployment in this subgroup is not surprising. Once perioperative coagulation abnormalities return to normal, the self-expanding nature of the stent-graft leads to gradual neck remodeling and improved aortic wall apposition. In a review of the Vascular Study Group of New England database, 90 percent of type I endoleaks resolved without the need for endovascular intervention or open conversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, high-flow type I endoleaks will typically lead to significant pressure elevation in the aneurysm sac and aneurysm expansion, which has been linked to an ongoing risk for rupture, open conversion, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/10,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161203454\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory and late type I endoleak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The percutaneous treatment of late or persistent type Ia endoleak can be challenging. In refractory cases, more advanced endovascular options may be needed. In situations where visceral branches preclude graft extension, glue or coil deposition in the tract between the stent-graft and the aortic wall has been used successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Alternatively, placement of stents in the renal and potentially superior mesenteric arteries alongside a proximal endograft extension (Chimney technique) potentially allows the resolution of type I endoleak with reasonable results in the mid-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Fenestrated or branched devices may also provide a solution for patients with appropriate anatomy but require advanced endovascular skills and expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].<sup> </sup>Endostaples (eg, Aptus Heli-FX) are also available and may be used preemptively to enhance proximal fixation and seal. Endostaples refer to single-attachment units that penetrate the stent-graft and secure it to the full thickness of the aortic wall. If used to treat an existing type I endoleak, they may not be as successful. A review of the Aneurysm Treatment Using the Heli-FX Aortic Securement System Global Registry (ANCHOR) showed that 34 percent of the patients with type Ia endoleak treated with endostaples had evidence of type Ia endoleak during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. </p><p>Late distal type I endoleak can be treated most of the time with graft extensions and a variety of surgical or endovascular maneuvers with preservation of flow to the hypogastric artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Open conversion is almost never required at the time of EVAR but is sometimes required for delayed type I endoleak. Conversion can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, although case series report rates comparable with de novo open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Open conversion can be performed via a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach, with initial proximal aortic control often above the renal arteries, depending upon the graft location and the presence of suprarenal fixation. Stepwise clamping more distally on the aorta is performed to reduce ischemic time, with complete or partial endograft removal. Partial explantation with in-situ graft replacement can be performed in the absence of graft infection, with the proximal suture line incorporating the suprarenal stents and the distal suture line of either a tube or bifurcated graft incorporating the iliac limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The main goal of treatment is to eliminate the aortic branches at their junction with the aneurysm to abolish side branch perfusion. A variety of endovascular, laparoscopic, and open techniques has been proposed to accomplish this goal. While all alternatives may have a role, endovascular techniques are preferred given their minimally invasive nature. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transarterial embolization &ndash; Transarterial embolization is the most common intervention for type II endoleak. Transfemoral or transbrachial access is obtained, and a coaxial system with microcatheters is used to reach the inferior mesenteric or lumbar arteries to embolize the nidus and the feeder branches of the endoleak. The approach is generally feasible through the internal iliac (superior gluteal) or superior mesenteric (middle colic and marginal) arteries depending upon the target and associated collateral vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109612\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109612 \">image 9</a>). Microcoils are mainly used, but glue, thrombin, and Onyx (ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer) can also be delivered, with no proven superiority of one agent over the other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86466\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86466 \">image 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Translumbar embolization &ndash; Translumbar embolization is a reasonable alternative when transfemoral access to the endoleak is not available (eg, occluded internal iliac or inferior mesenteric arteries, prior transarterial embolization). Not all vascular surgeons are familiar with this technique given the rare need for its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/7,66,69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,66,69-71</a>]. With the patient in prone position, access to the aneurysm sac is obtained under fluoroscopy, typically from a left paraspinal approach (approximately four fingers' breadth from midline). A sheath is introduced, and, following an aortic &quot;sacogram,&quot; a coaxial system with microcatheters is created to reach the nidus and the target arteries, similar to the transarterial approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109613\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109613 \">image 11</a>). Some authors have also suggested ventral or transcaval aneurysm sac puncture, but data are limited for these approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/66,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,72</a>].</p><p/><p>An important aspect of success, regardless of the approach used, is gaining access and embolizing the sac (nidus) with as many feeders (inflow and outflow) as possible, a task that requires advanced endovascular skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/27,55,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,55,71</a>]. Recurrence and subsequent reintervention are relatively frequent, and the sac may continue to expand. In a systematic review, the success rate, defined as no recurrence during follow-up, averaged 62.5 percent (range 15 to 89 percent) for the transarterial approach and 81 percent (range 67 to 100 percent) for the translumbar approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].<sup> </sup>All studies that compared transarterial with translumbar approaches have shown better results for the translumbar method; however, in the majority of cases, translumbar embolization was the second-line treatment after a transarterial approach had failed, and thus such comparisons may not be valid. In a later study that reviewed outcomes of 386 patients who underwent infrarenal AAA repair over a 10-year period (2006 to 2015), no difference in success rate was seen for treatment of type II endoleak when comparing the transarterial (17 patients) with a translumbar (11 patients) approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>Should type II endoleak persist and the sac continue to expand following &quot;technically&quot; successful embolizations, or when embolization is not possible, a surgical approach may become necessary.

The main technical challenge is cannulation of the main body gate, which can be particularly difficult if the components are offset. Once cannulation has been accomplished, a new iliac limb graft can be deployed. Another option is to deploy a new bifurcated stent-graft, thereby rebuilding an entirely new device within the existing device.

Increased component instability and aortic mortality in these patients underscore the need to obtain a durable seal with the index operation. </p><p>The chimney technique preserves vital aortic branches in aortic endovascular repair by deploying a covered stent into a vital aortic side branch parallel to the main aortic stent-graft. In this manner, the sealing zone of the aortic stent-graft can be extended beyond the origin of the vital side branch. However, one concern is the so-called gutter endoleak (leak between the main aortic graft and the parallel stent) causing a type I endoleak. A systematic review that involved 831 patients showed a 13 percent rate of early type I endoleak for the visceral chimneys and 11 percent rate for the arch chimneys. Most type I endoleaks were handled conservatively. Late type I endoleak was reported in 25 visceral and 4 percent of arch chimney cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>Comparisons between <span class=\"nowrap\">fenestrated/branched</span> and chimney techniques has not shown differences in endoleak rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2000922885\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoleaks are best prevented by proper patient and device selection.

Assuming appropriate patient selection and graft sizing, measures to prevent type I endoleak include correcting radiologic parallax to ensure correct positioning and appropriate balloon inflation of the attachment sites once the device is correctly deployed. </p><p>Techniques have been proposed to prevent type II endoleak, but their use remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/50,102-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,102-107</a>]. Some advocate preoperative or intraoperative embolization (or other techniques) to occlude patent aortic side branches with variable success rates. However, this is associated with longer procedure duration, longer fluoroscopy times, risk of coil dislocation, and higher costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].<sup> </sup>These risks may outweigh any benefit gained so these prevention strategies for type II endoleak are not widespread.

Endoleaks are associated with a continued risk for aneurysm expansion or rupture. (See <a href=\"#H3722227337\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of endoleak is made when imaging demonstrates blood outside the bounds of the endograft. This often occurs during completion arteriography at the time of endograft placement. If the endoleak is not apparent initially, it may be identified during postoperative surveillance. Endoleaks have been reported as late as five years after endograft placement, underscoring the importance of ongoing surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H650877650\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1625348818\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoleaks are classified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109609\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109609 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64707\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64707 \">figure 1</a>) based upon the source of the leak, which determines their clinical significance and treatment. Continued aneurysm sac expansion without a demonstrable endoleak on any imaging modality is referred to as endoleak of undefined origin. (See <a href=\"#H3722227337\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I endoleak is due to an incompetent seal at the proximal (type Ia) or distal (type Ib) attachment sites. These can occur early at the time of endograft placement or late as a result of graft migration or conformational changes of the aorta or graft. Type I endoleaks are repaired as soon as they are discovered, which typically involves reballooning the attachment sites or the placement of additional stent components. Conversion to open repair for type I endoleak is rarely necessary at the time of the initial endograft placement but may be necessary for persistent type I endoleak. Watchful waiting of selected patients (persistent low-flow endoleak, high risk for open surgery) may lead to resolution of type I endoleak. (See <a href=\"#H1846660251\" class=\"local\">'Type I endoleak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II endoleak is the most prevalent type and is due to a patent inferior mesenteric artery or other aortic branches (eg, lumbar, accessory renal). Detecting type II endoleak on computed tomographic (CT) angiography requires delayed image acquisition. For most patients with type II endoleak, we suggest observation and surveillance, rather than any form of intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Spontaneous resolution of type II endoleak is common. Repeat CT imaging can be performed at 12 months, and provided there is no evidence for aneurysm expansion, subsequent duplex ultrasound can be performed annually. Treatment is indicated only for sac expansion &gt;5 mm during interval follow-up. Options for obliteration of type II endoleaks include transarterial embolization (most common), translumbar embolization, or surgical intervention, which is generally reserved for those that do not resolve by other means. (See <a href=\"#H1976017016\" class=\"local\">'Type II endoleak'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1213927085\" class=\"local\">'Alterations to surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III endoleak is due to junctional leak or disconnection of the endograft components (type IIIa) or holes in the endograft fabric (type IIIb). The incidence of type III endoleak is overall low due to improved endograft technology and longer overlap zones as well as improvements in fabric and material testing that have nearly eliminated this type of failure. Component separation associated with type III endoleak can be identified with plain abdominal films and confirmed with CT angiography. As with type I endoleak, type III endoleaks can occur early or late and require treatment when identified. The treatment typically involves placement of additional stent-graft components to seal the fabric defect or provide a bridge across the disconnected components and, in some cases, relining the endograft. (See <a href=\"#H3027584171\" class=\"local\">'Type III endoleak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV endoleak is associated with graft porosity and is self-limited, typically resolving in 24 hours. It has been associated with some thin polyester grafts but has not been universally noted with endografts prone to it. Type IV endoleak has not been associated with any long-term adverse events and does not require specific treatment. It is important to note that type IV endoleak can be quite disconcerting to see at completion arteriography, and, more importantly, it can obscure the identification of more serious type I or type III endoleaks. (See <a href=\"#H1291701138\" class=\"local\">'Type IV endoleak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) similarly require ongoing surveillance to evaluated for endoleak. Following TEVAR, type I and type III endoleak requires definitive repair. A hybrid procedure that uses debranching of the supraaortic vessels may be needed to allow extension of the seal zones for supplemental endografting. As with type II endoleaks following EVAR, post-TEVAR type II endoleaks require reintervention only if they are associated with aneurysm expansion. Those related to the left subclavian artery can be treated by ligation, plugging, or coiling of the subclavian artery with or without left subclavian revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H1431932072\" class=\"local\">'Endoleak management after TEVAR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex fenestrated, branched, and chimney endografts introduce the potential for additional modes of failure in terms of component separation and endoleaks. Treatment of endoleaks associated with these devices remains challenging. (See <a href=\"#H440265771\" class=\"local\">'Endoleak management after complex abdominal endografting'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoleak-following-endovascular-aortic-repair/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chaikof EL, Brewster DC, Dalman RL, et al.
