These are relatively benign ocular diseases that cause significant suffering and use of health care resources, although they typically do not threaten vision.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are reviewed here. The management of these disorders is reviewed separately.

It is predominantly a disease of young adults, with an average age of onset of 20 years. Symptoms tend to decrease with age, but older adults can continue to have severe symptoms.</p><p>It is possible to develop allergic conjunctivitis for the first time as an older adult, although this is not typical. The patient should be questioned about environmental changes (eg, a newly acquired pet or a new living arrangement) and symptoms earlier in life. In older adults, dry eye disease, blepharitis, and toxic conjunctivitis can mimic allergic conjunctivitis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Allergic conjunctivitis is associated with other allergic diseases, particularly allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Asthma and atopic dermatitis are other common comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4517433\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic conjunctivitis results from allergens contacting the surface of the eye in a person who is allergic to that specific allergen. It is a classic type I immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity, which is similar to the pathophysiology of other atopic diseases.</p><p>Analysis of conjunctival scrapings reveals two phases of the allergic response, similar to the early and late phases of cutaneous, nasal, and pulmonary responses to allergen.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immediate response to allergens is mediated predominantly by mast cells, which are present in high concentrations in the conjunctival epithelium and increase further in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Mast cells become activated when allergens cross-link allergen-specific IgE on the cell surface, and chemical mediators are released by exocytosis. Histamine is the main mediator of the early response. It causes vasodilatation, vasopermeability, and itching. Both H1 receptors and H2 receptors play a role in ocular allergy. Elevated levels of histamine in tears have been measured in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The late phase of the allergic reaction begins with the influx of other inflammatory cells, which are attracted by the cytokines and chemokines released by mast cells in the immediate phase. Eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils appear 6 to 10 hours after allergen challenge, followed by lymphocytes and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Eosinophils produce and release leukotriene C<sub>4</sub>, eosinophilic peroxidase, eosinophilic cationic protein, and histamine into the tear fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The activity of these cells creates continued inflammation. More detailed discussions of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of atopy are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-allergic-rhinitis-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis (rhinosinusitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Eosinophils can be demonstrated in conjunctival scrapings in up to 80 percent of patients with acute allergic conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Elevated levels of IgE in tear film are characteristic of allergic conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Serum total IgE may also be elevated in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Histamine and tryptase levels can be measured in tears following conjunctival allergen challenge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19672399\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic conjunctivitis can be subdivided into three specific conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute allergic conjunctivitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19672422\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute allergic conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute allergic conjunctivitis is a sudden-onset hypersensitivity reaction that is caused by environmental exposure, usually to a known allergen, such as cat dander [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Symptoms can develop rapidly (ie, as quickly as 30 minutes). Once exposure to the allergen has ended, symptoms generally resolve within 24 hours. Thus, the acute form of allergic conjunctivitis is characterized by intense episodes of itching, hyperemia, tearing, chemosis, and eyelid edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19672428\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) goes by several other names, including allergic conjunctivitis, hay fever type conjunctivitis, or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (when nasal symptoms are also present). It is frequently associated with rhinitis and is attributable to outdoor airborne pollens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. SAC typically has a less dramatic onset compared with acute allergic conjunctivitis, developing over days to weeks, and a predictable course that corresponds to one or more specific pollen seasons.</p><p>Seasonal allergens include tree pollens in the spring, grass pollens in the summer, and weed pollens in the late summer and fall, although there is some variation based upon geographic location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74234 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19672434\"><span class=\"h2\">Perennial allergic conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) is a mild, chronic, waxing and waning allergic conjunctivitis related to environmental exposure to year-round, usually indoor allergens, such as dust mites, animal danders, and molds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ocular pruritus is a prominent symptom, such that the absence of pruritus should prompt consideration of other disorders. Patients may report burning. Redness is also nearly universal. Eyelid edema is common. Symptoms are usually bilateral. However, one eye can be affected more than the other. Patients may report some mild crusting upon awakening, but the discharge is characteristically watery and nonpurulent. Mild photophobia may be present.</p><p>Eye pain is not characteristic of allergic conjunctivitis. Ocular pain should raise concern for more serious disorders, such as angle-closure glaucoma, scleritis, or episcleritis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2895603\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with allergic conjunctivitis often have a history of atopy, seasonal allergy, or specific allergy (eg, to cats or dust mites). Accordingly, they should be asked about similar symptoms in the past and the presumed triggers for the symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H19672399\" class=\"local\">'Types of allergic conjunctivitis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2895582\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical findings include redness (hyperemia), tearing or clear watery discharge, burning, and conjunctival edema (chemosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57240\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57240 \">picture 1</a>). In extreme instances, the edematous conjunctiva can extend forward, beyond the lid margins. Eyelid edema is also common.</p><p>Allergic eye disease primarily affects the conjunctiva. The redness or injection in allergic conjunctivitis should be diffuse, involving the bulbar (globe) conjunctiva, as well as the palpebral or tarsal conjunctiva (the mucus membrane on the inner surface of the lids).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another diagnosis such as foreign body, pterygium, scleritis, or episcleritis should be considered if the conjunctival injection is localized rather than diffuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pterygium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pterygium&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=episcleritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Episcleritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness that is most intense around the iris (a ciliary flush pattern) should prompt consideration of serious conditions (iritis, acute angle closure), and patients with this finding should be referred to an ophthalmologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Conjunctival papillae may be detected if the underside of the eyelid is examined by eversion. Video instructions for everting the upper eyelid are found separately.

Each papilla has a vascular core of fine, dilated telangiectatic blood vessels. They are usually found on the upper tarsal conjunctiva.</p><p>Conjunctival follicles are less commonly seen in allergic conjunctivitis, although they may be present in chronic disease. Follicles are more common in longstanding, T cell-mediated conditions. They are lymphoid germinal centers that appear as smooth, rounded nodules beneath the conjunctival epithelium. The upper surface is avascular, and the base is surrounded by fine vessels. Follicles are most common in the lower fornix, at the margin between tarsal and palpebral conjunctiva.</p><p>Cobblestoning and giant papillae should not be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74752\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74752 \">picture 2</a>). These findings suggest more severe forms of ocular allergy (ie, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, or giant papillary keratoconjunctivitis). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Infraorbital edema and darkening may be present due to subcutaneous venodilation, findings that are sometimes referred to as &quot;allergic shiners.&quot; Patients with longstanding symptoms may show accentuated transverse lines or folds below the lower lids (Dennie-Morgan lines).</p><p>In patients with concomitant symptoms of allergic rhinitis, examination of the nasal mucosa can show several characteristic findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pale bluish hue or pallor of the nasal mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema of the nasal turbinates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear rhinorrhea may be visible in the nasal cavity</p><p/><p>If the nasal passages are obstructed, clear rhinorrhea may be visible dripping down the posterior pharynx.</p><p>Finally, examination of the tympanic membranes in patients with significant nasal mucosal swelling and eustachian tube dysfunction may show accumulation of clear serous fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis#H7950204\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Physical findings'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4516960\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is made clinically based upon a suggestive clinical history and consistent signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Laboratory tests are generally not needed in order to initiate therapy. However, evaluation for allergy to specific substances should be pursued if the patient does not respond as expected to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4517058\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4517058\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral to an ophthalmologist should be considered in situations where the diagnosis is unclear.</p><p>Referral to an allergy specialist should be considered if it is unclear to what allergen the patient is likely reactive, since identification of the culprit allergen(s) will facilitate avoidance. This is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-management#H12817893\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic conjunctivitis: Management&quot;, section on 'Referral'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of these findings includes infectious conjunctivitis, blepharitis, dry eye, and more severe forms of allergic eye disease. There are no universally specific signs or symptoms that differentiate these conditions in all cases, and more than one condition can coexist in the same patient. However, there are several features that can help distinguish allergic conjunctivitis from other disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>More severe forms of allergic ocular disease</strong> &ndash; More severe disorders that have an allergic etiology include vernal conjunctivitis, giant papillary keratoconjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Vernal keratoconjunctivitis</strong> is a more severe disorder that usually affects boys living in warm, dry, subtropical climates. It presents with intense ocular pruritus, stringy mucoid discharge, and cobblestoning. Like allergic conjunctivitis, it can vary with the seasons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vernal-keratoconjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vernal keratoconjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Giant papillary conjunctivitis</strong> is a form of hypersensitivity reaction to contact lenses, ocular sutures, or ocular implants. It presents with itching and a sensation of grittiness or foreign body. Giant papillae are seen in this disorder but not in allergic conjunctivitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giant-papillary-conjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giant papillary conjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Atopic keratoconjunctivitis</strong> is a chronic and severe disorder that can affect the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea. Patients are typically adults between 30 and 50 years of age with atopic dermatitis. The most common symptom is severe pruritus, sometimes with seasonal variability. Eyelids can become thickened and lichenified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-keratoconjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic keratoconjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral infection</strong> &ndash; Allergic conjunctivitis is often accompanied by significant ocular pruritus, whereas this is not very common in infection. Infection is usually unilateral, although it can be bilateral, whereas allergic conjunctivitis is usually bilateral. Bacterial infections produce some degree of purulent discharge and are unlikely to be mistaken for allergic conjunctivitis, but viral infections can present more subtly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;, section on 'Viral conjunctivitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dry eye</strong> &ndash; Allergic conjunctivitis principally affects the conjunctiva, whereas the principal target tissue in dry eye is the cornea. Corneal involvement is characterized by vital dye uptake. This test can readily be performed by an ophthalmologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blepharitis</strong> &ndash; Blepharitis principally affects the eyelids or lid margins, whereas allergic conjunctivitis affects the conjunctiva. Eyelid involvement is characterized by vascularization of lids, changes in meibomian glands, and presence of lid dander. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxic conjunctivitis</strong> &ndash; Toxic conjunctivitis is an irritant reaction to ocular medications, and affected patients have typically been using ocular medications for extended periods of time. The most commonly implicated agents are preservatives in eye medications, contact lens solutions, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>. Conjunctival injection, chemosis, mucus discharge, papillary or follicular reaction of the palpebral conjunctiva, and itching are common. The eyelids can become swollen, thickened, and excoriated, findings which are uncommon in allergic conjunctivitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-conjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic conjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ocular rosacea</strong> &ndash; Ocular rosacea commonly presents with burning, itching, foreign body sensation, dryness, tearing, or photophobia. Physical findings include conjunctival hyperemia, blepharitis, and lid margin telangiectasias. Often, the severity of these symptoms is greater than would be expected, based upon the objective clinical findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Keratitis</strong> &ndash; Allergic conjunctivitis is often bilateral, affecting the cornea. Keratitis, which can be sterile (eg, due to contact lens wear) or infectious, typically presents unilaterally with corneal involvement and may be associated with vision loss. The presence of corneal infiltrates distinguishes this condition from allergic conjunctivitis, although corneal involvement may be subtle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of contact lenses&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-keratitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex keratitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angle-closure glaucoma</strong> &ndash; Allergic conjunctivitis is often bilateral and not associated with vision loss or pain. Angle-closure glaucoma is most always associated with severe unilateral pain and vision loss, due to corneal edema. However, angle-closure glaucoma can be mistaken for allergic conjunctivitis, since both disorders may cause redness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angle-closure glaucoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Episcleritis/scleritis</strong></span> &ndash; Allergic conjunctivitis is generally not associated with pain, while both scleritis and episcleritis are associated with significant pain, although the pain of episcleritis may be delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=episcleritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Episcleritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-scleritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of scleritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194973659\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
