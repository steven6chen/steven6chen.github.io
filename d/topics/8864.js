They are common injuries, particularly to the plantar surface of the foot and other areas of the distal extremities, and occur in all age groups. Infections, ranging from mild soft tissue involvement to osteomyelitis, are the main complication resulting from puncture wound injuries.</p><p>The clinical aspects, management, and prevention of puncture wound infections are reviewed here. Infections associated with puncture wounds that occur in specialized settings such as with animal or human bites and water exposure are discussed in further detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-following-water-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections following water exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prevention of HIV and infection with hepatitis viruses following a needlestick exposure is also discussed in detail elsewhere.

Puncture wounds to the sole of the foot from stepping on an object are the most common. The majority of plantar puncture wounds are due to nails; less commonly, glass, wood, or other metal objects are the source of the puncture. Puncture wounds around the area of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints often penetrate deeper because this is a weight-bearing area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The incidence of infection following a puncture wound is uncertain, as many individuals do not present to medical care following such injuries. As an example, in a survey of 200 general emergency department patients, 44 percent reported at least one prior plantar puncture wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of the 156 wound reported, 50 percent were brought to medical attention, among which the self-reported infection rate was 11 percent.</p><p>Soft tissue and systemic infections can also complicate intentional puncture injuries, such as body piercing or injection drug use. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis#H13087772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, screening, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Health risks'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505134814\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors associated with infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors associated with infection after a puncture wound include characteristics of the puncture (eg, location and depth of wound), material causing puncture, as well as host comorbidities. Most of the data on risk factors is from studies of plantar puncture wounds or extrapolated from other types of injuries.</p><p>In serial analyses of a patient population over a seven-year period, the risk of infection after a puncture wound to the foot was increased in patients who had either injury to the forefoot or wore shoes at the time of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Superficial wounds generally heal without complications, but deeper penetration from the puncture is a risk factor for more serious infection. Retained foreign bodies are also a likely risk factor for infection following puncture wound, based on evidence from lacerating injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Diabetes mellitus is a host risk factor for serious infection following puncture wound. In a retrospective study of 146 patients hospitalized with puncture wounds, of whom 77 had diabetes mellitus (some with neuropathy as well), diabetes mellitus was associated with later presentation to medical care following puncture injury (8.7 versus 5.3 days in those without diabetes mellitus) and subsequent osteomyelitis (35 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a subsequent analysis of the same cohorts, those with diabetes mellitus were five times as likely to require multiple operations and 46 times as likely to have a lower extremity amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Other risk factors for infection following a penetrating injury include increased age and wound contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Injury with organic or vegetative material is generally considered to be a risk factor for infection. In addition, immunodeficiency has been associated with puncture-related infections, in particular with organisms acquired from water exposure at the time of injury (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-following-water-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections following water exposure&quot;</a>). Some have speculated that immunocompromised hosts are also at particular risk of infection after tattooing and body piercing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections complicating puncture wounds can be caused by a variety of microorganisms. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and beta-hemolytic streptococci are common causes of skin and soft tissue infections and can produce wound infections after puncture. Gram-negative bacteria also have been recovered from infected sites. In particular, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> is commonly isolated in patients who suffered plantar puncture while wearing tennis shoes, perhaps due to the moist inner sole of the shoe which provides a suitable environment for growth of this organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In one series, the most common pathogen causing osteomyelitis after a puncture injury was <em>S. aureus</em> in patients with diabetes mellitus and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Polymicrobial osteomyelitis occurs more frequently in the setting of diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin and soft tissue infections&quot;, section on 'Infection following nail puncture'</a>.)</p><p><em>P. aeruginosa</em> is also the most common organism associated with infections following piercing through ear cartilage. In one systematic review of 39 patients with perichondritis following ear piercing and documented bacterial cultures, 87 percent were caused by <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and 5 percent by <em>S. aureus </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Atypical organisms, such as nontuberculous mycobacteria and fungal species, are also reported causes of infections complicating body piercing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of the eye, ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system&quot;, section on 'Perichondritis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=body-piercing-in-adolescents-and-young-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Body piercing in adolescents and young adults&quot;, section on 'Localized infection'</a>.) </p><p>The range of organisms also depends on the setting in which the injury was sustained. An injury that occurred in the setting of water exposure (eg, punctures from fish hooks, spines of sea creatures, and shells) should raise the possibility of <em>Aeromonas </em>species, <em>Edwardsiella tarda</em>, <em>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</em>, <em>Vibrio</em> species, and <em>Mycobacterium marinum </em>(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-following-water-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections following water exposure&quot;</a>). <em>Streptococcus iniae</em> has also been reported to cause infections complicating puncture wounds that occur during preparation of fresh seafood for ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, puncture in a farm setting might prompt consideration of bowel flora of farm animals as possible pathogens.</p><p>Fungal and other mycobacterial organisms have been associated with puncture infections from plant or organic material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Tooth pick injuries can be associated with polymicrobial oral flora infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505135287\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum of infectious complications following a puncture wound includes cellulitis, soft tissue abscess, septic arthritis, tenosynovitis, necrotizing soft tissue infection, and osteomyelitis.

In two studies of adults and children hospitalized for plantar puncture wound infections, the mean time to presentation from the initial injury was four days, although some patients did not present until several weeks later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29291323\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a patient following a puncture wound includes a careful history to identify risk factors for infection and other complications, examination of the involved area for signs of infection and injury to the tendon, nerve or vascular structures, and assessment for retained foreign material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105841\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105841 \">algorithm 1</a>).

The area should be inspected and palpated for retained foreign material and signs of infection, including abscess. The vascular, tendon, and neurologic status of the involved area should be evaluated. Even small puncture wounds can result in damage of deeper structures. Pain with passive movement, crepitus, pain out of proportion to exam, and purulence should be clues to deeper infection such as deep space abscess, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, necrotizing soft tissue infection, or tenosynovitis, even in the absence of superficial changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505137107\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical management decisions are generally based on history, physical, and imaging findings. There is limited utility to laboratory tests, such as peripheral white blood cell count and inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein). These tests have not been shown to reliably identify or rule out infection following puncture wounds, including deeper infections such as necrotizing soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition, these tests are not predictors of outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, clinical management decisions should not hinge on laboratory markers alone, especially in the setting of diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, or an otherwise concerning clinical exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505134755\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following a puncture wound, imaging can be helpful to evaluate for the presence of a retained foreign body and to evaluate for a soft tissue, joint, or bone infection or delineate its extent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105841\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105841 \">algorithm 1</a>). We perform radiographic evaluation in patients who present with evidence of infection and have not had previous imaging for a foreign body and in patients with relapsing or worsening infection despite local wound care and antibiotic administration. We also perform imaging in patients with suspected deep infection (ie, of the joint or bone), such as those who present with progressive pain several days after the injury, pain out of proportion to superficial exam, pain with passive movement, crepitus, joint swelling, or systemic illness, particularly after deep injuries and with certain host comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, neuropathy, or immunocompromising condition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Otherwise, the decision to perform imaging to evaluate for a foreign body should be individualized. Some features that support imaging for this purpose include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to completely visualize the interior of the wound</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep wounds caused by glass</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient believes there is a retained object</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the object is small, thin, breakable, or brittle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the object can easily be buried beneath the skin surface, as with a sewing needle </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is severe wound pain, persistent and localized tenderness over the wound, or a painful mass or discoloration under the skin surface</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is a missing portion of the penetrating object or if penetrating injury occurred through a rubber shoe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p/><p>For patients with known or suspected deep infection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent tool to determine and define the presence of soft tissue abscess, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Computed tomography (CT) should be employed instead of MRI in patients with possible retention of metallic foreign bodies. CT should also be considered in those with concern for soft tissue abscess or soft tissue infection when MRI is not immediately available and time is of importance due to the severity of the clinical presentation. Triple-phase technetium bone scan lacks anatomic detail and specificity, and thus is not as useful for distinguishing bone from soft tissue involvement. Acute bone trauma caused by a foreign object without accompanying infection also can produce a positive bone scan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Otherwise, plain radiographs can be sufficiently sensitive to identify certain foreign bodies, depending on its density, configuration, size, and orientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Use of an underpenetrated, soft tissue technique may improve the sensitivity of the plain film for foreign bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Ultrasonography is also widely available and can be particularly useful to detect radiolucent objects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/17,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27</a>]. CT and MRI have also been used to detect foreign bodies; MRI may not be available in a timely fashion and cannot be used to identify metallic foreign bodies. Nevertheless, MRI can be helpful when other techniques have failed to detect the presence of a suspected foreign body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505136550\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying the microbial etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Debridement of infected tissue and drainage of soft tissue abscesses is an important component of the treatment of puncture wound infections (see <a href=\"#H3003095\" class=\"local\">'Debridement and drainage'</a> below). Additionally, it yields specimens for microbiological evaluation to identify the causative pathogen, which may be distinct from pathogens involved in general skin and soft tissue infections. All surgical specimens in the setting of puncture wounds should be sent for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, with in vitro susceptibility testing of aerobic bacterial pathogens. Additional microbiological tests (eg, mycobacterial and fungal cultures) are warranted if the patient reports an unusual exposure (eg, fish tank, vegetative matter) or if previous routine bacterial cultures have been unrevealing. In general, superficial cultures of wounds should be interpreted with caution, as the results do not correlate reliably with the pathogen in the deeper tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In patients with simple cellulitis not requiring drainage or debridement, decisions regarding likely pathogens should be made based on the puncture exposure history and patient risk factors, as reliable cultures generally cannot be obtained from such patients. </p><p>Blood cultures can be obtained in systemically ill patients, although yield is typically low and the risk of false positives likely outweighs the benefit in patients without systemic infection. Blood cultures are more likely to be useful in patients who are immunosuppressed or who have necrotizing skin infections. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29291341\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cellulitis or soft tissue abscess following a puncture wound infection is made based on the clinical findings of skin erythema, edema, and warmth or a tender, erythematous, fluctuant nodule associated with the wound site. A deeper infection (deep-tissue abscess, necrotizing soft tissue infection, septic arthritis, tenosynovitis or osteomyelitis) is suspected in patients with progressive pain several days following the initial puncture injury, pain with passive movement of the extremity, pain out of proportion to external exam (particularly if the injury was deep) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent signs of soft tissue infection despite initial wound care and antibiotic administration. The level of suspicion should be particularly high for patients who are immunosuppressed, have diabetes mellitus, or have neuropathy, as these patients often present later in their course with increased risk of serious infection and limited pain on clinical exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>].

Surgical debridement is generally warranted for retention of a foreign body in the foot in the setting of infection, rapidly progressive infection, or deep space infection (abscess, necrotic soft tissue, tenosynovitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis). Other clinical features that might portend a worse outcome with infections, such as diabetes mellitus or poor wound characteristics, may be additional reasons to favor surgical intervention. Additionally, we favor surgical intervention when signs and symptoms of infection occur despite prophylactic antibiotics. </p><p>Surgical specimens should be submitted for microbiological evaluation to identify the causative pathogen(s).

In cases of known or suspected osteomyelitis, empiric antibiotic therapy can be held until adequate specimens are obtained for culture as long as the patient is not systemically ill and has no evidence of rapidly progressive or serious soft tissue infection.

Thus, it is prudent for empiric antimicrobial treatment of infected plantar puncture wounds to be active against both organisms.

Puncture wounds to the sole of the foot from stepping on an object are the most common. Risk factors for infection include characteristics of the puncture (eg, deeply penetrating wounds, injuries to the forefoot or through shoes), the nature of the puncturing object (eg, contaminated objects, organic or vegetative material), and host comorbidities (eg, increased age, diabetes mellitus). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spectrum of infectious complications following a puncture wound includes cellulitis, soft tissue abscess, septic arthritis, tenosynovitis, necrotizing soft tissue infection, and osteomyelitis. Infectious complications typically present within several days following a puncture wound. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and beta-hemolytic streptococci are common causes of wound infections after puncture. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> has been commonly isolated in patients who suffer plantar puncture while wearing tennis shoes. The range of organisms likely involved also depends on the setting in which the injury was sustained (eg, with water or animal exposure) or the material of the injuring object. (See <a href=\"#H505135287\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of a patient following a puncture wound includes careful history to identify risk factors for infection and other complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105841\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105841 \">algorithm 1</a>). This includes a description of the penetrating object, scene of the injury, depth of penetration, and the elapsed time since injury. The involved area should be assessed for signs of infection, injury to the tendon, nerve, or vascular structures, and retained foreign material. Infection of deep structures should be suspected in those who present with progressive pain several days after the injury, pain out of proportion to superficial exam, pain with passive movement, crepitus, joint swelling, or systemic illness, particularly after deep injuries and with certain host comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, neuropathy, or immunocompromising condition).

For patients with known or suspected deep infection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is preferred. Otherwise, plain radiographs or ultrasonography can identify foreign bodies. If infection is diagnosed or suspected, obtaining specimens to identify the microbial etiology is optimal for management, but not always possible. Superficial cultures of wounds should be interpreted with caution, as the results do not correlate reliably with the pathogen in the deeper tissues.
