Although the cancer is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the majority of patients will relapse with broadly resistant disease within a few months to a year from initial therapy.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of SCLC will be reviewed here.

Historically SCLC has been rare in never smokers, representing just 2.9 percent of the lung cancer cases in women, and none in men, from a case control series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The proportion of lung cancer in the United States that is classified as SCLC has steadily decreased. This was illustrated by an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, in which the proportion of SCLC declined from 17 percent in 1986 to 13 percent in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This overall decrease in incidence was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of cases of SCLC arising in women (28 percent in 1973 versus 50 percent in 2002).</p><p>These epidemiologic changes may be due to differences in smoking patterns (eg, decreased in men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, changes in the pathologic criteria for SCLC may have led to some cases being classified as having large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Initially, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified SCLC into the three histologic subtypes (oat cell, intermediate cell type, and combined [SCLC with non-small cell component (usually squamous cell or adenocarcinoma)]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This classification system has undergone progressive revisions that attempted to correlate histopathologic observations with clinical behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Small cell carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>The 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lung tumors eliminated intermediate cell carcinoma and added a new variant of large cell carcinoma (LCC) designated large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], which shares biologic and clinical features with SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Previously classified as a variant of LCC, and broadly as a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], LCNEC is grouped with the pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas in the 2015 WHO classification.

Large cell neuroendocrine cancer appears to have a biologic behavior that is similar to SCLC, which is supported by frequently shared gene expression and proteomic profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H4047701511\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=large-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A diagnosis of SCLC is based primarily upon light microscopy. Small cell carcinoma is characterized by small &quot;blue&quot; malignant cells about twice the size of lymphocytes. The cytoplasm is sparse, and nuclear features include finely dispersed chromatin without distinct nucleoli. In contrast, the cells of LCNEC are distinguished by the presence of prominent nucleoli, a more granular chromatin pattern, and variable amounts of cytoplasm. Mitotic rates are high, and necrosis of individual tumor cells is common. Nuclear molding is considered characteristic in well-preserved specimens, although a nondiagnostic &quot;crush&quot; artifact is more frequently observed. The neoplastic cells are typically arranged in clusters, sheets, or trabeculae, separated by a delicate fibrovascular stroma.</p><p>In the combined cell subtype, SCLC coexists with squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, LCC, or rarely spindle cell carcinoma. If SCLC coexists with large cell components, at least 10 percent of each component should be present. For other non-small cell elements, the presence of any amount indicates classification as &quot;combined.&quot; While coexistence with another cell type of carcinoma is rarely detected in untreated specimens, up to 30 percent of autopsies with SCLC demonstrate areas of differentiation into non-small cell carcinoma.</p><p>These findings have led to the hypothesis that pulmonary carcinogenesis occurs in a pluripotent stem cell capable of differentiation along several pathways. Further supporting this is the observation that approximately 14 percent of NSCLC tumors with EGFR mutations acquire SCLC morphology and expression of neuroendocrine markers as EGFR-inhibitor resistance evolves, and that these tumors are sensitive to standard SCLC regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In the combined cell subtype, metastatic disease usually contains predominantly SCLC even if the SCLC element is low. Therefore, standard SCLC treatment for patients with the combined subtype is appropriate.</p><p>The prognostic significance of the combined SCLC variant is unclear. In some reports, the combined variant has been more resistant to treatment and had a short survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, other reports suggest a more favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For SCLC and LCNEC, there are standard immunohistochemical markers for lung origin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuroendocrine features which are useful for establishing the diagnosis. Additionally, some molecular biomarkers, especially those that are potentially targetable, may be useful for guiding treatment in the future. However, unlike NSCLC where biomarkers such as <em>EGFR</em> mutations (for targeted therapies) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; for immunotherapies) have been incorporated into standard clinical practice, there are currently no molecular markers that are recommended for treatment selection for SCLC outside of clinical trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually all SCLCs are immunoreactive for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen because of their epithelial cellular origin. A majority will also express thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), which can help distinguish SCLC from neuroendocrine cancers originating in an organ other than the lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more markers of neuroendocrine differentiation can be found in approximately 75 percent of SCLCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast to LCNEC, the immunohistochemical demonstration of neuroendocrine differentiation is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Markers reflecting neuroendocrine and neural differentiation commonly used in the diagnostic setting include synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule [NCAM]). Expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), dopa decarboxylase, calcitonin, gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is also commonly observed.</p><p/><p>A subset of patients produce autoantibodies that crossreact with both SCLC cells and the central nervous system or the neuromuscular junction. These autoantibodies can cause cerebellar degenerative syndromes or the Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome. SCLC is the most common malignancy associated with neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis#H3052249120\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for malignancy'</a>.)</p><p>SCLC cells can also produce a number of polypeptide hormones, including ACTH and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), resulting in various paraneoplastic endocrinologic syndromes.

In addition to overexpression of these growth factors, the enzyme which inactivates these small polypeptide hormones, neural endopeptidase (CALLA), is underexpressed in SCLC cells and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, contemporary trials targeting IGF-1R with antibodies in combination with chemotherapy have not shown clinical benefit in unselected patients.

Multiple genetic defects have been detected; some are characteristic and perhaps involved with oncogenesis, whereas others are probably random or secondary events. A detailed discussion of the molecular genetic changes associated with neuroendocrine tumors is beyond the scope of this review. The most common characteristics of SCLC are summarized below and were recently reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>p53</em> mutations are detected in nearly all SCLC tumors (75 to 98 percent based on previous reports) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of the retinoblastoma gene (<em>RB1</em>) function at 13q14 is nearly ubiquitous in SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

The <em>FHIT</em> gene (for fragile histidine triad), which is involved in the accumulation of diadenosine tetraphosphate, thereby leading to DNA synthesis and proliferation, has been localized to 3p14.2 and is believed to be an important tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The initial evaluation of a patient with suspected lung cancer is discussed separately.

The most common presentation is that of a large hilar mass with bulky mediastinal adenopathy. Potential clinical consequences include cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and debility. Hemoptysis and postobstructive pneumonia are less common than with squamous cancers, for example, due to the diffuse submucosal, as opposed to intraluminal, growth pattern. Approximately 70 percent of patients present with overt metastatic disease; SCLC has a particular propensity to spread to liver, adrenals, bone, bone marrow, and brain.</p><p>SCLC can occasionally present as a peripheral nodule without central adenopathy. However, this presentation of SCLC is uncommon and a cytologic diagnosis alone (eg, from a fine needle aspirate) cannot be trusted to differentiate SCLC from other neuroendocrine cancers such as typical or atypical carcinoid, for which surgery should be strongly considered. In this situation, mediastinal staging followed by surgical resection is recommended. Histopathologic evaluation of the resected tumor frequently fails to confirm SCLC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of surgery in multimodality therapy for small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, SCLC can present with an endocrinologic or neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome.

This simple two-stage system carries both prognostic importance and implications for treatment that are similar to the value of TNM staging since patients with limited-stage disease are candidates for curative-intent chemoradiation and chemotherapy, while those with extensive-stage disease are treated with chemotherapy alone and consolidative or palliative radiation as clinically indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">TNM staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2007, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) proposed changes to the TNM non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging system, mainly in T and M descriptors and subsequent stage groupings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These changes in the lung cancer TNM system were incorporated into the AJCC seventh edition (2010), and again in the eighth edition (2017), which recommends TNM staging for SCLC as well as NSCLC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The applicability of the proposed changes to SCLC was validated in a study comparing the new system with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 6<sup>th</sup> edition criteria using 8088 clinically staged cases in the IASLC database diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This study demonstrated the applicability and improved prognostication of the proposed system compared with the UICC 6<sup>th</sup> edition, with both T and N descriptors, and overall stage groupings prognostic for survival with the exception of overlap in stage IA and II A, and IB and IIB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The prognostic import of the stage groupings was confirmed in a separate cohort of 4884 patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The two systems were further compared in 349 patients staged surgically, confirming trends toward decreasing survival with increased T, N, and overall stage classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The specific prognosis of patients with stage IV(M1a) by virtue of pleural or pericardial effusion or contralateral pulmonary metastasis was demonstrated in a cohort of 10,660 patients from the California Cancer Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Patients with stage M1a disease had outcomes for survival that were intermediate between stages I-IIIB and stage IV(M1b), as is also the case for patients with NSCLC.</p><p>Currently, TNM staging does not alter clinical management frequently due to the predominance of advanced stage at presentation, and it is less powerful in prognostication for SCLC than for NSCLC. TNM staging is most useful in the identification of patients for whom resection may be beneficial (ie, for patients that are thoroughly evaluated and have clinical stage I [T1-2N0] disease). In these cases, resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended; however, this applies to fewer than 5 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-surgery-in-multimodality-therapy-for-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of surgery in multimodality therapy for small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While recognizing the limitations of influence on current management, TNM staging should be incorporated into clinical research and in cancer registries for future reference since more precise stage classification could influence treatment approaches in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging workup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic therapy is required for all patients with tissue diagnosis of SCLC, including those with stage I disease. Therefore, the major therapeutic significance of staging is to guide the use of definitive chemoradiation and to lesser extent, surgery, as discussed above.</p><p>Prompt treatment is of greater importance than the complete ascertainment of every involved site of disease because of the rapid tempo of untreated SCLC. Most patients are diagnosed within three months of symptom onset, reflecting a short tumor doubling time, and may die quickly in the absence of effective therapy. Staging should not delay initiation of treatment more than seven days. Patients who are very symptomatic should be treated urgently with chemotherapy despite the absence of complete staging information. Staging can continue during and immediately after initial treatment.</p><p>A complete staging workup includes physical examination, hematologic and chemical laboratory profiles, chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, preferred) or CT imaging of brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and skeletal imaging. Skeletal imaging historically was conducted with technetium, but now more commonly uses 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Other tests that may be clinically indicated in selected cases include bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, thoracentesis, and pericardiocentesis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain imaging is positive in about 15 percent of patients at diagnosis, including 5 to 8 percent of asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. Early identification and treatment of brain metastases is important, as it results in a lower rate of chronic neurologic morbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow is involved in 15 to 30 percent of patients at presentation, but it represents a solitary site of metastatic disease in only 2 to 6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]; bone marrow biopsy is thus no longer used routinely in staging but is indicated in the evaluation of cytopenias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide bone scans with technetium are positive in up to 30 percent of patients without symptoms or an abnormal alkaline phosphatase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/58,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,61,62</a>].</p><p/><p>Outside of the context of a clinical trial, an abbreviated staging algorithm could be directed by symptoms and terminated as soon as extensive disease is documented. This latter strategy, the rule for many European trials, may become more prevalent in the United States in this time of health care parsimony and need for economic justification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Utility of PET scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PET with FDG is a noninvasive method to assess for mediastinal or distant metastases by detecting areas of high FDG uptake (ie, increased metabolic activity) consistent with malignancy. Although PET has been widely studied as a component of the staging evaluation for NSCLC, less data are available on its role in patients with SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-70</a>]. Most reports are retrospective and involve small numbers of patients. Few have included pathologic documentation of PET findings that resulted in either up- or down-staging or an alteration of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-positron-emission-tomography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thoracic positron emission tomography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PET is associated with 100 percent sensitivity for SCLC, and its use in initial staging results in stage shifting for 5 to 20 percent of patients, as illustrated by a retrospective report of 51 patients who were studied with both PET and CT at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. PET detected the thoracic disease in all 51 (100 percent). In 18 cases, patients were classified as having limited stage disease based upon results of CT; of these, two (11 percent) were reclassified as having extensive stage disease based upon the results of PET. Of the 33 patients with extensive stage disease on CT scan, six (18 percent) were restaged as having limited stage disease using PET. Similar findings were reported in a prospective study of 120 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. It is important to pathologically assess lesions that will alter patient management and are only identified by PET. This has been performed variably in the available literature.</p><p>PET may alter initial treatment through change either in stage or more commonly in refining thoracic radiation fields and doses. In a prospective study of 60 patients with limited stage, there was discrepancy between baseline PET and CT scans in 30 percent of patients, fairly equally distributed between extending or reducing involvement as indicated by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Although isolated nodal failure was observed in only 3 percent of patients, the overall rate of nodal failure was 33 percent. Further investigation of PET in radiation planning and influence on outcomes is required.</p><p>SUV values from PET scans have been investigated for their prognostic significance. In a study of 76 patients, the mean SUV values from all FDG-avid lesions were calculated and evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model with other prognostic indicators including stage, performance status, and lactate dehydrogenase. High mean values were correlated with other poor prognostic features and predicted poor survival in multivariate analysis for patients with both limited and extensive disease.

Although SCLC is highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the disease usually relapses within two years despite treatment. Overall, only 10 to 15 percent of patients with limited stage SCLC and 1 to 2 percent of patients with extensive stage SCLC survive beyond five years. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCLC is generally diagnosed by light microscopy. On routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, it is a small, blue, round cell tumor with cells two to three times the size of mature lymphocytes. The cytoplasm is sparse, and nuclear features include finely dispersed chromatin without distinct nucleoli. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most clinical settings, patients are evaluated as having either limited-stage disease or extensive-stage disease.

Furthermore, the TNM system should be adopted for clinical trials and tumor registry information as precise staging information may inform therapeutic advances in the future for identifying that small number of patients who may be surgical candidates (T1-2N0).

In addition to a physical examination, hematology, and chemical laboratory profiles, imaging of the chest, abdomen, skeleton, and brain is generally indicated. However, prompt treatment is of greater importance than the complete ascertainment of every involved site of disease because of the rapid tempo of untreated disease. An abbreviated evaluation is often sufficient to begin treatment. Completion of staging can proceed during and immediately following initial chemotherapy.
