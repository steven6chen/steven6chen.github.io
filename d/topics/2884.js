They can arise anywhere in the body, but are most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract (midgut carcinoids) and bronchus (foregut carcinoids) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56015 \">table 1</a>). Primary midgut carcinoid tumors metastasize to the liver or regional lymph nodes and may present with bowel obstruction. In 20 to 30 percent of patients, the initial presentation occurs as a result of hormone production, called the carcinoid syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors arising in the tubular digestive tract, lung, and genitourinary tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome are vasomotor changes (flushing) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55493\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55493 \">picture 1</a>), gastrointestinal hypermotility (secretory diarrhea), bronchospasm, and hypotension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63079 \">table 2</a>). These symptoms are caused by the release of vasoactive substances, including serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), 5-hydroxytryptophan, histamine, bradykinin, tachykinins, and prostaglandins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79329 \">table 3</a>). The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome is usually suspected by the clinical features and confirmed by identification of the primary tumor, localization of metastatic lesions, and detection of increased urinary excretion of the by-product of serotonin metabolism, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51368 \">figure 1</a>).

These deposits occur most commonly on the endocardium of valvular cusps, leaflets, papillary muscles and cords, cardiac chambers, and occasionally on the intima of the pulmonary arteries or aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74687 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>The affected cardiac valves in carcinoid heart disease have a white appearance with thickened leaflets and subvalvular apparatus with fused and shortened chordae and thickened papillary muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Microscopic examination demonstrates deposits of fibrous tissue. The carcinoid plaque is composed of smooth muscle cells, myofibroblasts, and an overlying endothelial cell layer. Smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts are surrounded by an extracellular matrix composed of microfibrils, acid mucopolysaccharides, basement membrane, and collagen fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The morphology of the valve leaflet is not disrupted and the carcinoid plaque generally affects the ventricular aspect of the tricuspid valve leaflets and the arterial aspect of the pulmonic valve cusps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. </p><p>The valves and endocardium of the right side of the heart are most often affected by carcinoid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]; it is postulated that the left-sided valves are spared due to inactivation of humoral substances by the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77192\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77192 \">picture 2</a>). Carcinoid plaques are observed along either endocardial surface of the tricuspid leaflets with alterations ranging from mild disease (stiff thickened leaflets with trivial or mild tricuspid regurgitation) to severe disease (fixed, retracted leaflets with severe tricuspid regurgitation with or without accompanying mild or moderate tricuspid stenosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Carcinoid plaques also commonly affect the pulmonic valve (particularly the arterial aspect) with consequent regurgitation, stenosis, or both. In patients with advanced disease, carcinoid plaque may also involve the endocardial lining of the right heart chambers.</p><p>Left-sided valvular pathology occurs in less than 10 percent of patients with cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is almost always associated with an atrial level right-to-left shunt (as with a patent foramen ovale) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,10</a>]. These conditions permit serotonin-rich blood to enter the left heart chambers without passing through the pulmonary capillaries. The degree of right-to-left shunting may correlate with the degree of valve involvement and associated valve regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Infrequently, left-sided valve disease occurs in patients without a right-to-left shunt with severe, poorly controlled carcinoid syndrome with unusually high levels of circulating serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Carcinoid valve disease affecting the aortic or mitral valve generally manifests as pure regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>An additional rare cardiac complication is metastasis to the heart, identified by echocardiography in 2 (4 percent) of 252 patients with carcinoid syndrome in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a review of 11 such patients, the small bowel was the source of the primary tumor in nine and all had the carcinoid syndrome and hepatic metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Transthoracic echocardiography detected nine tumors &ge;1 cm in size in 5 of 11 patients, revealing a well circumscribed, noninfiltrating, and homogeneous mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of serotonin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence suggests a role for serotonin in the pathogenesis of carcinoid heart disease. Alterations in serotonin metabolism, its associated receptors, and transporter gene have been proposed as likely mechanisms for development of carcinoid related valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It is thought that high circulating serotonin concentration is the major effector of carcinoid heart disease and of the similar valve lesions that may be induced by the ergot-alkaloid derivatives or the anorectic drugs fenfluramine (alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a>) and dexfenfluramine. The data supporting the role of serotonin in the pathogenesis of valve disease are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvular-heart-disease-induced-by-drugs#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvular heart disease induced by drugs&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>In nearly all patients with carcinoid syndrome, tryptophan metabolism is altered so that 70 percent or more of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin, as compared with approximately 1 percent in normal subjects. Serotonin is metabolized to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HIAA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51368 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Tryptophan metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Indirect evidence in support of the role of serotonin in the carcinoid syndrome in humans comes from a study that compared 19 patients with carcinoid heart disease (diagnosed by echocardiography or cardiac catheterization) with 585 carcinoid patients without heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The patients with heart disease had much higher (two- to fourfold) values for serum and plasma serotonin, platelet serotonin, and urinary 5-HIAA excretion. They were also three times as likely to have typical carcinoid symptoms. Similarly, in a report in 23 patients with carcinoid syndrome, urinary 5-HIAA values averaged 356 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in those with heart disease compared with only 99 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in those without cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Urinary 5-HIAA excretion may also predict progression of carcinoid heart disease. In a report from Mayo Clinic, which included 71 patients in whom serial echocardiograms were performed more than one year apart, a &quot;cardiac score&quot; was developed to define the severity of cardiac involvement (including grading scales for tricuspid and pulmonic valve abnormalities as well as right ventricular size and function). Urinary 5-HIAA levels were significantly higher in those with a &gt;25 percent increase in cardiac score than in those with lesser evidence of progression (265 versus 189 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Liver disease, usually due to hepatic metastases, is thought to play a permissive role by allowing large quantities of tumor products such as serotonin to reach the right heart without being inactivated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Rarely, patients with a primary ovarian carcinoid develop carcinoid heart disease in the absence of hepatic metastases because the liver is bypassed by direct venous drainage of the ovary into the inferior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Despite the likely pathogenic link between serotonin and carcinoid heart disease, it is not known if medical therapy to reduce serotonin secretion can prevent the development of cardiac lesions. In an uncontrolled observational series, patients treated with somatostatin analogs, which decrease serotonin secretion, did not prevent or delay valve disease. (See <a href=\"#H277922450\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of carcinoid syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of carcinoid heart disease are often subtle early in the course of the disease. In addition, moderate to severe tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease may be well tolerated for many months. Early symptoms of right-sided valvular heart disease include fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Right-sided heart failure with worsening dyspnea, edema, ascites, and eventual cardiac cachexia occur with progressive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major findings on physical examination include an elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent &quot;v&quot; wave; this is often the earliest clinical finding (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>). Additional clinical features include a palpable right ventricular impulse, and murmurs of tricuspid and pulmonic valve regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Less frequently, a systolic murmur of pulmonary stenosis or a diastolic murmur of tricuspid stenosis is audible. Right-sided cardiac murmurs are accentuated by inspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The auscultatory findings may be subtle, as the murmurs of tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease may be difficult to detect due to the low pressure in the pulmonary circulation. As an example, the murmur of pulmonic regurgitation in the absence of pulmonary hypertension does not have the high-pitched, blowing quality heard with higher pulmonary pressures.</p><p>As the valve disease progresses, the physical features become readily apparent with progressive peripheral edema, ascites, and pulsatile hepatomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aggressive metastatic carcinoid disease with active carcinoid syndrome may cause relatively acute severe tricuspid regurgitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1173306283\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial test findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An electrocardiogram is not required for diagnosis of carcinoid heart disease but is commonly included as a component of the cardiac evaluation. Electrocardiographic findings are nonspecific, with many cases lacking any electrocardiographic abnormalities (eg, 32 percent normal in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]). Nonspecific electrocardiographic findings may include ST-T wave abnormalities, sinus tachycardia, and prolonged PR interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The electrocardiogram in advanced carcinoid heart disease demonstrates low QRS voltage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The cause of the low voltage is not clear but may be related to decreased conduction of the electrical signal to the body surface.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest radiograph is not required for diagnosis of carcinoid heart disease but is commonly included as a component of evaluation of this condition. The chest radiograph is often normal (46 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A common radiographic finding is cardiomegaly with prominence of the right-sided cardiac chambers. Pulmonary congestion, if present, is mild. Pleural effusions and metastatic pleural plaque formation occur late in the course of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4181295101\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H210619414\"><span class=\"h2\">When and how to initially test for carcinoid heart disease</span></p><p><br/> </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3050402022\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with carcinoid syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that all patients with carcinoid syndrome undergo 6 to 12 monthly clinical evaluation for symptoms and signs of valve disease or heart failure and have a serum N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level measured. It is particularly important to screen for carcinoid heart disease in patients with carcinoid syndrome scheduled to undergo liver or abdominal surgery given the risk of hemorrhage following liver or abdominal surgery in patients with carcinoid syndrome with elevated right heart pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Guidelines for screening and diagnosis of carcinoid heart disease are evolving, with differing recommendations in various major society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>After this initial evaluation, echocardiography should be performed in patients with signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of valvular heart disease or heart failure, in patients with NT-proBNP level greater than 260 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (or 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/l)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], as well as in patients who are planned to undergo liver or abdominal intervention. Some experts use a urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) level &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/24</span> h to help identify individuals at risk for carcinoid heart disease. However, we do not use 5-HIAA levels to help identify candidates for echocardiographic screening, since there is evidence that NT-proBNP levels correlate better with carcinoid heart disease severity. (See <a href=\"#H2125259163\" class=\"local\">'Role of biomarkers'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>In addition, a follow-up echocardiogram is recommended in patients who later develop new or worsening signs and symptoms of valve disease or heart failure or elevation of NT-proBNP above 260 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2125259163\"><span class=\"h4\">Role of biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, we suggest annual measurement of serum NT-proBNP levels in all patients with carcinoid syndrome to screen for carcinoid heart disease. This recommendation is based upon studies suggesting that NT-proBNP is a sensitive and specific marker for carcinoid heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Based on two studies, an NT-proBNP level &gt;260 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> has a sensitivity of 69 to 92 percent and specificity of 80 to 91 percent for detection of carcinoid heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. NT-proBNP and plasma 5HIAA levels are both sensitive and specific markers for the presence of carcinoid heart disease, but NT-proBNP correlated moderately with severity of carcinoid heart disease while plasma 5-HIAA correlated only weakly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Urinary levels of 5-HIAA are significantly elevated in patients with carcinoid heart disease, and higher levels are associated with greater risk of progression of carcinoid heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome and tumor localization&quot;, section on 'Urinary excretion of 5-HIAA'</a>.)</p><p>Chromogranin A (CgA) is another potential marker for carcinoid heart disease, but its specificity for detection of severe carcinoid heart disease is low (eg, 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]); we do not recommend its use to screen for carcinoid heart disease. In a study of 102 patients with neuroendocrine tumors, levels of CgA and NT-proBNP were independently associated with carcinoid heart disease and with overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Survival at five years was 81 percent in patients with normal CgA levels, 44 percent in those with elevated CgA but normal NT-proBNP levels, and 16 percent in those with elevations in both CgA and NT-proBNP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3787063847\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with tricuspid and/or pulmonic valve disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired valvular heart disease involving the tricuspid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary valves, in the absence of left-sided valve disease, is uncommon and when detected clinically or echocardiographically should prompt consideration of carcinoid heart disease with clinical cardiovascular evaluation (as described above), clinical evaluation for carcinoid syndrome, and echocardiography.

The major finding on echocardiography is immobility of the pulmonary valve cusps. However, the pulmonary valve cusps may be difficult to visualize by echocardiography due to cusp retraction. Pulmonary annular constriction may also occur resulting in predominant pulmonary outflow tract obstruction.</p><p>The frequency with which these and other findings occur was illustrated in a report in which comprehensive echocardiography was performed in 74 patients with carcinoid heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoid-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
