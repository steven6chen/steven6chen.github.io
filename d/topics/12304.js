These two terms have been replaced with the following classification schema provided in the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/Heart</span> Rhythm Society guidelines on AF management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paroxysmal (ie, self-terminating or intermittent) AF &ndash; Paroxysmal AF is defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within seven days of onset.

Additionally, this classification applies to recurrent episodes of AF that last more than 30 seconds and that are unrelated to a reversible cause. If the AF is secondary to cardiac surgery, pericarditis, myocardial infarction (MI), hyperthyroidism, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary disease, or other reversible causes, therapy is directed toward the underlying disease as well as the AF.

However, there is weak evidence that dietary modifications, such as extra virgin olive oil or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in fish oil, lower the risk. The potential benefit of the latter is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation'</a>.) </p><p>Physical activity and weight loss can significantly reduce AF burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The PREDIMED primary prevention trial found that a Mediterranean diet enriched with either extra virgin olive oil or mixed nuts reduces the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

More severe symptoms include dyspnea at rest, angina, presyncope, or infrequently, syncope. In addition, some patients present with an embolic event or the insidious onset of heart failure (as manifested by pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, weight gain, and ascites). <br/><br/>A semi-quantitative method to classify symptoms has been developed, but the clinical utility of such a system has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitating causes: exercise, emotion, or alcohol. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of the following disease associations: cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or potentially reversible causes (eg, hyperthyroidism, excessive alcohol ingestion).

AF has the following electrocardiographic characteristics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation#H3660804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Common findings'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RR intervals follow no repetitive pattern.

Errors in the diagnosis of AF are especially common with computerized ECG interpretation and in patients who are continuously or intermittently paced. Hence, it is important that the automated ECG interpretation provided by the machine is confirmed by a skilled reader. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Difficulties in diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>A baseline ECG, preferably in sinus rhythm, should also be evaluated for the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markers of nonelectrical cardiac disease, such as left ventricular hypertrophy (possible hypertension) or Q waves (possible coronary artery disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markers of electrical heart disease, including the presence of ventricular pre-excitation or infranodal conduction disease (bundle branch block).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The QT interval (to identify the potential risk of antiarrhythmic therapy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of severe bradycardia or sinus node dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is performed to evaluate the size of the right and left atria and the size and function of the right and left ventricles; to detect possible valvular heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and pericardial disease; and to assess peak right ventricular pressure.</p><p>The TTE may also identify left atrial thrombus, although the sensitivity is low. Transesophageal echocardiography is much more sensitive for identifying thrombi in the left atrium or left atrial appendage and can be used to determine the need for anticoagulation prior to any attempt at pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of echocardiography in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H23782659\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of systemic embolization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional cardiac testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise testing is reasonable for patients with signs or symptoms of ischemic heart disease. It is also useful to help guide pharmacotherapy for AF, as some antiarrhythmic medications are contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease. In addition, stress testing may be helpful in gauging adequacy of heart rate control in AF during exercise. Insufficient heart rate control in AF is a major factor for exercise intolerance in AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations#H523850628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;, section on 'Selecting an antiarrhythmic drug'</a>.)</p><p>Ambulatory cardiac monitoring with event recorders, adhesive extended time event monitors, or implantable loop monitors can be used to identify the arrhythmia if it is intermittent and not captured on routine electrocardiography. Ambulatory ECG monitoring can also be utilized to correlate symptoms to the arrhythmia along with assessment of the AF burden. Twenty-four- to 48-hour Holter monitoring mainly aids in the evaluation of overall ventricular response rates in individuals where a rate control strategy has been chosen and there is concern for inadequate heart rate control or bradycardia.

Care of the former includes decisions regarding the need for anticoagulation and the choice between rate or rhythm control strategies. For patients with established diagnosis, periodic assessment of the adequacy of treatment is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2826689194\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospitalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with AF may require care at an acute care facility or an inpatient unit of a hospital. Common indications for care at one or both of these facilities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of heart failure, hypotension, or difficulty with rate control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of an associated medical problem, which is often the reason for the arrhythmia. Examples include the treatment of hypertension, infection, thyroid storm, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, persistent myocardial ischemia, or acute pericarditis.</p><p/><p>Other indications for hospitalization are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of new onset atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440860093\"><span class=\"h2\">New onset AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with new onset (ie, first detected or diagnosed) AF present with symptoms related to the arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.) Except for embolization, the symptoms associated with new onset AF are primarily due to a rapid ventricular response. Thus, many patients have dramatic improvement in their sense of well-being when the ventricular rate is slowed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of new onset atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Rate control'</a>.)</p><p>There are two broad management issues that must be addressed early in patients with new onset AF: the prevention of systemic embolization and the choice between a rhythm or rate control strategy, both of which may improve symptoms. These issues will be addressed briefly here. More detailed discussions are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23782659\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention of systemic embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every patient with AF should be evaluated for the need of antithrombotic therapy to prevent systemic embolization even for the first AF episode. This is accomplished by use of the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83272 \">table 1</a>). Patients who require antithrombotic therapy include those in whom cardioversion (whether electrically or pharmacologically) to sinus rhythm is being considered (regardless of the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score or method of cardioversion [electrical or pharmacologic]) and those who meet criteria for long-term anticoagulation. All patients whose risk of embolization exceeds the risk of bleeding are candidates for long-term antithrombotic therapy. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Once ventricular rate control is achieved, a decision regarding the long-term management (rhythm versus rate control) of AF should be made. A rhythm control strategy uses either antiarrhythmic drug therapy, percutaneous catheter ablation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a surgical procedure. Electrical cardioversion may be necessary to restore sinus rhythm. Antiarrhythmic medications are generally started before cardioversion and continued to maintain sinus rhythm (in the event of AF recurrence). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Maze procedure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>A rate control strategy generally uses drugs that slow conduction across the atrioventricular (AV) node, such as beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation#H5421069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p><br/>Data suggest that rhythm and rate control strategies are associated with similar rates of mortality and serious morbidity, such as embolic risk. However, there are several reasons why pursuing a rhythm-control strategy would be preferred, including symptom improvement, younger patient age, and irreversible structural and electrical remodeling that can occur with longstanding persistent AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Comparative studies'</a>.) <br/><br/>The decision to adopt a rhythm or rate control strategy is often dictated by the (1) presence of symptoms associated with atrial fibrillation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> (2) development of left ventricular systolic dysfunction thought secondary to the arrhythmia. Some patients with new onset AF who report being asymptomatic may have some subtle symptoms such as fatigue, especially when palpitations are not a prominent component of the presentation.
