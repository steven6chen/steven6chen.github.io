Most clinically used immunosuppressive regimens consist of a combination of several agents used concurrently and the regimen design follows several general principles.</p><p>Immunosuppressive regimens can be classified as induction, maintenance, or anti-rejection. Induction regimens provide intense early postoperative immune suppression while maintenance regimens are used throughout the patient's life to prevent both acute and chronic rejection. This topic will review the induction and maintenance immunosuppressive regimens used in heart transplantation. The management of acute allograft rejection and the diagnosis and allograft vasculopathy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three general principles govern induction and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy regimens. The first principle is that immune reactivity and tendency toward graft rejection are highest early (within the first three to six months) after graft implantation and decrease with time. Thus, most regimens employ the highest intensity of immunosuppression immediately after surgery and decrease the intensity of therapy over the first year, eventually settling on the lowest maintenance levels of immunosuppression that are compatible with preventing graft rejection while minimizing drug toxicities in an individual patient. The second principle is to use low doses of several drugs with non-overlapping toxicities in preference to higher (and more toxic) doses of fewer drugs whenever feasible. The third principle is to avoid over-immunosuppression, because it leads to a myriad of undesirable effects including susceptibility to infection and malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall strategy of deciding whether to use induction therapy and identifying an optimal regimen to achieve a state of early intense immunosuppression remains controversial. Approximately 50 percent of heart transplant programs currently employ a strategy of augmented immunosuppression, or <strong>induction</strong> therapy, during the early postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Several anti-lymphocyte antibodies that target specific epitopes on the surface of both B and T cells have been used as part of induction therapy. </p><p>The goal of induction therapy is to provide intense immunosuppression when the risk of allograft rejection is highest. From a clinical perspective, the main advantages of induction therapy are to allow delayed initiation of nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drugs in patients with compromised renal function prior to or following surgery and to provide some flexibility with respect to early glucocorticoid weaning or use of glucocorticoid-sparing maintenance regimens after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>However, the overall utility of induction is uncertain and data comparing induction protocols are limited. The decreased early rejection observed with induction therapy may be negated by an increase in late rejection after induction therapy is completed and by the potential for increased rates of infection and malignancy associated with such therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. However, patients at highest risk for fatal rejection, including younger patients, African American patients, patients with a high number of HLA mismatches, and patients supported with ventricular assist devices with high levels of pre-formed antibodies, may derive a benefit from induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A Cochrane review included 22 randomized controlled trials investigating the use of T-cell antibody for induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Five trials, with a total of 606 participants, compared any type of induction versus no induction. The remaining trials compared various types of induction regimens against each other. No significant differences were found for any of the comparisons for outcomes of mortality, infection, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, cancer, adverse events, or cardiac allograft vasculopathy. </p><p>In the Cochrane review, the only significant differences found were a reduction in the incidence of acute rejection among patients treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonists compared with no induction and fewer rejection episodes among patients treated with polyclonal antibody induction compared with IL-2 receptor antagonist therapy, though the numbers of events were small so an effect of chance cannot be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin-2 receptor antagonists'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Polyclonal anti-thymocyte antibodies'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Interleukin-2 receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonists for induction therapy has increased, and these drugs are now used in 30 percent of patients undergoing heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The currently available agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a> (Simulect), is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the IL-2 receptor of T lymphocytes, blocks binding of IL-2 to the receptor complex, and exhibits its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting IL-2-mediated T-lymphocyte proliferation. A second IL-2 receptor antagonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a> (Zenapax), was discontinued by the manufacturer in 2009 due to diminishing market demand (and later withdrawn worldwide in response to a <a href=\"http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2018/03/news_detail_002917.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1&amp;token=u/YvHiF//pwa+/g8oLgFqVcpmfNYxP3AJls1hagvCJTisXlajtnwiko5PXZP1TBCmQsDtYo2534lw2peq1w1hryXn6ZitHOXaLTalTtzultgLDdxtnxrTnOoJ5FAUH4HfhA3VLyFctlC3rbQiTG9aHmwRJHp+VmyZNZT/U7mgYY=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3530\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">European Medicine Agency safety announcement</a> noting reports of inflammatory encephalitis and meningoencephalitis among patients treated for multiple sclerosis). Compared with muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) and anti-thymocyte antibodies, this class of drugs has a significantly lower incidence of drug-related adverse reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>The Cochrane review cited above included four trials comparing IL-2 receptor antagonist versus no induction and found no significant difference in outcomes except possibly acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

At six months, the composite incidence of biopsy-detected moderate or severe cellular rejection, hemodynamically significant graft dysfunction, death, re-transplantation, or loss to follow-up was significantly lower in the daclizumab group compared with placebo (36 versus 48 percent), primarily due to a decreased incidence of biopsy-proven rejection. However, among patients receiving daclizumab induction, there was an increased risk of fatal infection when T-cell cytolytic therapy was used concomitantly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyclonal anti-thymocyte antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyclonal antibodies are derived by immunization of horses (ATGAM, also called lymphocyte <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>) or rabbits (Thymoglobulin) with human thymocytes. These agents combined are employed in approximately 20 percent of heart transplant recipients based upon the international transplant registry data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>These preparations contain antibodies directed against a wide variety of human T-cell antigens and cause rapid depletion of T lymphocytes by inducing complement-mediated cytolysis and cell-mediated opsonization in the spleen and liver. There are no head-to-head comparison trials of ATGAM and Thymoglobulin in heart transplantation, but data from the kidney transplant literature suggest that Thymoglobulin may result in a lower incidence of both short- and long-term acute rejection compared with ATGAM, possibly because of more profound and durable lymphopenia after Thymoglobulin administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major acute side effects associated with this class of drugs include a serum sickness reaction characterized by fevers, chills, tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, myalgias, and rash. The reaction is typically noticed during the first or second drug infusion and can be treated by temporarily stopping the drug infusion and restarting at a lower infusion rate. Pre-medication with intravenous glucocorticoids, antihistamines, antipyretics, and H2 blockers can prevent or reduce the severity of symptoms. Dose-dependent leukopenia (30 to 50 percent) and thrombocytopenia (30 to 40 percent) have also been observed and typically respond to dose reduction or drug discontinuation for severe cases (WBC &lt;2,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> or platelet count &lt;50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span>. These agents do not induce a host antibody response to horse or rabbit sera and can be re-used for the treatment of allograft rejection. Long-term side effects include a pre-disposition to opportunistic infections, particularly with cytomegalovirus and a possible increase in the incidence and aggressiveness of post-transplant malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Muromonab-CD3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OKT3 is a murine monoclonal antibody that binds to the T cell receptor-CD3 complex on the surface of circulating T cells. It exerts its immunosuppressive effects via a variety of mechanisms, including rapid T cell depletion from the peripheral circulation as a result of opsonization in the liver and spleen, and modulation of the T cell receptor-CD3 antigen recognition complex, thereby blocking the immunologic function of these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>OKT3 administration is associated with a number of important acute and long-term side effects. The first or second drug dose is typically associated with a <strong>cytokine release syndrome</strong> characterized by fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, chest pain, dyspnea or wheezing, arthralgias, and myalgias. This syndrome is caused by initial activation of T cells and release of multiple cytokines. It can be attenuated by pre-medication with intravenous steroids, antihistamines, antipyretics, and H2-blockers. Rare life-threatening complications have included pulmonary edema, aseptic meningitis, and encephalopathy. Long-term adverse reactions include an increased risk of life-threatening opportunistic infections, particularly with cytomegalovirus and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Finally, prolonged use of OKT3 can elicit a host anti-mouse antibody response that can blunt future drug efficacy and increase the risk of antibody-mediated rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Due to these adverse effects and the availability of alternate agents, OKT3 is no longer used in heart transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Alemtuzumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alemtuzumab</a> (Campath-1H) is a humanized rat monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen expressed on both T and B cells.

Beginning with the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in 1983, significant advances have been made in moving from drugs that provide broad and non-specific immunosuppression to newer agents that provide more targeted immunosuppression through selective inhibition of lymphocyte activation and proliferation. This selectivity has resulted in a marked increase in patient survival due to a decrease in the incidence of both life-threatening opportunistic infections and rejection episodes. Most maintenance immunosuppressive protocols employ a three-drug regimen consisting of a calcineurin-inhibitor (cyclosporine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>), an antimetabolite agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil or less commonly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>), and tapering doses of glucocorticoids over the first year post-transplantation.

These drugs exert their immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting calcineurin, which is normally responsible for the transcription of IL-2 and several other cytokines, including TNF alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma. The end result is blunting of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation in response to alloantigens. The two available calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, form complexes with different intracellular binding proteins, and these drug-protein complexes subsequently bind to and inhibit calcineurin. The drugs differ with respect to both efficacy and side effect profile.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) originally approved the drug in 1995 for use in liver transplantation and later approved it for use in kidney (1997) and heart (2006) transplantation.

As a whole, these trials have shown similar patient survival and a more favorable side effect profile with tacrolimus. For example, the calcineurin-inhibitor associated metabolic derangements appear to be significantly attenuated with tacrolimus use. Patients on tacrolimus, compared with cyclosporine, consistently had less hypertension and less hyperlipidemia.

A common juncture for such changes is when a transplant recipient requires anti-infective therapy.</p><p>A list of the most common and clinically important drug interactions is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78597 \">table 2</a>). Specific interactions of antirejection agents with other medications may be determined using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.</p><p>Drug interactions involving immunosuppressive agents are numerous and medication regimens for transplant recipients are complex. While most drug interactions are not clinically significant and few combinations are absolutely contraindicated, many can create serious consequences in the absence of appropriate monitoring and dose adjustments. Preventable consequences can include organ rejection or acute kidney injury from supratherapeutic levels of calcineurin inhibitors. An evaluation by a clinical pharmacist with transplant expertise may be valuable in some instances.</p><p>One combination involving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> should be <strong>avoided</strong>. Allopurinol inhibits the activity of xanthine oxidase, which is involved in the metabolism of azathioprine, resulting in high levels of the active metabolite 6-mercaptopurine and possible severe bone marrow suppression if the two drugs are used together. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> is an alternative to azathioprine in patients who require allopurinol therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetic drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacokinetic drug interactions occur when a drug changes the immunosuppressive drug blood concentration profile, by interfering with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination of the immunosuppressive agent. Most clinically important pharmacokinetic drug interactions occur due to altered drug metabolism. The calcineurin inhibitors and proliferation signal inhibitors are extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme pathway in the liver so their blood levels are affected by drugs that induce or inhibit this pathway.</p><p>Drugs that <strong>induce</strong> the P-450 3A4 pathway result in enhanced metabolism of the calcineurin inhibitors and proliferation signal inhibitors, thus <strong>lowering</strong> their blood levels and clinical effectiveness. Strong inducers of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 pathway include certain antiepileptic drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>), the antitubercular agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, certain antiretroviral agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>), and the herbal agent St. John's wort.</p><p>Conversely, drugs that <strong>inhibit</strong> the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme pathway result in decreased metabolism of the calcineurin inhibitors and proliferation signal inhibitors, thereby <strong>increasing</strong> their blood levels and potentiating their toxicities. Many drugs inhibit cytochrome P-450 3A4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Common inhibitors include the macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungal agents, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, and several antiretroviral drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacodynamic drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacodynamic drug interactions occur when a drug modulates an immunosuppressive agent's effect at a given blood concentration, either increasing or diminishing the immunosuppressive drug's therapeutic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> toxic effects.
