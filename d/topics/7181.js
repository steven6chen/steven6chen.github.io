When thrombosis leads to total occlusion of blood flow, acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is often the clinical outcome. Patients with acute STEMI should receive coronary reperfusion therapy with either primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis. Reperfusion improves clinical outcomes in nearly all groups of patients with STEMI who present within 12 hours of symptom onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients with acute STEMI, we prefer primary PCI rather than fibrinolysis. However, fibrinolytic therapy, if it can be delivered in a timely manner, should be used if timely primary PCI is not available. Fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) therapy is capable of reestablishing antegrade blood flow in nearly 75 percent of patients, when administered within the first two hours of symptom onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes#H13452783\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;, section on 'Plaque features responsible for acute thrombosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agents in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Markers of efficacy&quot;, section on 'TIMI flow grade'</a>.) </p><p>This topic will discuss the use of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI.

(See <a href=\"#H69243493\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start parenteral anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> rather than another anticoagulant in most patients. We suggest an intravenous bolus of 60 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> (maximum of 4000 units). For the uncommon patient who will not be referred for percutaneous coronary intervention, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> is an alternative. Anticoagulation therapy should be started as soon as the decision for fibrinolysis is made.

(See <a href=\"#H69239859\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We refer most patients for diagnostic angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis. Thus, we consult with a cardiologist soon after initiation of fibrinolysis. (See <a href=\"#H69241007\" class=\"local\">'Management after fibrinolysis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H456381749\" class=\"local\">'Consultation with a cardiologist'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456381709\"><span class=\"h1\">FIBRINOLYSIS VERSUS PRIMARY PCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred to fibrinolytic therapy for most patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). When timely primary PCI is not available, early fibrinolysis should be carried out. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-periprocedural-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Periprocedural management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-versus-fibrinolysis-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention versus fibrinolysis in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Clinical trials&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With regard to primary PCI, randomized trials have consistently shown better outcomes such as mortality and lower rates of recurrent ischemia and major complications such as intracranial hemorrhage. One reason for the superiority of PCI is the high incidence of reocclusion of the infarct-related coronary artery after fibrinolytic therapy. This may be as high as 30 percent at 30 days, is usually silent, and certainly limits the benefits of reperfusion obtained in the very early phase.</p><p>However, due to the high cost associated with developing and implementing cardiovascular intervention centers, their availability varies by country and even by region. Thus, fibrinolysis remains an important reperfusion strategy in many locations. </p><p>If high-quality primary PCI can be delivered within 120 minutes of first medical contact, we prefer it to fibrinolytic therapy for most patients with STEMI. We believe that, ideally, PCI should be performed within 90 minutes from the time of first medical contact. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy#H85815763\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy&quot;, section on 'Primary PCI preferred'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456381749\"><span class=\"h2\">Consultation with a cardiologist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In geographies where fibrinolysis and primary PCI are both available, a cardiologist should be consulted as soon as possible after the diagnosis of STEMI is made. That cardiologist may decide to recommend fibrinolysis based on information suggesting that primary PCI is not immediately available or that the patient is not a candidate for PCI.</p><p>In addition, most patients who receive fibrinolytic therapy are candidates for PCI after treatment with fibrinolytic therapy. Early consultation with a cardiologist may expedite that intervention.

Patients with typical and persistent symptoms in the presence of a new or presumably new left bundle branch block or a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) are also considered eligible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-myocardial-infarction-in-the-presence-of-bundle-branch-block-or-a-paced-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the presence of bundle branch block or a paced rhythm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Acute MI'</a>.)</p><p>All patients who cannot receive primary PCI in a timely manner should be considered for fibrinolytic therapy. All available fibrinolytic agents, compared with placebo, reduce mortality in acute ST elevation MI. The magnitude of the reduction in the risk of death in randomized trials is generally between 15 and 30 percent. The trials supporting this conclusion are described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agents and clinical trials in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefit from fibrinolytic therapy declines rapidly as the time from onset of symptoms to therapy increases beyond three hours. After 12 hours, the benefit may not exceed the risk. Thus, in geographies where primary PCI is available, PCI becomes a more logical choice as the time from onset of chest pain increases. (See <a href=\"#H69239847\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> below.)</p><p>Our specific recommendations for choosing between these two reperfusion modalities are found elsewhere.

The infarct-related artery in these patients was more likely to be a native coronary artery than a bypass graft (62 versus 38 percent).
