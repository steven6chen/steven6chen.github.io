This issue was addressed using high-resolution MRI to assess aortic and carotid artery plaques. No changes were seen at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], but progressive regression was noted at 12 and 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The earliest change, seen at 12 months, was a reduction in plaque size followed by an increase in luminal area due to arterial remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Plaque stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary artery plaque rupture is a central component in most patients with an acute coronary syndrome. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that many of these patients have multiple unstable plaques in different coronary arteries, suggesting widespread inflammation in the coronary circulation. Thus, intervention aimed only at the culprit lesion is not likely to be optimal and the ability of statins to induce plaque stabilization may be an important mechanism of benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Animal models and human studies have shown that statin therapy can reduce the rate of progression of plaque development and stabilize atherosclerotic plaques that have ruptured as well as those that are vulnerable to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/13,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19-21</a>].

Compared to placebo, atorvastatin reduced the progression of mean plaque volume or thickness (1.2 versus 9.6 mm<sup>3</sup> for placebo) and increased the hyperechogenicity of the plaque, indicating a change in plaque composition (from lipid-rich to fibrotic and calcified) that corresponds to increased plaque stability and a reduced tendency for rupture.</p><p>A variety of factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of plaque rupture and the induction of acute coronary syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of the vulnerable plaque&quot;</a>.) One important effect of statin therapy may be maintenance of integrity of the fibrous cap of the plaque, thereby protecting against plaque rupture. This effect appears to be mediated by inhibition of macrophage proliferation, reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue factor (which promotes thrombus formation) by macrophages, and an increase in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/20,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inhibitory effect on MMPs may be mediated in part by statin-induced inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

This effect was fully reversed by mevalonate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In animal models, certain statins induce smooth muscle cell apoptosis.

It is likely that these effects are in part due to lipid lowering. In animal models, reductions in macrophage content, MMP, and tissue factor expression can be induced by dietary modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Additional support for the importance of lipid lowering comes from examination of the coronary arteries and plaque morphology of 113 men who died suddenly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Elevated serum markers of inflammation, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP), are associated with progression of atherosclerosis, predict the risk of a first myocardial infarction among apparently healthy men, and are associated with a worse prognosis among patients with stable and unstable angina and those who undergo coronary stenting.
