Inflammation is characterized histologically by the accumulation of leukocytes in the affected tissue due to migration of circulating leukocytes out of the vasculature, a process which is actively mediated and precisely controlled by leukocytes, the cytokines they produce, and the vascular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, excessive or uncontrolled inflammatory responses can lead to the pathologic inflammation seen in many rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders.</p><p>Leukocyte trafficking from the bloodstream into tissue is important for surveillance of foreign antigens and for rapid leukocyte accumulation at a site of inflammatory response or tissue injury. Although the importance of leukocyte movement toward sites of inflammation was well-recognized more than a century ago, the precise molecular mechanisms for leukocyte interactions with the endothelium and the emigration of these cells through the endothelium were elucidated only decades later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The process of leukocyte-endothelial adhesion during inflammation and the various adhesion molecules involved will be discussed in this topic review. Defects and deficiencies in adhesion molecules are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion requires dynamic interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, involving multiple steps. These steps must be precisely orchestrated to ensure a rapid response with only minimal damage to healthy tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Interactions between leukocytes and the endothelium are mediated by several families of adhesion molecules, each of which participates in a different phase of the process. The surface expression and activation of these molecules during an inflammatory response is tightly controlled under normal conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ADHESION MOLECULES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three families of adhesion molecules are of particular importance to the process of leukocyte-endothelial adhesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71824 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selectins</strong> &ndash; Selectins primarily mediate cellular margination and slow rolling. They are located on both leukocytes and endothelial cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Integrins</strong> &ndash; Integrins are located on leukocytes and are involved in rolling, but they are most important for arrest on the vascular endothelium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins</strong> &ndash; These molecules are important for firm adhesion and transmigration and are largely expressed on endothelial cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Selectins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selectins are type I transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on both leukocytes and endothelial cells. The genes for the various members of this family are closely linked on chromosome 1, reflecting their common evolutionary origin. Three selectins exist, including E-, P-, and L-selectin, named for the cell type in which they were originally identified (ie, endothelium, platelet, and leukocyte). All three selectins share similar structural features and an N-terminal lectin-like domain that is crucial for ligand binding. The lectin-like domain is followed by an epidermal growth factor-like domain, a variable number of consensus repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69633\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69633 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>P-selectin</strong> &ndash; P-selectin (also called cluster of differentiation molecule 62P or CD62P) is involved in early leukocyte recruitment during the inflammatory response. It is constitutively expressed and stored in secretory granules within endothelial cells. Once the endothelium is stimulated by inflammatory mediators, these granules fuse with the plasma membrane, increasing surface expression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>E-selectin</strong> &ndash; E-selectin (CD62E) is synthesized de novo and expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes after stimulation by various inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), endotoxin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Its importance had been illustrated in one patient with a defect in E-selectin production and expression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;, section on 'Abnormal E-selectin expression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>L-selectin</strong> &ndash; L-selectin (CD62L) is only expressed on leukocytes, unlike the other two selectins. It was originally discovered as a homing molecule that allowed lymphocytes to enter lymphoid tissue. This selectin is unique in that it mediates lymphocyte recruitment on high endothelial venues in lymphatic tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Selectin ligands</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selectins bind to specialized fucosylated sialoglycoconjugates, such as sialyl Lewis X, which decorate selected surface glycoproteins. A well-characterized example is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), which is expressed as a dimer on most leukocytes and can interact with all three selectins under inflammatory situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The importance of fucosylation is demonstrated by the human genetic disease leukocyte-adhesion deficiency II (LAD II), which is due to a mutation in the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-fucose specific transporter. Defective fucosylation results in an absence of selectin ligands and inability of leukocytes to initiate the adhesion process. Clinically, this disease is characterized by recurrent infections and intellectual disability (mental retardation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;, section on 'LAD II'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Integrins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integrins are largely responsible for adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. Integrins are composed of heterodimers of covalently-associated alpha and beta protein chains. Individual integrins are categorized and named according to the specific alpha and beta chains present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54103\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54103 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Certain members of the beta-1 and beta-2 subclasses of integrins are primarily responsible for the migration of leukocytes into areas of inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta-1 integrins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes express the beta-1 integrin, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4). This molecule binds to endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily protein) and is critical for the accumulation of these cell types at sites of chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta-2 integrins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The beta-2 leukocyte integrins all share a common beta-2 subunit (CD18) and differ in their alpha chains (CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c). The three beta-2 integrins are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD11a/CD18b)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrophage antigen-1 (Mac-1, CR3, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD11b/CD18b)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">150/95</span> (gp <span class=\"nowrap\">150/95,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">CD11c/CD18b)</span></p><p/><p>All three of these integrins are expressed constitutively and must be &quot;activated&quot; in order to become adhesive for their ligands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Leukocyte activation and arrest'</a> below.)</p><p>The importance of the beta-2 integrins is illustrated in a rare condition called LAD I, which is mentioned briefly here and discussed in detail elsewhere. LAD I results from mutations in the gene encoding the beta-2 (CD18) subunit, resulting in deficiencies in the three integrins containing CD18 and impaired migration of leukocytes into sites of inflammation.</p><p>The main clinical features of LAD I are delayed separation of the umbilical cord, recurrent severe infection without pus formation, defective wound healing, and marked leukocytosis (neutrophilia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;, section on 'LAD I'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoglobulin superfamily molecules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin superfamily molecules expressed on endothelial cells interact with integrins on leukocytes and are involved in firm adhesion and transmigration. The molecules of this family that are important in leukocyte-endothelial adhesion are intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2), and VCAM-1. Variable numbers of these molecules are expressed on the surface of the endothelial cells both constitutively and after cellular activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>No human disease with congenital defects in the immunoglobulin superfamily molecules has been described. VCAM-1 deletion is lethal in the mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and this may also be the case in humans.</p><p>The defining structural characteristic of the immunoglobulin superfamily of molecules is a variable number of intramolecular loops linked by disulfide bonds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76749 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed at low levels on endothelial cells.

It is not expressed on resting endothelial cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1 or CD31) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is expressed at low levels on most leukocytes and platelets but at high levels in endothelial cells where it is localized to intercellular junctions. PECAM-1 is involved in phagocyte transendothelial migration, primarily in migration through the subendothelial basement membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">THE ADHESION CASCADE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under normal conditions, leukocytes move rapidly in the vasculature, carried along in the laminar flow of blood. The movement of leukocytes from the bloodstream to the tissue occurs in several distinct steps. A simplified version of this process is described in this review (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73528 \">figure 4</a>). First, under conditions of flow, loose adhesion to the vessel wall causes leukocyte rolling on the endothelium, which primarily occurs in postcapillary venules. This transient and reversible step is a prerequisite for activation of leukocytes. Arrest and firm adhesion occur next, followed by transmigration across the vascular endothelium. Each of these steps involves different adhesion molecules and can be differentially regulated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Rolling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In response to local inflammatory stimuli, endothelial cells become activated and dramatically increase surface expression of selectins. Selectins interact with carbohydrate ligands on the surface of leukocytes. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), enriched at the very tip of leukocyte microvilli, plays a major role in this initial interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Selectin ligands'</a> above.)</p><p>The interaction of selectins on endothelial cells with their ligands on leukocytes results in slow rolling of leukocytes along vessel walls adjacent to the site of injury. The process of rolling is dependent upon flow. Rolling cells will detach if flow is interrupted because the strength of binding of platelet (P)- and leukocyte (L)-selectin to their ligands is enhanced by shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Neutrophil rolling is primarily mediated by L-selectin on neutrophils and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Binding to the selectins tethers the leukocytes, exposing them to chemokines and other stimuli in the microenvironment. No firm adhesion occurs at this very early stage of the cascade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukocyte activation and arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slow rolling allows leukocytes to sample the chemokines being synthesized in the local microenvironment. Rolling is reversible until integrins on the leukocytes become sufficiently activated. Chemokines and their receptors provide the activation signals for integrins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Activated integrins on the leukocyte surface then mediate arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>All chemokine receptors signal through heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Binding of a chemokine to its GPCR triggers a complex intracellular signaling network within milliseconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63985\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63985 \">figure 5</a>). Rap-1 (repressor activator protein-1), one of these signaling molecules, has emerged as a key regulator of integrin activation. It transmits regulatory signals to the cell surface that induce conformational changes in integrin molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, control of integrin function occurs via signals that originate within the cell cytoplasm in response to changes in the cell's status, a process called &quot;inside-out signaling.&quot;</p><p>In response to activation signals, surface integrins undergo a dramatic transition from a bent low-affinity conformation into a fully extended high-affinity structure, with separation of the alpha and beta subunit cytoplasmic tails and opening of the ligand binding site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63985\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63985 \">figure 5</a>). This process is called affinity regulation. Kindlin-3 (a signaling protein) and talin-1 (an actin-binding protein) also play a major role in integrin activation and affinity upregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Kindlin-3 binds to the intracellular portions of beta-1, -2, and -3 integrins and is believed to enhance their binding to talin-1 at the cell membrane, which leads to increased integrin affinity. Thus, talin-1 and kindlin-3 are critical coactivators and have distinct roles in the induction of integrin conformational rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In addition to affinity regulation, the overall strength of adhesiveness (avidity) of the leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction is further increased by the clustering of the integrin molecules on the leukocyte surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These changes are important for leukocyte arrest.</p><p>Activation of leukocyte integrins results in their increased binding to immunoglobulin superfamily molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells. This ensures that adhesion is firm enough to withstand the continuous shear forces present within the blood vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Defects in integrin activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defective integrin activation underlies the rare disorder, leukocyte-adhesion deficiency III (LAD III). This disease arises from a general defect in the activation of all integrins due to mutations in kindlin-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. All patients identified had mutations in kindlin-3, although it is possible that in the future, mutations in other genes involved in integrin activation will be discovered. LAD III is characterized by severe infections, as well as a bleeding tendency due to a defect in beta-3 activation, which is important in platelet aggregation.</p><p>Knockout mice models of various cytoplasmic adaptors for integrin activation, such as diacylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (CalDAG-GEF1) and kindlin-3, have been very helpful to understanding the role of these molecules. A knockout of talin, which is important in many other cellular functions, was found to be lethal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;, section on 'LAD III'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Crawling and transmigration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmigration through venular walls is the final step in the process of leukocyte emigration into tissue. Emigration takes place mainly at junctions between endothelial cells (paracellular transmigration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and a leukocyte temporarily arrested at a location distant from a junction site must &quot;crawl&quot; to one nearby while resisting detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Specific molecules, such as platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), are located at these junction sites and actively mediate leukocyte transendothelial migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A small fraction of leukocytes follow a different route through the endothelial cell layer, passing directly through endothelial cells via membrane-associated passageways, a process called transcellular emigration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The same families of adhesion molecules may be involved in this form of emigration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], although the mechanisms have not been extensively studied.</p><p>Leukocytes leaving the vasculature must traverse the endothelial cell layer, the underlying basement membrane, and a loose network of pericytes. Pericytes are long cells composed largely of smooth muscle elements that are wrapped discontinuously around endothelial cells in postcapillary venules. A leukocyte requires approximately 2 to 5 minutes to traverse the endothelial cell layer and 5 to 15 minutes to pass through the basement membrane. Passage through pericytes varies in duration, depending upon the density of these cells in different tissue types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many human disorders, excessive inflammation plays a pathogenic role. Several well-established anti-inflammatory therapies act, in part, by interfering with the adhesion cascade, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].

PML is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is caused by reactivation of the polyomavirus JC (JC virus).

These molecules are normally expressed and activated in a precisely controlled manner. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important adhesion molecules include selectins, integrins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Adhesion molecules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The movement of leukocytes from the bloodstream into sites of inflammation may be divided into specific steps: rolling on the endothelium, leukocyte activation and arrest, and transmigration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F73528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73528 \">figure 4</a>). Each of these steps involves different adhesion molecules. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'The adhesion cascade'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several well-established anti-inflammatory agents act, in part, by inhibiting the expression of adhesion molecules, such as glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Novel agents are in development, although the beneficial therapeutic effects must be balanced against negative consequences, such as increased susceptibility to infection.
