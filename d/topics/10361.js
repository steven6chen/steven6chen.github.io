In the past, brain metastases almost invariably contributed to the patients' death. However, major advances in neuroimaging, improved options for the neurosurgical and radiotherapeutic management of brain metastases, improved management of metastatic disease at systemic sites, and demonstrated activity of systemic treatments against central nervous system metastases have substantially improved the prognosis for many patients.</p><p>The management of patients with melanoma and brain metastases will be reviewed here. General aspects of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of cancer-related brain metastases are discussed separately.

In the United States, only lung and breast cancers are more frequent primary sites associated with brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for melanoma, brain metastases are separated from other sites of metastasis and form a separate M category, M1d (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Patients with melanoma limited to the skin and without lymph node involvement (stage I, II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 \">table 2</a>)) have a low incidence of brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], although younger patients with thick primaries may have an increased risk of late central nervous system (CNS) failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In patients who presented with advanced regional melanoma (stage IIIB and C), a retrospective analysis of data from the large multi-institutional S0008 adjuvant trial observed a 15 percent incidence of subsequent brain metastases, which occurred predominantly in the first three years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The risk of brain metastases in advanced melanoma increases with disease duration. In patients with metastatic disease but without brain involvement, a phase III trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> found that 20 to 30 percent of patients had brain metastases detected by one year and 30 to 40 percent by three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Eighty percent of melanoma brain metastases are supratentorial, while 15 percent are infratentorial or leptomeningeal, and 5 percent are located in the brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Common symptoms include headache, neurologic deficits, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizures. In addition, brain metastases have a high propensity for spontaneous hemorrhage. Patients who present with larger, symptomatic metastases are at higher risk for deteriorating performance status and worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

This observation provides a rationale for the early detection and treatment of asymptomatic brain metastases, although there are no direct data that periodic screening leads to better functional outcome or survival.</p><p>In general, the diagnosis of brain metastases should not be based upon neuroimaging findings alone, particularly for patients with a single lesion in the absence of other systemic metastatic disease or when no diagnosis has been previously established. When a gross total resection is unlikely to be achieved in this situation, consideration should be made for a limited biopsy to establish a diagnosis.</p><p>Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients who present with clinical regionally involved (stage III) disease and for those with metastatic (stage IV) disease, as well as for those with specific signs or symptoms, although there are no recommendations regarding subsequent rescreening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The available evidence suggests that MRI with gadolinium contrast is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) for detecting brain lesions, although contrast-enhanced CT is an alternative if MRI is not possible. MRI frequently identifies asymptomatic small brain metastases.

In analyses of over 1400 patients diagnosed in the 1980s and 1990s, the median survival was three to four months, the one-year survival rate was 9 to 19 percent, and only rare patients had prolonged survival.</p><p>However, the contemporary use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and systemic therapy (checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> targeted therapy) to control both brain metastases and other metastatic sites has resulted in a dramatic improvement in prognosis. As an example, in a series of 179 consecutive cases of patients treated with SRS for brain metastases followed by either immunotherapy or targeted therapy, the median overall survival was 11 months, and the one- and two-year overall survival rates were 50 and 27 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Favorable prognostic signs included the delayed onset of a single brain metastasis without other visceral metastatic disease and a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], or an initial presentation with an unknown primary presenting as a solitary melanoma brain metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, multiple brain lesions, extensive visceral metastases, high serum LDH, or a primary lesion of the head and neck region historically carried an unfavorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/9,10,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,21-23</a>].</p><p>A variety of tools were developed for prognostic purposes in individual patients.

The general approach to melanoma brain metastases is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113993\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113993 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Advances in neurosurgical techniques and radiation therapy (RT), especially stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), have led to a major improvement in the ability to control brain metastases, and systemic therapy (immunotherapy, targeted therapy) has dramatically prolonged overall survival in patients with disseminated cutaneous melanoma at extracranial sites. Although the CNS has been considered a sanctuary site that does not respond to systemic therapy, newer data suggest that this is not always the case, and systemic therapy is becoming a potential component of the treatment of brain metastases. (See <a href=\"#H671137671\" class=\"local\">'Neurosurgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H671137734\" class=\"local\">'Stereotactic radiosurgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H314106084\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prolonged survival and durable remissions in some patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma raise important issues concerning complications of therapy, which need to be considered in planning a therapeutic approach. Because of this, a multidisciplinary approach that considers all available treatment modalities is essential for the proper treatment of the patient with brain metastases. </p><p>Important factors that need to be considered in planning a comprehensive treatment approach for patients with melanoma brain metastases include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number, size, and location of brain metastases, as well as the extent of CNS symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of systemic metastatic disease and the history of prior therapy for systemic metastases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall performance status, age, and presence of other comorbidities </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>BRAF</em> mutation status of the melanoma</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135228678\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic small brain metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a single or limited number of relatively small asymptomatic brain metastases, progression of extracranial disease may pose the most important threat to quality and duration of life. In this situation, rapid initiation of systemic therapy is important and needs to be integrated with treatment directed specifically at the brain metastases.</p><p>Surgery may be important in the uncommon patient whose only manifestation of metastatic disease is a lesion in the brain. Surgical resection of an isolated metastasis may also be an important component of initial management for larger asymptomatic lesions where there is concern about early progression of the brain metastasis. SRS may be an alternative to neurosurgical resection, particularly in cases where the lesion is not surgically accessible or where the patient's overall condition precludes surgery.</p><p>For patients with multiple brain metastases, a limited intracranial tumor burden, good performance status, and relatively favorable life expectancy, SRS alone has been the preferred treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. The use of SRS was thought to minimize the risk of late neurocognitive deficits compared with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). However, radiation necrosis may be an increasing issue even with SRS, particularly in patients receiving systemic therapy, due to the longer survival associated with the improved systemic disease control being achieved with immunotherapy and targeted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>The roles of systemic immunotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with asymptomatic brain metastases are evolving. Although long-term data are not available and additional studies are in progress, systemic therapy without surgical resection or RT may be an alternative for carefully selected patients with small brain lesions, particularly when there is a significant burden of extracranial disease. In this situation, careful monitoring with frequent imaging is mandatory, with prompt initiation of surgery or RT if there is evidence of CNS progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3561503354\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic or large brain metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a symptomatic brain metastasis or with multiple brain metastases, control of CNS lesions is a high priority, since progression of brain metastases can lead to rapid functional deterioration, impaired quality of life, or death. However, lengthy delays in initiating systemic therapy, due to recovery from neurosurgery or long courses of RT, may result in substantial systemic disease progression with serious consequences. </p><p>Prior to the development of effective systemic therapy, control of brain metastases utilized neurosurgical resection for a single large lesion, when feasible, along with postoperative RT to prevent relapses. Surgery remains the preferred approach for solitary large (&gt;3 cm) tumors, metastases in the posterior fossa that cause significant effacement of the fourth ventricle or cerebral aqueduct, and lesions surrounded by significant edema. For the appropriately selected patient, surgical resection continues to be the best means to provide local control of CNS disease.</p><p>Postoperative single-fraction SRS, hypofractionated RT, or fractionated RT to the resection bed is often used as an adjunct to neurosurgery to minimize the risk of local recurrence. However, in the current era of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the role of postoperative RT to the resection bed is controversial. </p><p>The data supporting the use of SRS following surgical resection of brain metastases were derived from trials prior to the development of more effective systemic therapy, and concerns about the late development of radiation necrosis have called the role of SRS into question. Newer systemic agents have substantially increased life expectancy due to the ability to control extracranial disease, and many are associated with CNS responses.</p><p>For patients who are not candidates for surgical resection, RT alone, usually in the form of single-fraction SRS or hypofractionated courses, has become an effective alternative to surgical resection. For patients with a large number of metastases, WBRT was originally used in this setting. However, given the poor historical survival and neurocognitive outcomes after WBRT, more-targeted radiation approaches are being used more extensively. Carefully selected patients with multiple lesions may be successfully managed with single-fraction SRS or hypofractionated courses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/28,29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,32</a>].</p><p>There are no substantive data on the role of systemic therapy in the treatment of large or symptomatic brain metastases, or on the optimal timing for integration of systemic therapy with neurosurgery or SRS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2207751298\"><span class=\"h2\">Leptomeningeal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis is particularly poor for melanoma patients with leptomeningeal disease. Both craniospinal irradiation and intrathecal chemotherapy are occasionally used in an effort to palliate symptoms, but benefits are limited, since neither are felt to offer durable control.

SRS employs multiple convergent radiation beams to deliver a high radiation dose to a radiographically discrete treatment volume. SRS allows higher doses of radiation to be delivered to a target lesion with decreased normal tissue injury, due to the rapid drop-off in the radiation dose at the margins of the treatment field.

This approach resulted in a high rate of control of the treated lesion, with a suggestion of improved survival.

For example, temozolomide treatment of 151 patients with brain metastases (117 were previously untreated) led to eight objective responses (one complete and seven partial) and 34 (29 percent) patients with stable CNS disease in the previously untreated cohort.

The approach to patients with melanoma brain metastases is rapidly evolving and should be distinguished from the current approach for patients with other types of central nervous system (CNS) metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-brain-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of brain metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historically, control of CNS lesions was considered the initial priority. Systemic therapy utilizing advances in immunotherapy and targeted therapy has dramatically improved the prognosis for patients with metastatic melanoma. These systemic agents have activity at all sites of disease, including the brain, and the CNS can be considered another site of metastatic disease. The long survival of patients receiving immunotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> targeted therapy has led to approaches to minimize the long-term impact of radiation therapy. These systemic therapy approaches need to be integrated into a multidisciplinary management plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113993\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113993 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2095280327\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary approach'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For good performance status patients with a relatively favorable life expectancy, we suggest systemic therapy. The choice of immunotherapy or targeted therapy needs to be addressed after consideration of prior systemic therapy, the extent of intracranial disease, and the patient's perceived ability to tolerate various therapeutic options. In this setting, the optimal timing and integration of systemic therapy with treatment targeting brain metastases is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific therapy directed against brain metastases needs to consider the number and location of lesions, as well as the overall condition of the patient:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with one or a very limited number of surgically accessible metastases in a non-eloquent region that is symptomatic or requires tissue confirmation, we suggest surgical resection rather than stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the metastases. Surgery can also be considered to relieve symptoms from larger (&gt;3 cm) lesions that are unlikely to respond to radiation therapy (RT), are producing symptomatic edema, or are threatening to herniate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Postoperative SRS, hypofractionated RT, or fractionated RT can be considered for patients who have undergone surgical resection, since this decreases the risk of CNS relapse. However, this approach may be associated with late severe cognitive impairment or radionecrosis in patients with prolonged overall survival because of control of systemic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with multiple small lesions that are asymptomatic or are not surgically accessible, we recommend SRS rather than whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Such treatment should be combined with systemic therapy to control extracranial disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients whose brain metastases have been treated with SRS, we suggest observation with surveillance rather than adjuvant WBRT because of concerns of late neurocognitive effects and the lack of survival benefit with inclusion of WBRT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1961238757\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a small, asymptomatic, solitary or a limited number of brain metastases along with significant extracranial metastatic disease burden, systemic therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>, or a <em>BRAF </em>inhibitor plus a MEK inhibitor if the tumor contains a <em>BRAF</em> mutation) may be considered instead of surgical resection or SRS as the initial treatment for CNS disease. However, such patients require very careful monitoring for early detection of any progression of CNS disease. (See <a href=\"#H314106084\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a short life expectancy, in whom systemic therapy options are no longer likely to offer substantial benefit, and a large intracranial tumor burden, WBRT may be considered. In some cases, early discussion of hospice is appropriate when prognosis and quality of life are dismal. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103791136\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Marc Friedberg, MD, PhD, and Eric Wong, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Johnson JD, Young B.
