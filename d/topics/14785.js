(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The average size of these RCCs at presentation is decreasing, and more patients are presenting with small, localized lesions. In addition, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of preserving renal function, if this can be accomplished without compromising the oncologic outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H387391471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Partial nephrectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Sharply delineated areas of very high or low temperature can be created in a minimally invasive fashion with either radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, or microwave ablation. These temperature extremes are used to produce tumor cell death. Emerging technologies, such as non-thermal irreversible electroporation (IRE) can also induce cell death and are in early clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These minimally invasive technologies are rapidly gaining acceptance in selected patients as alternatives to surgery for many tumors, including RCC.</p><p>The increasing acceptance of RFA and cryoablation for kidney tumors is based upon favorable outcomes in initial studies, a low incidence of serious complications, less immediate morbidity than with surgery, lower cost, and the ability to treat patients in the outpatient setting. Optimal application of these ablative techniques requires interventional radiologists and urologists who are experienced and skilled in the application of the technology.</p><p>The potential benefits of these ablative techniques must be balanced against the limited long-term comparative efficacy data. In addition, multiple treatment sessions may be required because of difficulties in monitoring the extent of ablation, particularly for tumors greater than 4 cm in diameter. Furthermore, these ablative techniques may not be appropriate for large lesions or tumors near the renal hilum.</p><p>The various ablative techniques, indications, and outcomes for patients with RCC are reviewed here. The surgical management of RCC is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have not been definitively established.</p><p>Factors that can lead to consideration of an ablative approach rather than surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small, incidentally detected RCC (ideally &lt;4 cm in diameter and limited to the kidney). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, and management of a small renal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient who is considered a poor surgical candidate, based upon older age or significant comorbidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need for nephron-sparing treatment as a way to postpone or avoid the need for chronic dialysis. This includes patients with chronic renal insufficiency, a single kidney, bilateral RCCs, or a genetic predisposition to multiple tumors (eg, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-kidney-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary kidney cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>For patients with one or more of these factors, RFA or cryoablation may be an attractive option since ablation may avoid the morbidity of surgery while offering an effective and potentially curative treatment option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tumor ablation may have an initial advantage over surgery for small RCC treatment because of the lower costs; however, more frequent imaging is required after ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In addition to the application of these techniques for small RCCs, RFA and cryoablation may be useful in some patients with local tumor recurrence after nephrectomy, intractable tumor-related hematuria, tumor debulking in patients with metastatic disease, or in the management of symptomatic distant metastases from a primary kidney tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are usually evaluated by both a urologist and a radiologist prior to treatment. Imaging is used to define the extent of disease and the presence or absence of metastases. In addition, treatment planning requires pretreatment imaging that can be performed with ultrasound, magnetic resonance (MR), or computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A pretreatment biopsy should always be performed, as imaging does not accurately differentiate benign from malignant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, systemic treatments for patients with advanced RCC are increasingly being based on tumor histology and other pathologic features.</p><p>Tumor size and location are the most important factors that govern whether RCCs can be successfully treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In determining the volume to be treated, a 0.5 to 1.0 cm &quot;ablation margin&quot; surrounding the tumor is needed to ensure that the entire tumor is treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Since temperature gradients exponentially decrease with distance from the radiofrequency or cryoablation probe, large tumors pose a significant challenge. In general, tumors &lt;4 cm in diameter are ideal. Most tumors &lt;3 cm can be treated in a single session. Tumors between 3.0 and 4.0 cm in diameter can also be successfully treated, although multiple ablations may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exophytic tumors are most amenable to ablation, since these are surrounded by heat-insulating perirenal fat with relatively little vascular tissue, which can draw heat away from tumor (&quot;heat-sink&quot; effect). As a result, large exophytic tumors as large as 4 cm are almost always successfully treated, with 70 percent or more requiring only a single session. Parenchymal tumors may be more difficult to treat. Centrally located tumors are the hardest to successfully ablate due to the heat-sink effect and have an increased risk of treatment failure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relative contraindications to RFA or cryoablation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A life expectancy less than one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of distant metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors &gt;5 cm or tumors in the hilum or central collecting system are generally not candidates for ablation. For tumors in which treatment may cause thermal injury to the proximal ureter (resulting in urine extravasation and urinoma), an intraureteral stent is usually inserted prior to treatment.</p><p/><p>Absolute contraindications include irreversible coagulopathies or severe medical instability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6188843\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of ablative technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operator experience and comfort with any given technique is one of the most important determinants for achieving a good outcome, with many interventional radiologists preferring RFA and many urologists preferring cryoablation, based upon local familiarity with a given technique.</p><p>Both cryoablation and RFA demonstrate very high efficacy with limited complications, which has made a direct comparison challenging. It is doubtful that a proper clinical trial will be performed in the near future, since the number of patients needed to demonstrate a significant difference is too high to be feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Preliminary outcomes for microwave have started to accumulate, with this modality also demonstrating high efficacy, but further evaluation and follow-up is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Until then, the choice of microwave technology is also based upon operator comfort and experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful percutaneous tumor ablation requires killing all viable malignant cells including a 5 to 10 mm &quot;ablative&quot; margin of surrounding tissue, while minimizing damage to adjacent normal kidney. The most extensively used techniques are radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation. Other techniques using alternative energy sources (microwave, high-intensity focused ultrasound) show some promise but are available only in experimental settings.</p><p>Both RFA and cryoablation typically are performed with a percutaneous approach. When done percutaneously, either technique is usually an outpatient procedure unless comorbid conditions require hospitalization or closer observation. Only conscious sedation is typically necessary for anesthesia, although some clinicians and patients prefer general anesthesia.</p><p>The patient is placed prone. After local anesthesia is applied, the applicator is percutaneously advanced into the center of the tumor under computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Heat or cold is then applied for approximately 10 to 20 minutes as dictated by the device maker's recommendations. Depending upon the size and location of the tumor, the applicator may need to be readjusted, and additional treatments administered.</p><p>After the procedure, the patient is monitored for several hours, and discharged home with oral analgesics for post-procedural pain. Patients usually are able to resume full activity within a couple of days.</p><p>A laparoscopic approach is similar to other surgical laparoscopic procedures requiring general anesthesia, and image guidance is limited to small transducer ultrasonography. Most patients treated laparoscopically are hospitalized overnight, and there may be more post-procedural pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The choice of laparoscopic versus percutaneous approach is based mostly upon the local expertise. Laparoscopic ablation is typically performed by urologists, while percutaneous tumor ablation is typically performed by interventional radiologists. Therefore, local referral and practice pattern usually dictate the chosen approach. Technically, tumors within a posterior location, that is, closer to the back, are more challenging to treat laparoscopically than anterior lesions, and therefore some centers prefer to treat these lesions percutaneously. No randomized controlled comparison of the approaches has been performed, and retrospective comparative data have yielded inconclusive and sometimes mixed conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiofrequency ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RFA utilizes a high-frequency (460 to 500 kHz) alternating current that is delivered into the tumor through a thin needle (usually 21- to 14-gauge) that is electrically insulated except for its terminal 1 to 3 cm. The current produces resistive friction in the tissue that is converted into heat, analogous to heat production from an electrical resister in a circuit. Heat, in turn, causes cellular destruction and protein denaturation. Most RFA systems used for the kidney are monopolar, and the current is completed with grounding pads placed on the patient's back and thighs.</p><p>Efforts to increase tumor ablation have led to the development of various RF applicators, such as multi-tined applicators, cluster applicators, and pulsed energy delivery. There are multiple RFA devices available for soft tumor ablation. There is no demonstrated advantage of any one device.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryoablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For cryoablation, liquid nitrogen or argon is introduced into a probe in a controlled fashion, resulting in freezing of the surrounding tissues, with the formation of an &quot;iceball&quot; that can be visualized. Intracellular ice crystals disrupt the cell membrane and other intracellular activities, leading to cell death. Cells that are not directly killed may undergo apoptosis.</p><p>A typical cryoablation session involves freezing, thawing, and refreezing, which is particularly effective at mediating cellular disruption. The applicators initially developed for cryoablation were relatively large, and laparoscopy was required. Smaller applicators are now available, enabling percutaneous image-guided cryoablation.</p><p>During cryoablation, the iceball can be visualized in real time with either CT or MRI, which allows the extent of cell death to be more reliably predicted. Complete cell death is thought to occur 3 mm inside the edge of the ice ball; thus, most operators extend the ice ball at least 5 mm beyond the tumor margin to ensure complete tumor coverage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6188899\"><span class=\"h2\">Microwave ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microwave energy also uses heat for use in thermal ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In contrast to RFA, a microwave incorporates an antenna to receive externally applied energy at 930 to 2450 mHz. This microwave energy results in rotation of polar molecules that is opposed by frictional forces, which is then converted to heat. Microwave ablation is becoming increasingly popular for ablation of liver and lung tumors, but data for use for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are still limited. One meta-analysis comparing microwave ablation with cryoablation showed that both were effective and resulted in similar efficacy (93.8 versus 91.3 percent, respectively) and cancer-specific survival (98.3 versus 96.8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Since cryoablation and RFA have already been established as effective methods, it is unlikely that any meaningful difference will be demonstrated without a large multi-institutional clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A potential advantage of microwave ablation over RFA is greater energy deposition, particularly when tissue vaporization occurs, and thus the development of higher temperatures. The higher energy may also be more resilient to the heat-sink effect, which can be an important obstacle for RFA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Emerging technologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new alternative that is still mostly performed only within clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>]. IRE uses delivery of focal micro- to millisecond electrical pulses via thin needles to induce cell death by disrupting the cell membrane. Unlike RFA or microwave, heat is not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, blood vessels, bile ducts, and nerves may be more protected, making it preferred in certain locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This could make this technology better for central tumors in the kidney where there is a risk of damage to the urinary collecting system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, IRE is considered experimental because its efficacy and safety have not been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance after ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT or MRI is typically used to assess the success of tumor ablation, starting approximately one month after treatment. On CT, viable tumor is usually nodular and maintains its enhancement (&gt;10 Hounsfield units after contrast injection), whereas successfully ablated tumor no longer enhances with contrast.</p><p>Imaging immediately following the ablation is difficult to interpret because inflammation at the periphery of the lesion may mimic viable tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, post-treatment CT imaging is usually performed at three to six months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after ablation, and yearly thereafter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid advances in technique and experience make interpretation of the reported results difficult. There are no randomized trials comparing these techniques with surgery, and such trials are not likely to be carried out in the near future.</p><p>Multiple series have reported excellent short-term disease control with both radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. More limited long-term outcomes in non-surgical patients are also encouraging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. The results appear comparable to those with partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, these results are not definitive. One meta-analysis suggested local recurrence might be slightly higher with cryoablation, while perioperative outcomes appear slightly better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. By contrast, another meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], underscoring difficulties in comparing procedural outcomes when both procedures are effective and when no randomized comparative data exist.</p><p>Additional long-term follow-up is required before these techniques can be considered as an alternative to surgery in patients who are candidates for a definitive surgical resection. Therefore, the risk of perioperative complications and declines in renal function must be balanced against the risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both RFA and cryoablation appear to be well-tolerated, with a low incidence of serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/14,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,35</a>]. A self-limited syndrome manifested by fever and flu-like symptoms has been reported in up to one-third of patients following RFA and cryoablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Available data from retrospective series do provide some insight into the relative safety and efficacy of the percutaneous versus laparoscopic routes of treatment, as well as the relative benefits of RFA versus cryoablation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous versus laparoscopic ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that compared the efficacy of a percutaneous versus a laparoscopic approach to renal cell carcinoma (RCC) ablation.</p><p>These approaches were compared in a meta-analysis that included data from 46 observational series (28 with percutaneous treatment and 18 with laparoscopic therapy), which included 1055 patients who were treated for 1180 tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Of the 28 series using a percutaneous approach, 21 used RFA and seven used cryoablation; of the 18 series performed with laparoscopy, three used RFA and 15 used cryoablation.</p><p>Key observations from this review included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor size was similar in the percutaneous and laparoscopic treatment groups (2.8 and 2.5 cm, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major complications were less frequent with percutaneous treatment (3.1 versus 7.4 percent using laparoscopy), and the mean hospital stay was shorter (1.4 versus 3.0 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A percutaneous approach was less effective than a laparoscopic approach when only the initial treatment was considered (87 versus 94), and retreatment was required more frequently.

Long-term follow-up data are very limited, but limited results suggest that the recurrence-free survival rate is approximately 90 percent at five years for either approach.</p><p>A single-center comparison suggests no significant difference in renal function wither either approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">RFA versus cryoablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that compare RFA with cryoablation in the management of RCC. Numerous retrospective series have been published, which do give some insight into the outcomes with these approaches. However, any real difference between cryoablation and RFA is likely very small. It is unlikely that a randomized trial will be performed given the large number of patients and expense needed in order to adequately power the study and determine any meaningful difference. In addition, small differences may not affect the choice of modality, as operator expertise and comfort are likely dominant contributing factors to outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The results with these two approaches were compared in a meta-analysis that included 47 series and consisted of patients with sporadic, localized RCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Although these approaches offer some significant advantages, long-term efficacy data are lacking.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stage I, II, or III RCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110735 \">table 1</a>), we recommend surgery as the primary treatment approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive surgical management of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For carefully selected patients, RFA, cryoablation, and other emerging technologies represent less invasive alternatives associated with less morbidity and fewer complications. However, the long-term efficacy of these approaches remains to be established. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient factors that potentially make ablation advantageous include older age, significant comorbidity, or the need to preserve as much renal parenchyma as possible (eg, patients with a solitary kidney, those with multiple lesions). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most favorable lesions for use of an ablative approach are smaller RCCs (&le;4 cm) and those in the periphery of the kidney. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials comparing RFA with cryoablation, or laparoscopic approaches with percutaneous approaches. For patients who are treated with ablation, the choice of RFA or cryoablation should be based upon the availability of local expertise. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'RFA versus cryoablation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous versus laparoscopic ablation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wendler JJ, Porsch M, Nitschke S, et al.
