Virtually all cases of severe diuretic-induced hyponatremia have been due to a thiazide-type diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. A loop diuretic is much less likely to induce this problem unless the diuretic has induced volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or water intake is very high (since loop diuretics partially impair urinary diluting capacity). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The difference in hyponatremic risk between thiazide-type and loop diuretics may be related to differences in their tubular site of action. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanism of action of diuretics&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop diuretics inhibit sodium chloride (NaCl) reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The reabsorption of NaCl without water in the medullary aspect of this segment is normally the first step in the generation of the hyperosmotic gradient in the medullary interstitium. In the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the highly concentrated interstitium allows water to be reabsorbed in the medullary collecting tubule down the favorable osmotic gradient between the tubular lumen and the interstitium, resulting in the excretion of a concentrated urine.<br/><br/>Administration of a loop diuretic interferes with this process by impairing the accumulation of NaCl in the medulla. Thus, although the loop diuretic can increase ADH levels by inducing volume depletion, responsiveness to ADH is reduced because of the impairment in the medullary gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result, water retention and the development of hyponatremia will be limited, unless distal delivery is very low or water intake is very high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thiazides, in comparison, act in the cortex in the distal tubule; as a result, they do not interfere with medullary function or with ADH-induced water retention. In addition, in vitro data indicate that thiazides increase water permeability and water reabsorption in the inner medullary collecting duct, an effect that is independent of ADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition to water retention, the combination of increased sodium and potassium excretion (due to the diuretic) and enhanced water reabsorption (due to ADH) can result in the excretion of urine with a sodium plus potassium concentration higher than that of the plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Loss of this fluid can directly promote the development of hyponatremia independent of the degree of water intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>As with other diuretic-induced fluid and electrolyte complications, hyponatremia often develops within the <strong>first one to two weeks of therapy</strong> if diuretic dose and dietary intake remain relatively constant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/1,3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,11</a>]. After this period, the patient is in a new steady state in which further sodium and water losses do not occur. However, in many patients with diuretic-induced hyponatremia, the disorder first appears after many months of uncomplicated thiazide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>]. In these patients, perturbation of the steady state, such as an acute gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, an increase in diuretic dose, or the development of heart failure, may explain the hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=time-course-of-loop-and-thiazide-diuretic-induced-electrolyte-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Time course of loop and thiazide diuretic-induced electrolyte complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The reproducibility of thiazide-induced hyponatremia was evaluated in a study of 11 older-adult patients with a history of thiazide-induced hyponatremia to below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In addition, patients who have thiazide-induced hyponatremia may have lower pre-thiazide estimated glomerular filtration as compared with those who do not have thiazide-induced hyponatremia (72 versus 94 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased dietary protein intake, due to dietary preferences or acute illness, may limit electrolyte-free water excretion and predispose to hyponatremia in patients treated to thiazides. In the previously mentioned study of patients with a history of thiazide-induced hyponatremia, urea excretion was lower among cases after washout of diuretics than among controls (251 versus 346 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmoL/24</span> hours), although this was not explained by significant differences in dietary history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>Older-adult patients generally have a reduced ability to excrete a water load, an effect that is most prominent in those who have previously developed thiazide-induced hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the study mentioned above, for example, both plasma ADH and electrolyte-free water clearance were lower before and after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> administration in 15 patients with a history of thiazide-induced hyponatremia as compared with 15 hypertensive controls with no history of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Why this occurs is not clear, but decreased intrarenal generation of prostaglandins may be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A defect in water excretion due to prostaglandin deficiency would be amplified by thiazides since the reabsorption of NaCl without water at the thiazide-sensitive site in the distal tubule normally lowers the urine osmolality. However, this mechanism would not explain the seeming rarity of hyponatremia with loop diuretics, which also inhibit urinary dilution. Perhaps the shorter duration of action of the loop diuretics protects against hyponatremia.</p><p>Retention of water as a primary event can explain why many patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia behave as if they are volume expanded: the body weight may initially increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; the blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine concentration are generally low-normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]; and hypouricemia due to enhanced urinary uric acid excretion may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>]. All of these findings are similar to those in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), which is also associated with initial volume expansion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of adults with hyponatremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p>In the aggregate, these observations suggest that there are two different forms of diuretic-induced hyponatremia: one in which volume depletion stimulates the release of ADH; and another in which the patient may be slightly volume expanded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In most patients, the combination of sodium plus potassium loss and water retention accounts for essentially all of the fall in the plasma sodium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. However, there are patients in whom this does not appear to be the case, raising the possibility that the hyponatremia is due in part to osmotic inactivation of sodium in the cells or perhaps bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. How or if this actually occurs is not clear. A similar hypothesis was proposed in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH and then seemingly excluded by careful balance studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18442563\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND PATIENTS AT RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of thiazide-induced hyponatremia is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The best data come from a retrospective cohort study of 2613 newly treated hypertensive patients followed for 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium of 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or less, developed in 66 of 220 patients initiated on a thiazide (30 percent) compared with 422 of 2393 patients started on alternate therapy (18 percent). Most cases of hyponatremia in patients taking thiazides occurred in the first three months of treatment. However, the risk of hyponatremia continued to be higher in the group exposed to thiazides throughout the 10 years of observation. Among those that developed hyponatremia, the median time to diagnosis was 1.75 years, emphasizing the importance of continued follow-up of patients started on thiazide diuretics. The incidence of hyponatremia associated with thiazide therapy was slightly, but not significantly, more common with advancing age (ie, 37 versus 24 percent comparing those above and below 60 years of age). After taking into account other risk factors for hyponatremia, thiazide therapy was associated with one excess case of hyponatremia for every 15 patients treated.</p><p>The association of thiazide-induced hyponatremia with older age, particularly those with low body weight, has been noted in other studies as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/1-5,12,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,12,22,23</a>]. As an example, a case controlled study in hospitalized patients found that patient age and body mass were independent risk factors for thiazide-induced hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Each 10-year increment of age was associated with a twofold increase in risk, and every 5 kg increment in body mass decreased the odds ratio by 27 percent. Alcoholics, particularly beer drinkers, and patients with psychogenic polydipsia who depend on the excretion of maximally dilute urine to maintain water balance are also at risk. In addition, genetic factors may increase the risk of thiazide-induced hyponatremia. A study of Chinese patients, for example, found that two polymorphisms of the <em>KCNJ1 </em>gene encoding the ROMK potassium channel (rs1231254 and rs2509585) were significantly more common among 48 thiazide-treated patients with serum sodium concentrations of &lt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> than among 211 normonatremic thiazide-treated controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of diuretic-induced hyponatremia are similar to those of other causes of hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The hyponatremia typically begins soon after the onset of thiazide therapy and corrects over a period of days to two weeks after the cessation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Most patients do not exhibit signs of volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p>Diuretic-induced hyponatremia is rarely, if ever, associated with cerebral edema severe enough to cause herniation of the brain. This was illustrated in a series of 223 patients hospitalized for symptomatic hyponatremia due to thiazide diuretics; the mean plasma sodium was 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The major symptoms were malaise, lethargy, dizzy spells, and vomiting, all of which are well described manifestations of severe hyponatremia. There was only a 1 percent incidence of seizures and no cases of herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The older literature includes reports of brain damage in outpatients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. However, at the time of the study, the consequences of overly rapid correction were unknown. The reported patients were all treated with hypertonic saline, increasing the plasma sodium concentration by more than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in 48 hours, a rate of correction now known to be associated with osmotic demyelination in the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of diuretic-induced hyponatremia consists of discontinuing the diuretic and administering either isotonic saline or, if the hyponatremia is severe or symptomatic, hypertonic saline. There is a potential risk of overly rapid correction of the hyponatremia with either regimen. Once the diuretic has been cleared and the patient becomes euvolemic, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release will be appropriately suppressed, resulting in the excretion of a dilute urine, which can lead to rapid excretion of the excess water. Thus, patients with moderate to severe hyponatremia must be monitored carefully during treatment to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyponatremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Preemptive administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> has been used to prevent the excretion of dilute urine.
