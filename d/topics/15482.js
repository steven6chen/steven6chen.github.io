The most prevalent form of SAD is winter depression, marked by recurrent episodes of unipolar depression that begin in the fall or winter and if left untreated, generally remit in the following spring or summer. Recognizing the disorder is important because SAD is common and associated with psychosocial impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, acute treatment is often effective and maintenance treatment can prevent future episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among patients who were recruited for randomized trials studying treatment of winter depression, nearly 60 percent had never been treated for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>This topic discusses the treatment of SAD; most of the topic is devoted to recurrent unipolar major depression with winter seasonal pattern (winter depression). The epidemiology, neurobiology, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and validity of SAD are discussed separately.

Patients with severe major depression who are assessed with the self-administered Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (PHQ-9) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 5</a>) typically score 20 or more points, and often report suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, severely ill patients are more likely to experience complications, such as psychotic features or catatonic features, and are often referred to psychiatrists for management. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild to moderate illness</strong> &ndash; Patients with major depression who are mildly to moderately ill often have only five or six depressive symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>) (at least five are necessary to make the diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Symptoms are distressing but manageable, and functional impairment is not necessarily obvious to others. Patients with mild to moderate major depression who are assessed with the self-administered PHQ-9 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 5</a>) typically score less than 20 points, and often deny suicidal behavior. In addition, patients are unlikely to experience complications, such as psychotic features or catatonic features, and are typically managed by primary care clinicians or mental health clinicians other than psychiatrists. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155707531\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing prior response to pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caution is warranted in assessing prior responses to antidepressant medications in patients with winter depression; a previous &ldquo;response&rdquo; in the spring or summer may have been a placebo response rather than a true medication response. In placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, patients with major depression (not selected for the presence or absence of seasonal pattern) are less likely to have a placebo response from November through February compared with other times of the year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, a study examined patients with depressive syndromes (n = 432) who were not selected for seasonality and who received a 10-day course of placebo as a &ldquo;washout&rdquo; or lead-in to a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Response to placebo occurred in fewer patients during the late fall and winter months than the rest of year (15 versus 25 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184741578\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with SAD who have recurrent unipolar major depression with seasonal pattern, we suggest monitoring response to treatment in manner similar to that for patients with nonseasonal depression.

However, a longer course of therapy may be necessary before deciding that the treatment has failed.

Winter depression is the most prevalent type of seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

Patients initially receive first line therapy and progress through each step until they respond. The duration of an adequate treatment trial is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H59766708\" class=\"local\">'Duration of an adequate trial'</a> above.)</p><p>Following response, treatment continues for at least two weeks beyond the usual spring or summer offset of winter depression. (See <a href=\"#H155708958\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary treatments suggested in the subsections below, either as monotherapy or combination therapy, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapy</p><p/><p>In addition, we encourage patients to incorporate all of the following adjunctive interventions throughout their entire course of acute (and maintenance) treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 6</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily walks outside, even on cloudy days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerobic exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced indoor lighting with regular lamps and fixtures </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dawn simulation (see <a href=\"#H437866573\" class=\"local\">'Dawn simulation'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Sleep hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 6</a>), including a regular sleep-wake cycle, is important for treating SAD because hypersomnia and insomnia are common in SAD. As part of sleep hygiene, creating a regular light-dark cycle may be important. Minimizing light exposure, especially blue light from computer monitors and televisions, in the late evening (eg, during the two hours prior to the desired time of sleep onset) may facilitate sleep onset. &#160; </p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of acute treatments for winter depression is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H89640513\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of acute treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155707397\"><span class=\"h3\">First line</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with winter depression, we suggest an antidepressant drug plus artificial light (bright light therapy, dawn simulation, or both) as first line treatment. However, antidepressants alone are a reasonable alternative. The specific choice depends upon factors such as prior treatment history, severity of illness (see <a href=\"#H155707729\" class=\"local\">'Severity of winter depression'</a> above), safety, tolerability, cost, and patient preference. As an example, more severely ill patients may benefit from pharmacotherapy plus both bright light therapy and dawn simulation, rather than just one form of light therapy. Some patients prefer antidepressant monotherapy because of relative contraindications to bright light therapy (eg, retinal disease or use of photosensitizing medications) or because bright light therapy is inconvenient and tedious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dawn simulation is appealing because it is administered at the end of the night, while patients are still asleep; however, the device may wake a sleeping partner. First line treatment with pharmacotherapy plus light therapy or pharmacotherapy alone is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines (eg, American Psychiatric Association and World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/12,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17-19</a>].</p><p>The initial drug of choice for winter SAD is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], consistent with initial treatment in the general population of patients with unipolar major depression. However, other types of antidepressants can be used instead of SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> is a good choice for patients who want to stop smoking tobacco or want to avoid SSRI side effects, such as weight gain or sexual dysfunction. In addition, bupropion has demonstrated efficacy in preventing recurrences of winter depression (see <a href=\"#H155709005\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> below). Additional information about the general treatment of unipolar major depression, including the choice of drug, doses, and side effects, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment#H21696486\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Antidepressant pharmacotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with mild to moderate winter depression, light therapy (bright light therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dawn simulation) alone is also a reasonable alternative as first line therapy, and is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines (eg, American Psychiatric Association and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/12,13,17,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,17,18,21</a>]. Patients may prefer light therapy alone because it avoids medication safety risks and side effects. However, light therapy alone is generally regarded as inadequate for severe episodes of winter depression. The administration, safety, and side effects of bright light therapy are discussed elsewhere in this topic (see <a href=\"#H41983961\" class=\"local\">'Bright light therapy'</a> below), as is the administration of dawn simulation (see <a href=\"#H437866573\" class=\"local\">'Dawn simulation'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155708066\"><span class=\"h3\">Second line</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Winter depression often does not respond to first line treatment with an antidepressant drug plus light therapy. For these patients, the next step is to verify the diagnosis and adherence, and to address factors that can cause nonresponse (see <a href=\"#H349801480\" class=\"local\">'Managing treatment resistance'</a> above). If this step is completed and the patient remains unresponsive, we suggest switching antidepressants and continuing light therapy. If patients do not respond to one drug switch, the antidepressant is switched at least one or two more times. Switching antidepressants for managing treatment resistant depression is consistent with multiple practice guidelines (eg, the American Psychiatric Association, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, and United Kingdom National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/8,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22-26</a>]. Choosing an alternative antidepressant and the process of switching antidepressants are discussed separately.

Adjunctive psychotherapy may increase adherence and reduce distress. We typically use cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT); however, other psychotherapies (eg, interpersonal psychotherapy) are reasonable alternatives. The availability of psychotherapy is often limited, especially CBT that is specifically adapted for SAD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155708278\"><span class=\"h3\">Other options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe winter depression (see <a href=\"#H155707729\" class=\"local\">'Severity of winter depression'</a> above) who do not respond to first, second, and third line therapies, we suggest electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

(Incandescent light poses risks to the cornea and retina.) Although light boxes emitting less than 10,000 lux can be used, longer exposures are required. Commercially available fixtures are recommended over homemade devices, due to difficulty in measuring light intensity, and to reduce electrical hazards and other risks (eg, corneal and eyelid burns) associated with poor-quality construction. In addition, patients are advised to seek light boxes designed to protect the eyes with features such as light dispersion and screens that filter out ultraviolet rays.

Commercial light box instructions should give the distance at which 10,000 lux is achieved, which is typically approximately 40 to 80 cm (16 to 31 inches). The distance from the eyes to the light box is important because light intensity follows the inverse square law; if the distance between the eye and the light source is doubled, the intensity of light that is received drops to one-quarter of the original intensity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Time of day</strong> &ndash; Bright light therapy generally commences in the early morning, soon after awakening (eg, 7:00 AM). Patients should administer light therapy at approximately the same time each day, including weekends, holidays, and vacations. Most light therapy studies required a regular time for light treatment to start and thus stipulated a regular wake-up time for the subjects. A regular wake-up time may be important for optimal effectiveness of the bright light treatment. The effectiveness of variable timing of the bright light therapy is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If morning bright light treatment alone is not fully effective after two to four weeks of treatment, adding evening (eg, 8:00 PM) bright light treatment may be helpful.

Clinicians should also monitor patients for emerging <span class=\"nowrap\">hypomanic/manic</span> symptoms. For example, outpatients can be seen weekly for the first two weeks, with the subsequent frequency determined by response and side effects. If morning bright light treatment is associated with new onset insomnia, the bright light treatment is stopped until the insomnia resolves and is then restarted at a lower intensity or shorter duration.</p><p>Following response to acute treatment with adjunctive light therapy in conjunction with pharmacotherapy, light therapy is continued for at least two weeks beyond the usual spontaneous offset of winter depression; premature discontinuation of light therapy can precipitate relapse. Pharmacotherapy is continued indefinitely. (See <a href=\"#H155709121\" class=\"local\">'Light therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-choosing-maintenance-treatment#H259506092\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Choosing maintenance treatment&quot;, section on 'Duration'</a>.) </p><p>The administration, safety, and side effects of bright light therapy are discussed elsewhere in this topic.

Patients were not selected on the basis of a diagnosis of major depression with seasonal features and were enrolled throughout all four seasons. Nevertheless, seasonality traits were present in more than 80 percent of patients, and nearly 75 percent were enrolled during the fall and winter. Add-on study treatments were administered at midday (between 12:00 PM and 2:30 PM) and the target dose was 60 minutes per day by week 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Among patients who completed at least one study visit between weeks 4 and 6 (n = 40), remission was greater with bright light therapy than dim red light (68 versus 22 percent). In addition, functioning improved more with bright light therapy. None of the study patients switched polarity. However, the study results may have been biased, because the analyses included only the patients who completed at least one study visit between weeks four and six (n = 40), rather than all of the patients who were initially randomized (n = 46).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The choice of midday bright light may have been important. In prior, small prospective observational studies, bright light in the morning was associated with mood instability and worsening, whereas midday light appeared to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A two-week trial enrolled patients with bipolar major depression who had not responded to pharmacotherapy and randomly assigned them to adjunctive bright light therapy (5000 lux) or placebo (dim red light, &lt;100 lux) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Patients with seasonal affective disorder were not specifically included, and seasonality traits were not assessed; both inpatients and outpatients were included. Add-on study treatments were administered in the morning for 60 minutes. Among the patients who completed the study (n = 63), response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred in more patients who received bright light therapy than placebo (79 versus 43 percent).

It is not considered a separate mood disorder; rather, SAD is a subtype of unipolar major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder. The treatment of SAD depends upon the specific mood disorder that is present and the severity of illness. This topic focuses primarily upon recurrent unipolar major depression with winter seasonal pattern (winter depression). (See <a href=\"#H10732871\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H209778\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary treatments for SAD include antidepressants, light therapy, and psychotherapy. Adjunctive interventions include sleep hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F71116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116 \">table 6</a>), daily walks outside, aerobic exercise, enhanced indoor lighting, and awakening from sleep with light. (See <a href=\"#H155707268\" class=\"local\">'Approach to acute treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with winter depression, we suggest an antidepressant drug plus artificial light (bright light therapy, dawn simulation, or both) as first line treatment, rather than other treatment regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, antidepressants alone are a reasonable alternative. The initial drug of choice is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. For patients with mild to moderate winter depression, light therapy alone is also a reasonable alternative as first line therapy. However, light therapy alone is generally regarded as inadequate for severe episodes of winter depression. (See <a href=\"#H155707397\" class=\"local\">'First line'</a> above and <a href=\"#H155707729\" class=\"local\">'Severity of winter depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not respond satisfactorily to first line treatment with an antidepressant drug plus light therapy, we suggest switching antidepressants and continuing light therapy as second line treatment, rather than other treatment regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H155708066\" class=\"local\">'Second line'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with winter depression who partially respond to first line treatment with antidepressants alone, we continue the drug and add artificial light (bright light therapy, dawn simulation, or both) as second line treatment. For patients who respond minimally or not all to first line treatment with antidepressants alone, we switch the drug and add light therapy. (See <a href=\"#H155708066\" class=\"local\">'Second line'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with winter depression who do not respond to first line treatment with light therapy alone, we continue light therapy and add an antidepressant drug as second line treatment. (See <a href=\"#H155708066\" class=\"local\">'Second line'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Winter depression that does not respond to first and second line therapies is generally managed by adding psychotherapy as third line treatment. We typically use cognitive-behavioral therapy; however, other psychotherapies (eg, interpersonal psychotherapy) are reasonable alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H155708222\" class=\"local\">'Third line'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe winter depression who do not respond to first, second, and third line therapies may be candidates for electroconvulsive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H155708278\" class=\"local\">'Other options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Winter depression is by definition a recurrent illness, and maintenance treatment is typically indicated to prevent recurrences, especially among patients who suffer suicidal ideation and behavior, or impairment that threatens occupational or interpersonal functioning. The same treatment that was successfully used acutely is typically selected for maintenance treatment. (See <a href=\"#H155708958\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment#H14391901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15417921\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Sy Atezaz Saeed, MD and Timothy J Bruce, PhD who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Magnusson A, Partonen T.
