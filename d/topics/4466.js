The conduction disturbance can be transient or permanent, with conduction that is delayed, intermittent, or absent. Commonly used terminology includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First degree AV block &ndash; Delayed conduction from the atrium to the ventricle (defined as a prolonged PR interval of &gt;200 milliseconds) without interruption in atrial to ventricular conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second degree AV block &ndash; Intermittent atrial conduction to the ventricle, often in a regular pattern (eg, 2:1, 3:2), or higher degrees of block, which are further classified into Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) and Mobitz type II second degree AV block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third degree (complete) AV block &ndash; No atrial impulses conduct to the ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade AV block &ndash; Two or more consecutive blocked P waves.</p><p/><p>Atrioventricular block is considered to be &quot;congenital&quot; when it occurs spontaneously in a fetus or young child. Congenital complete heart block (CHB) was first described in 1901 by Morquio, who also noted the familial occurrence and the association with Stokes-Adams attacks and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The presence of fetal bradycardia (40 to 80 beats per minute) as a manifestation of CHB was first noted in 1921 and is the initial sign of this disorder in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, etiologies, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis associated with congenital CHB will be presented here.

These hearts do not have a proper triangle of Koch, and the compact node is consequently displaced in a posterior direction beneath the mouth of coronary sinus.

The primary finding in children with congenital CHB is a slow heart rate with or without bradycardia-related symptoms, including reduced exercise tolerance and presyncope or syncope (Stokes-Adams attacks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/7,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,40</a>].

While congenital CHB diagnosed for the first time later in childhood may be congenital in origin, escaping notice because of a higher ventricular rate and the absence of symptoms, patients who present later in childhood likely have preserved AV conduction at birth and acquire progressive AV nodal disease thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a single center of 102 patients with congenital CHB diagnosed over a 34-year period, the number of presentations later in childhood remained constant from 1980 to 1998 despite the introduction of fetal echocardiography and the wide availability of heart rate monitoring during pregnancy and labor, suggesting that AV conduction is preserved at birth and becomes abnormal at a later time in a subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Maternal autoantibody exposure accounts for almost all cases presenting in utero or the neonatal period, but for only a few cases occurring at older ages (5 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Rarely, complete AV block can occur in which the atrial rate is exactly twice the ventricular rate (eg, atrial rate of 80 beats per minute with a ventricular rate of 40 beats per minute), in which case the appearance on ECG could be similar to that of second degree AV (ie, 2:1) block.

Implants for infants and very young children will usually require epicardial leads due to small caliber of the standard insertion veins used for transvenous devices, as well as the expectation for thoracic growth that may eventually place tension on transvenous leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Epicardial leads are also used in patients of any age with septal defects that allow intracardiac shunting and thus increase the risk of thromboembolic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A transvenous dual-chamber pacemaker is preferred at most centers when there are no significant size constraints or other contraindications.

The ventricular rate tends to fall slowly with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. To compensate for the slow heart rate, the heart enlarges to produce a higher stroke volume; in some cases, this can lead to voltage criteria for left ventricular enlargement and nonspecific ST-T wave changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] as well as to heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>In general, the prognosis following pacemaker implantation is excellent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block/abstract/37,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,54,55</a>].

Autoimmune CHB due to maternal auto antibodies that cross the placenta is responsible for 60 to 90 percent of cases of congenital CHB overall. (See <a href=\"#H2482259254\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The manifestations of congenital CHB vary according to the age at presentation, underlying etiology, ventricular rate of the escape rhythm, and ventricular function. The primary finding in neonates with congenital CHB is a slow heart rate that is usually less than 100 beats per minute. Neonates with congenital CHB otherwise have few specific physical examination findings, although they may appear pale or diaphoretic related to the reduction in cardiac output. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In nearly all cases, the diagnosis of complete heart block can be made by obtaining a surface electrocardiogram (ECG), ideally a full 12-lead ECG but sometimes a single-lead rhythm strip is adequate if a full 12-lead ECG cannot be obtained. The diagnosis is usually suspected when a slow pulse is detected and heart block is confirmed by ECG or by ambulatory ECG monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H3460898515\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For neonates and children who present later with congenital CHB, the principal therapeutic decision involves the need for and the potential timing of permanent pacemaker insertion. For older children who are able to express themselves about symptoms, the presence or absence of symptoms will help guide the decision. Patients with an adequate ventricular heart rate and no symptoms can usually be followed with serial observation, while symptomatic patients (typically those with a slower ventricular heart rate) will require a permanent pacemaker. In general, the prognosis following pacemaker implantation is excellent.
