Preschool wheezing, a symptom that can herald the subsequent development of childhood asthma, is a common problem worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the condition improves and ultimately disappears by school years in many children. Proper identification of infants and young children at increased risk to develop persistent asthma may help predict long-term outcomes and improve prevention and treatment, but the ability to identify these children remains limited.</p><p>Several classifications of wheezing phenotypes and other tools have been developed in an effort to categorize children with recurrent wheezing and determine which will ultimately develop asthma. These wheezing phenotypes and predictive tools are reviewed in this topic. The definition and diagnosis of asthma in children; asthma risk factors, genetics, and natural history; bronchiolitis and virus-induced wheezing; and other causes of wheezing in children are discussed separately.

Wheezing phenotypes have been defined to identify the characteristics and risk factors associated with children that experience wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some of these phenotypes describe children who continue to wheeze until later childhood, while others identify those who continue to wheeze through adolescence and adulthood. However, the relationship between risk factors and the subsequent development of asthma in later childhood and adult life is not clear.</p><p>Many of these early childhood wheezing phenotypes were determined retrospectively in longitudinal studies. However, it can be difficult to clinically distinguish among these phenotypes during the preschool years because of the variation in expression of both symptoms and risk factors over time. In addition, the application of these phenotypes to diverse populations is not established, and it is not clear which are the most effective therapies for a particular wheezing phenotype or whether early intervention can alter the course and outcome over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059571\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiologic phenotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several epidemiologic phenotypes, based upon wheezing history, have been developed. There is some variability in age cutoffs differentiating among transient, persistent, and late-onset wheezing and inconsistencies in which risk factors are associated with each phenotype. There are also concerns about the prospective validity of these phenotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H797255817\"><span class=\"h3\">Tucson classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS), four different wheezing phenotypes were identified among 1246 newborns followed for lower respiratory tract infections based upon the presence of wheezing symptoms during the first three years of life and again at six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The classification was the same as the Tucson classification with the exception that the cutoff for distinguishing between transient early wheezing and persistent wheezing was two, not three, years of age. Of the 16,333 children aged six to seven years in this population-based cohort, 83 percent had never wheezed, 7 percent had transient early wheezing, 4 percent had persistent wheezing, and 6 percent had late-onset wheezing.</p><p>Subsequent prospective studies of the Tucson cohort led to revised definitions of the three groups of wheezers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient wheeze in infancy &ndash; Begins in infancy (the first year of life) and resolves by the preschool years; associated with decreased lung function, narrower intrapulmonary airways, maternal tobacco use during pregnancy, having siblings, and daycare attendance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonatopic persistent wheezing phenotype &ndash; Begins in infancy and resolves in mid-childhood; associated with lack of both allergic sensitization and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> hyperresponsiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin E <span class=\"nowrap\">(IgE)-associated/atopic</span> persistent wheezing phenotype &ndash; Can begin in infancy but increases in prevalence with age; associated with personal and family history of atopy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> hyperresponsiveness, and poor growth of lung function. This phenotype may represent a classic allergic asthma phenotype, but it is unknown if children with this phenotype will have symptoms that persist into adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H797255831\"><span class=\"h3\">Avon classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective longitudinal study of a population-based cohort in the United Kingdom, looked at maternal reports of child wheezing between birth and six months and again between 30 and 42 months in 8594 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Early infant wheeze was defined as those who wheezed during the first six months, late-onset wheeze as those who wheezed between 30 to 42 months but not early infancy, and persistent wheeze as those who wheezed during both periods. A parental history of asthma (particularly maternal) and a personal history of atopic disease were predictive of wheezing in all three groups. Wheezing only during early infancy was associated with other factors, such as maternal smoking during pregnancy and the presence of older siblings, whereas persistent wheezing was associated with preterm delivery and lower socioeconomic status.</p><p>The wheezing phenotypes from the Avon study were further refined with continued longitudinal follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Data were collected at more time points and over shorter intervals than the Tucson study. Incorporation of objective measures (eg, lung function and allergen sensitization) and use of more sophisticated statistical methods led to the inclusion of two additional phenotypes to the Tucson classification (prolonged early wheeze and intermediate-onset wheeze):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Never/infrequent</span> wheeze (59 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient early wheeze (16 percent) &ndash; Wheezing common from 6 to 18 months but rare to never after 42 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged early wheeze (9 percent) &ndash; Wheezing common from 6 to 54 months but rare to never after 69 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate-onset wheeze (3 percent) &ndash; Wheezing rare to never from 6 to 18 months but common thereafter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late-onset wheeze (6 percent) &ndash; Infrequent wheezing from 6 to 42 months but common thereafter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent wheeze (7 percent) &ndash; Wheezing common from six months onward</p><p/><p>Similar wheezing phenotypes were identified in the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) birth cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23802506\"><span class=\"h2\">Trousseau wheezing phenotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three wheezing phenotypes were identified in a cross-sectional analysis of 551 children less than 36 months of age with recurrent wheezing enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program in France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These categories share some similarities with both the epidemiologic and symptom-based phenotypes. It is not known whether these phenotypes are persistent over time. Factors examined in the cluster analysis included disease severity, wheezing triggers, family and personal history of atopy, inflammatory markers, and chest radiograph results. Most of the children had uncontrolled or partially controlled wheezing and were treated with inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p>The three wheezing clusters identified were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild episodic viral wheeze (59.3 percent) &ndash; Most children in this group had mild disease, wheezing triggered by viral upper respiratory infections (URIs), and normal chest radiographs.

This cluster had the highest percentage of girls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atopic multiple-trigger wheeze (12.2 percent) &ndash; This group was characterized by multiple wheezing triggers (eg, URIs, exercise, cold air), higher percentage of boys, eczema, increased laboratory markers of atopy (eg, elevated total and specific IgE), and abnormal chest radiographs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059585\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom-based phenotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic phenotypes are limited by their retrospectively defined patterns of duration of wheeze. This limitation led to the proposal of phenotypes based upon temporal patterns of wheeze that can be applied prospectively and may therefore be more useful when making treatment decisions.</p><p>The European Respiratory Society defined two symptom-based phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodic (viral) wheeze &ndash; Wheezing during discrete time periods, with absence of wheeze between episodes; usually associated with viral respiratory tract infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multi-trigger wheeze &ndash; Wheezing both during discrete exacerbations and between episodes; triggers include viruses, allergens, exercise, and cigarette smoke</p><p/><p>Airway function, particularly conductive airways ventilation inhomogeneity, was lower in multiple-trigger than episodic wheeze, suggesting that these are functionally different phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, in one study, over half of children classified into these two phenotypes based upon their wheezing history in the previous year switched to the other phenotype in the ensuing year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], suggesting that these phenotypes are not stable over time.</p><p>Another study compared epidemiologic phenotype definitions identified by latent class analysis (similar to the Avon classification: persistent, late onset, intermediate, transient, and <span class=\"nowrap\">none/infrequent)</span> with clinical phenotypes based upon patient histories from one to six years of age in an international, multicenter birth cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Four clinically defined wheeze phenotypes (recurrent unremitting wheeze, unremitting wheeze, asthma diagnosis, and frequent wheeze) were found to have a high sensitivity and specificity (displayed area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 97, 87, 85, and 84 percent, respectively). These findings suggest that these clinical phenotypes may be useful asthma definitions for future epidemiological studies. The clinical phenotypes were characterized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma diagnosis &ndash; Clinician diagnosis of asthma ever or recurrent diagnoses of spastic, obstructive, or asthmatic bronchitis by age six years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multi-trigger wheeze &ndash; At least two common asthma triggers leading to wheeze between ages three to six years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unremitting wheeze &ndash; Having symptoms between wheezing episodes or wheeze without a cold at least once between ages one to six years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent unremitting wheeze &ndash; Having symptoms between wheezing episodes or wheeze without a cold reported for two or more years between ages one to six years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent wheeze &ndash; Wheeze on a monthly basis for at least one year between ages one to six years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodic wheeze &ndash; Wheezing episodes associated with viral respiratory tract infections only between ages one to six years</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7929427\"><span class=\"h1\">ASTHMA RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic factors, perinatal exposures, and their interactions may contribute to the development of asthma. Other genetic, environmental, developmental, and host factors can alter the expression or persistence of the asthma phenotype over time. Some of these clinical indicators of risk are used in various predictive models to help the clinician identify those children who will continue wheezing into older childhood. Asthma risk factors are discussed in greater detail separately, but the key risk factors identified from the wheezing phenotypes studies are reviewed here.

Children in the late-onset and persistent wheezing phenotype groups had a significantly higher rate of allergen sensitization at six years of age than healthy children without wheezing (56 and 51 percent versus 34 percent, respectively). In addition, sensitization to the common mold <em>Alternaria</em> was associated with a higher rate of chronic asthma at age 22 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

These phenotypes also had the highest proportion of clinician-diagnosed asthma by 7.5 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H797255831\" class=\"local\">'Avon classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Differences in risk factors and outcomes are seen between nonatopic and atopic persistent wheezing phenotypes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with the nonatopic persistent wheezing phenotype, the initial wheezing episode occurs in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and the wheezing episodes become less frequent by early adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

It remains to be demonstrated if children with this phenotype will continue to experience symptoms that persist into later adulthood. Risk factors linked with atopic wheeze include parental asthma, male sex, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilia at nine months, a history of wheezing with lower respiratory tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], early sensitization to food or aeroallergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], and the development of symptoms between wheezing exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

These models have employed various risk factors associated with the development of asthma in epidemiologic studies, such as parental history of allergic sensitization and asthma, wheezing history, atopic disease in the child, immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and cytokine secretion profiles. However, none of these clinical tools have been validated in populations different from the study group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7931596\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictive scoring systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several asthma risk scores have been developed for use in children with at least one episode of wheezing in early childhood.

The major criteria were clinician-diagnosed eczema or parental asthma. The minor criteria were clinician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis, wheezing apart from colds, and eosinophilia &ge;4 percent. A positive loose index was defined as any parental report of wheezing on the surveys at two or three years of age and either one major criteria or two minor criteria. A positive stringent index was defined as frequent wheezing on these same surveys (score of &ge;3, scale: 1 to 5, from &quot;very rarely&quot; to &quot;on most days&quot;) plus the same combination of major or minor criteria. Children with a positive loose index were four times more likely to have active asthma during a subsequent survey at 6, 8, 11, or 13 years of age (sensitivity 42 percent, specificity 85 percent). Children with a positive stringent index were seven times more likely to have active asthma in at least one of these school-aged surveys (sensitivity 16 percent, specificity 97 percent).</p><p>The API was validated in a population-based birth cohort in Leicester, United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The API and wheeze frequency were assessed in 1954 children at three years of age and then compared with rates of asthma at 7 and 10 years of age. Results were similar to the findings in the Tucson cohort, with a fivefold increased risk of asthma at seven years of age with a positive loose API and an eightfold increased risk with a positive stringent API. Using a simpler rule of early wheeze (wheezing in the first three years of life) or early frequent wheeze yielded comparable results. Thus, using the simpler definition may save screening costs. However, the overall predictive performance for all measures was low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Yet there remains a need to identify children that are unlikely to develop later asthma in order to prevent exposing children inappropriately to costly preventive therapies with potential side effects. The sensitivity of the API index is low (15 to 57 percent), suggesting that the test is poor at predicting later asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wheezing-phenotypes-and-prediction-of-asthma-in-young-children/abstract/42-45,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45,48,49</a>].

Accurate classification of young children at high risk to develop persistent asthma may help predict long-term outcomes and identify children who may benefit from secondary prevention interventions. (See <a href=\"#H23915797\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing phenotypes have been defined to identify the characteristics and risk factors associated with children that experience wheezing. These include several epidemiologic phenotypes that are based upon wheezing history and symptom-based phenotypes that are based upon temporal patterns. The most well known of these phenotypes is the classification from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS) cohort, which divided young children with wheezing into the following groups: early, transient wheezers; persistent wheezers; and late-onset wheezers. The European Respiratory Society defined two symptom-based phenotypes: episodic (viral) wheeze and multi-trigger wheeze. (See <a href=\"#H23915804\" class=\"local\">'Wheezing phenotypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic, environmental, developmental, and host factors may contribute to the development of asthma and can alter the expression or persistence of the asthma phenotype over time. The major risk factors identified in various wheezing phenotype studies include the presence of atopy (in both the child and the parents), reduced lung function, and viral infections in infancy, particularly with rhinovirus. (See <a href=\"#H7929427\" class=\"local\">'Asthma risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various predictive models or clinical indicators of risk have been studied to help the clinician identify those children who will continue wheezing into older childhood. These models have employed various risk factors associated with the development of asthma in epidemiologic studies, such as parental history of allergic sensitization and asthma, wheezing history, atopic disease in the child, immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and cytokine secretion profiles. The most commonly used predictive scoring system is the Asthma Predictive Index (API).
