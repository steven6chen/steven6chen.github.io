In contrast to most other cells, RBCs have no cytoplasmic structures or organelles, no nucleus, and no cell-cell junctions that contribute to their shape.</p><p>Normal RBCs are biconcave discs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F117123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117123 \">picture 2</a>). In a two-dimensional view such as on the peripheral blood smear, the biconcave disc appears as a round cell with an area of central pallor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59683\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59683 \">picture 3</a>). The basis for this shape is the highly regulated ratio of membrane surface area to cytoplasmic volume, designated <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;SA/V</span>.&quot; The advantageous <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio of RBCs gives them a remarkable ability to deform and alter their shape to pass through narrow channels.</p><p>Deformability is a property that reflects the extent of membrane deformation that can be induced by a defined level of applied force. Most deformations do not involve an increase in surface area; rather, the membrane geometry is altered to allow a change in shape. Normal RBCs can undergo large linear extensions (of up to 230 percent of their original diameter) while maintaining a constant surface area. However, an increase of even 3 to 4 percent in surface area results in cell lysis.</p><p>The more deformable the membrane, the less force required for the cell to deform. A high degree of deformability is needed for RBCs to traverse small capillaries (as small as 3 microns) and splenic sinusoids (as small as 1 to 2 microns) that are smaller than the diameter of the RBCs (7 to 8 microns). The ability of the red cell to undergo extensive deformation is essential for both its function and its survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Red cell deformability is a function of three major attributes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Shape/geometry</span> (ie, the <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio) (see <a href=\"#H3991963788\" class=\"local\">'Surface area to volume ratio (SA/V)'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viscosity of the cytoplasm (see <a href=\"#H1247306713\" class=\"local\">'Cytoplasmic viscosity'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Material/mechanical</span> properties of the membrane related to protein-protein, lipid-lipid, and protein-lipid interactions (see <a href=\"#H1830324319\" class=\"local\">'Composition of the membrane/cytoskeleton'</a> below)</p><p/><p>In contrast to mature RBCs, reticulocytes are multilobular and motile; their deformability is only approximately 10 percent that of mature RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The deformability and mechanical stability of reticulocytes both improve during maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Major reorganizations of membrane phospholipids, cytoskeletal proteins, and integral proteins accompany acquisition of the discoid shape and the enhanced deformability. These changes include loss of membrane lipids; loss of integral proteins such as transferrin receptors, insulin receptors, and fibronectin receptors; a major reorganization of the cytoskeletal protein network; and a progressive loss of volume and cell water, resulting in an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3991963788\"><span class=\"h2\">Surface area to volume ratio (SA/V)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal RBCs have a volume of 90 fL and a surface area of 140 square microns. If the RBC were a sphere of identical volume, its surface area would be only 98 square microns. Thus, the biconcave discoid shape provides approximately 40 square microns of excess surface area (an additional 43 percent).</p><p>Reductions in the <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio (less plasma membrane for a given amount of cytoplasm) lead to changes in RBC shape (typically, spherocytosis) that translate into reduced deformability and often an increased rate of hemolysis. On the peripheral blood smear, spherocytes appear smaller than normal RBCs and lack central pallor. Increased osmotic fragility is a characteristic feature of spherocytes. In vitro studies have demonstrated that reduction of <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> by approximately 25 percent leads to rapid and complete entrapment in the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There are two mechanisms for decreasing the <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased plasma membrane surface area</strong> &ndash; A relative decrease in the amount of membrane area for the same amount of cell volume decreases the <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio. This occurs in disorders affecting RBC membrane homeostasis.

This occurs in hemolysis due to inappropriate use of water as a diluent for RBC transfusion and in certain hereditary anemias with genetic defects that affect RBC hydration (eg, hereditary stomatocytosis [HSt]). In HSt, the increased <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> results in a uni-concave cup, which appears as a stomatocyte on the peripheral blood smear. These disorders were discussed in a 2017 review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. They are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stomatocytosis and xerocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of red blood cell hydration&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>These disorders are discussed in more detail and in separate topic links provided below. (See <a href=\"#H274834414\" class=\"local\">'Clinical consequences'</a> below.)</p><p>Loss of membrane at a slower rate is a function of normal RBC aging. During their normal lifespan, RBCs become increasingly spherical (with a progressive reduction in <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V)</span> due to loss of surface area; this occurs as reticuloendothelial macrophages remove small pieces of membrane. This is the dominant mechanism for the removal of senescent RBCs from the circulation.</p><p>In contrast to conditions with decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratios, target cells are RBCs that have an <strong>increased</strong> <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio (more membrane for a given amount of cell volume). On the peripheral blood smear, target cells may be larger than normal RBCs and often have an area of central density within the region of central pallor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80318 \">picture 4</a>). Spur cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80080\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80080 \">picture 5</a>) are also produced by an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio. Target cells and spur cells can form with increased insertion of membrane cholesterol, as occurs in liver disease, or with decreased cytoplasmic volume, as occurs in thalassemia. In contrast to spherocytes, target cells have a normal lifespan and do not appear to undergo accelerated hemolysis. Target cells and spur cells have decreased, rather than increased, osmotic fragility.

The major contributing factor to viscosity in the RBC is the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which is determined by the ratio of hemoglobin to cell water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This is because hemoglobin is by far the most abundant protein in the RBC.</p><p>It is important to note that while the cell volume of mammalian RBCs varies over 10-fold, the MCHC is relatively invariant across species at approximately 33 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (range, 27 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>. This MCHC produces a viscosity of 5 to 15 centipoise (cP), which is 5 to 15 times greater than the viscosity of water. Above an MCHC of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> further increases in MCHC lead to exponential increases in viscosity (eg, 45 cP at 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> 170 cP at 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> and 650 cP at 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and viscosity may become the primary determinant of cellular deformability. This relationship between MCHC and viscosity is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82597 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The lipid components and integral proteins of the RBC membrane involved in transport function play a crucial role in volume homeostasis, maintaining the MCHC at levels that do not unduly influence the ability of the cell to deform. (See <a href=\"#H1830324319\" class=\"local\">'Composition of the membrane/cytoskeleton'</a> below.)</p><p>An abnormally high MCHC generally occurs when cell water is decreased (ie, cellular dehydration), which may be due to abnormalities in membrane channels or other alterations to membrane permeability. Examples include hereditary disorders affecting cellular channels (eg, hereditary xerocytosis) or disorders in which abnormal hemoglobins precipitate and interact with the RBC membrane (eg, sickle cell disease, hemoglobin C disease, thalassemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/3,5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,13</a>]. This effect on deformability may contribute to reduced oxygen delivery in these disorders.

The property of mechanical membrane stability is defined as the maximum extent of deformation that a membrane can undergo and still recover its initial shape. Any further increase in deformation results in membrane failure and cell fragmentation.</p><p>Membrane deformability and mechanical stability are regulated by multiple membrane properties such as elastic shear modulus, bending modulus, and yield stress.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elastic shear modulus is a measure of the magnitude of force needed to induce uni-axial deformation at a constant surface area. The higher the value, the greater the force needed to induce deformation. Shear modulus is regulated by both skeletal and membrane proteins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bending modulus is a measure of the contribution of bending effects to the total work of deformation. Bending modulus becomes important when there are large changes in membrane curvature, such as with spicule formation. Bending modulus is regulated primarily by the lipid bilayer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yield stress is the value of applied force at which the membrane begins to flow; it is a measure of the cohesion between the lipid bilayer and the underlying membrane skeleton.</p><p/><p>At small values of applied force for short duration, the red cell membrane behaves as a viscoelastic solid since it is capable of undergoing large elastic extensions and completely recovers its initial shape. Studies of biochemically perturbed RBC membranes and RBC membranes from various disease states have shown that deformability and stability can change with no fixed relationship to each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This observation implies that these two properties are regulated by different skeletal proteins and their interactions.</p><p>Normal membrane stability allows RBCs to circulate for 120 days without fragmenting. Decreased stability leads to RBC fragmentation under normal circulating stresses, and increased stresses in the circulation (such as microthrombi or vascular anomalies) lead to RBC fragmentation even when membrane stability and deformability are optimized.

In these cases, the <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio is decreased by increasing volume rather than by decreasing membrane area. Hereditary xerocytosis has increased cytoplasmic viscosity in addition to membrane abnormalities due to cell dehydration and consequent decreased osmotic fragility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stomatocytosis and xerocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>While normal RBCs completely recover their shape following repeated cycles of deformation in the circulation, RBCs in these conditions that have weakened or abnormal junctions between skeletal proteins fail to recover their initial shape and undergo plastic deformation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61578\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61578 \">figure 3</a>). This explains why splenectomy is effective in treating hemolytic anemia in some of these conditions, because many of these misshapen cells are sequestered and removed from circulation by the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. This is mostly true for HS and HE; the benefit of splenectomy is less clear in HSt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3285367427\"><span class=\"h2\">Inherited hemoglobinopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hemoglobinopathies, there is no direct abnormality in the membrane or cytoskeletal proteins. However, abnormal hemoglobins may precipitate and bind to the membrane, inducing deformation of the membrane. Repeated cycles of this process may cause the cells to become irreversibly damaged and unable to return to the normal biconcave disc shape. In some cases, precipitated hemoglobin at the membrane may induce membrane phagocytosis by reticuloendothelial macrophages. This is the case in sickle cell disease and more severe forms of thalassemia, especially alpha thalassemias. Alpha thalassemias also have an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio and a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), both of which are associated with positive effects on deformability; thus, the adverse effects of the RBC membrane are likely to outweigh these potentially positive effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048651279\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired hemolytic anemias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In acquired hemolytic anemias due to autoimmune mechanisms (eg, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia [AIHA]), RBCs become coated by antibodies, which leads to partial phagocytosis by reticuloendothelial macrophages and reduced membrane surface area. The resulting spherocytes have a reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio and reduced cellular deformability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of RBC destruction'</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, in liver disease, target cells or spur cells are formed when increased membrane cholesterol content raises the cell surface area; these cells have an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio and are not prone to hemolyze. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-spiculated-cells-echinocytes-and-acanthocytes-and-target-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of spiculated cells (echinocytes and acanthocytes) and target cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2341957252\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombotic microangiopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Membrane failure can also occur with a structurally normal RBC that is subjected to increasing degrees of deformation in which the membrane becomes more extended and some of the major structural molecules (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Spectrin'</a> above) attain their maximal linear extension. This point is the limit of reversible deformability. A continued application of force would require an increase in surface area and the breaking of junctional complexes; this occurs at the weakest of the lateral protein-protein associations (spectrin-spectrin junction or spectrin-actin-protein 4.1R junction), leading to loss of membrane stability and membrane fragmentation.</p><p>A good example of this is the thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), in which small vessel microthrombi create extremely tortuous passages. Although RBCs have an optimized <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio and deformability that is adequate for normal circulation, they are unable to deform adequately to traverse these microthrombi. As a result, they become mechanically sheared, producing schistocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81610\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81610 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 \">picture 10</a>) on the peripheral blood smear.

The biconcave disc shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F117123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117123 \">picture 2</a>) and cytoplasmic viscosity of the RBC optimize deformability and stability of the RBC membrane to prevent hemolysis during these deformations. The three main determinants of deformability are the ratio of membrane to cytoplasm (ie, the surface area to volume <span class=\"nowrap\">[SA/V]</span> ratio), cytoplasmic viscosity (mainly determined by mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]), and membrane properties. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'RBC shape and deformability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plasma membrane of the RBC is a continuous sheet-like membrane that envelops the cellular contents. It consists of a complex, ordered array of lipids (approximately one billion molecules) and proteins (approximately 10 million molecules) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115345\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115345 \">table 1</a>) in an extraordinarily thin (6 to 10 nm) lipid bilayer punctuated by penetrating or attached proteins (referred to as integral membrane proteins and peripheral membrane proteins, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79183 \">figure 2</a>). These lipids and proteins maintain a striking degree of asymmetry that allows ions, nutrients, and regulatory signals to enter the cell, at times against a concentration gradient. (See <a href=\"#H2387590251\" class=\"local\">'Structural organization and dynamic regulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RBC plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer with inner and outer leaflets. Its major components are unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids. The outer leaflet contains mostly uncharged phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine [PC] and sphingomyelin [SM]), and the inner leaflet contains mostly charged phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine [PE] and phosphatidylserine [PS]). Plasma cholesterol exchanges with membrane cholesterol, and membrane cholesterol regulates the activity of a &quot;flippase&quot; that maintains the asymmetry of the phospholipids. (See <a href=\"#H2063750503\" class=\"local\">'Lipid bilayer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integral membrane proteins are tightly embedded in the membrane through hydrophobic interactions with the lipids in the bilayer. Band 3 (the anion exchanger), aquaporin-1 (the water channel), glut-1 (glucose transporter), and glycophorins are the most abundant proteins of this class. Carbohydrates in the glycophorins impart a strong net negative charge to the cell surface, important in reducing the interaction of RBCs with each other and with the vascular endothelium. (See <a href=\"#H836884237\" class=\"local\">'Integral membrane proteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral membrane proteins are on the cytoplasmic surface of the lipid bilayer and are attached to the integral membrane proteins rather than to the membrane itself. Some of the most abundant and best characterized of these include spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.2, actin, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, protein 4.1, adducin, and dematin. Their principal function is thought to be related to structure, elasticity, and mechanical stability of the membrane and the geometry of the cell rather than transport of solutes or other molecules across the membrane. These proteins form an irregular network in which the basic unit is a hexagonal lattice of spectrin molecules. Ankyrin provides the major connection to the integral membrane proteins via interaction with band 3. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral membrane proteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that interfere with normal membrane deformability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stability can reduce the normal <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio, alter RBC shape, and reduce the lifespan of the RBC (ie, cause hemolysis). Inherited hemolytic anemias with decreased membrane stability include hereditary spherocytosis (HS; due to mutations affecting spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.2, or Rh-associated glycoprotein [RhAG]), some forms of hereditary elliptocytosis (HE; due to mutations affecting spectrin, protein 4.1, or the cytoplasmic tail of band 3), and some forms of hereditary stomatocytosis (HSt; due to mutations affecting cell volume or viscosity). Autoimmune hemolysis and membrane damage due to precipitated hemoglobins may also reduce the <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio and lead to hemolysis due to adverse effects on membrane stability. In thrombotic microangiopathies, RBC membrane stability is normal but the constraints of the vasculature result in membrane failure.
