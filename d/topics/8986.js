The World Health organization (WHO), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the United States Preventive Services Task Force all recommend breastfeeding for the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, the Goals for Healthy People 2020 include the initiation of breastfeeding in 82 percent of newborns, and any continued breastfeeding in 61 percent of six month old infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Successful achievement of these goals is dependent upon health care professionals providing antenatal and postnatal breastfeeding education and support. In particular, the delivery and hospital experience should promote and support initiation of breastfeeding to enhance the probability of successful breastfeeding. As the leader of the health care team, the pediatrician should advocate for breastfeeding, convey its importance as a health care issue and not a lifestyle choice, and be comfortable with directing its assessment and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. </p><p>The initiation of breastfeeding during the birth hospitalization will be reviewed here.

Studies have demonstrated that breastfeeding support interventions are associated with increased exclusive breastfeeding rates in infants during their birth hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/7,9,10,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10,18,19</a>], and at 6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>] and 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Hospital policies have a major role in the success of breastfeeding. One study reported that 67 percent of mothers whose intention was to breastfeed exclusively were not successful in reaching this goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Reasons cited for not meeting their goals included hospital supplementation with formula and lack of skin-to-skin contact in the delivery room. Another study of mothers who intended to exclusively breastfeed reported that in-hospital formula use was associated with an increased risk of breastfeeding cessation within the first two months after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A majority of birth facilities in the United States continue to have clinical practices that interfere with breastfeeding, such as limiting duration of suckling at each breastfeeding session, pacifier use, or supplementation of something other than breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some hospitals distribute gift bags containing infant formula samples, although this practice has been banned in some states. However, an increasing number of birth facilities are implementing all of the Ten Steps and earning the &quot;Baby Friendly Hospital&quot; designation. As of 2017, 22 percent of infants were born in a birth facility with this designation, compared with 3 percent in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>In order to increase breastfeeding rates, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) have recommended that all birthing centers adopt care practices similar to those of the <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/UNICEF</span> Baby-Friendly criteria that include a written policy (recommending early initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding, and restricting supplementation and pacifier use), and required education and training of all professional staff to implement the written policy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The Joint Commission on hospital accreditation requires hospitals to report their rates of exclusive breastfeeding as part of the Perinatal Care Core Measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DELIVERY ROOM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after birth, the infant should be given to the mother for skin-to-skin contact, unless there are medical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. Physical contact between the mother and the infant in the immediate postpartum period, and contact between the infant's lips and the nipple are associated with increased initiation and duration of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding should be started as soon after birth as possible, preferably within the first hour after delivery. Professional staff should be available to instruct and observe closely during this period of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding, ensuring safe positioning of the infant, and that the face is clear and airway is not obstructed. Mother-infant dyads with risk factors for possible collapse or falls in the immediate postpartum period should be identified and monitored closely by staff during early breastfeeding. Risk factors include low apgar scores, difficult delivery, and excessively sleepy or medicated mothers or newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Weighing, measuring, and routine care for the infant should be delayed until the first feeding is completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The infant should stay with the mother through recovery and room-in with the mother to enhance infant-maternal bonding and to facilitate subsequent feedings, which should be on demand. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Demand feeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18294243\"><span class=\"h2\">Cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence that the initiation rates of breastfeeding are lower in infants born by cesarean delivery compared with those born vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In a meta-analysis, the rate of initiating breastfeeding was lower after cesarean versus vaginal delivery (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.50-0.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of breastfeeding at six months of age between infants born by vaginal and cesarean delivery.</p><p>In this systemic review, a subgroup analysis suggested that the decrease in early breastfeeding was primarily due to infants delivered by elective cesarean delivery, as infants born by emergency caesarean delivery had comparable rates of breastfeeding initiation to those delivered vaginally. Similar results were noted in an Italian multicenter study, which reported exclusive formula use in 7, 8, and 19 percent of infants born by vaginal, emergency cesarean, and elective cesarean delivery, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In contrast, a population-based study from Ontario, Canada, found that breastfeeding was less common for both infants born by elective (50 percent) and nonelective cesarean delivery (48 percent) compared with vaginal delivery (68 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>General anesthesia for cesarean delivery and some types of analgesia may decrease alertness of the infant and interfere with initiation of nursing; however, this is an infrequent problem, as most cesarean deliveries are performed under regional anesthesia. Most infants delivered by cesarean delivery can be given to their mother for skin-to-skin contact in the operating room. Mothers who undergo cesarean delivery may need additional help from the clinical staff to attain comfortable and correct positioning of their infant for breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF POSTPARTUM CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpartum care of breastfeeding infants includes parental education and support, assessing the adequacy of breastfeeding, and identifying any problems of breastfeeding. Postnatal educational and support programs that promote breastfeeding should be provided to parents, before and during the birth hospitalization, and after discharge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding: Parental education and support&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the hospitalization, the initiation of breastfeeding is monitored by assessing the maternal progression of lactogenesis and the infant's intake. Mothers are instructed and evaluated on positioning of their infant, obtaining an adequate latch-on and milk transfer, recognizing their infant's feeding cues and signs of satiety, and assessing their infant's intake. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Feeding on demand is dependent upon continuous rooming-in, which allows mothers and infants to remain together at all times. The infant should always be transferred to a nearby separate sleep surface (side-car or bassinet) for sleeping, as outlined in a policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This enhances safety during the hospital stay, when the mother may be exhausted, and also models safe sleep practices that reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after hospital discharge. Problems identified in the hospital should be addressed at that time, and a documented plan for management after discharge should be communicated to both the parents and primary care provider. At discharge, a primary care appointment should be scheduled and postdischarge lactation resources provided. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mechanics of feeding'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Demand feeding'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of intake'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the birth hospitalization, the infant-mother dyad should be evaluated 24 to 48 hours after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. At that visit, assessment should include weight measurement, examination for any evidence of jaundice or dehydration, review of intake (ie, history of urine and stool output, and frequency and duration of feeding), maternal history for breast problems (eg, breast pain), and provision of additional lactation support <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resources to the parents as needed. If possible, observation of breastfeeding including position, latch, and milk transfer is desirable, and should be done if there are concerns for inadequate breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mechanics of feeding'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANICS OF FEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New mothers, especially those who have never breastfed, should receive instructions from a trained professional on the mechanics of breastfeeding that include positioning the infant, latch-on, and milk transfer. During the hospitalization, documentation of assessment by a trained observer addressing the various mechanics of breastfeeding and monitoring the progression of lactogenesis should be performed each shift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The department of pediatrics at Stanford School of medicine provides an excellent on-line guide for new mothers on the mechanics of breastfeeding (<a href=\"http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/ABCs.html&amp;token=AvplloMsfmmCYTs++o0Z5ZF+QenbUWoDYdzMTzOD/+pT/LZUkZdXxlTKY34CrnF6raJfkGRtDWHI1Q5zGLstNQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4986\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Stanford School of Medicine: ABCs of breastfeeding</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nursing mother must be in a comfortable position while breastfeeding her infant. To ensure proper latch-on, the infant should be positioned to face the mother's body such that the infant's mouth is opposite the mother's nipple with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> neck slightly extended and the head, shoulders, and hips in alignment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69936\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69936 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71940 \">figure 2</a>). For mothers who have undergone cesarean delivery, the &quot;football&quot; (also referred to as the clutch) and the side-by-side positions may be preferred as they avoid contact with the surgical incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70124 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53668\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53668 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The &quot;football&quot; position also is often used in preterm infants, because it allows for good control of the infant's head and visibility of the infant's mouth on the mother's breast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breastfeeding the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Latch-on</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latch-on refers to the formation of a tight seal of the infant's lips around the nipple and a sufficient portion of contiguous mammary tissue, which allows efficient removal of milk during nursing. Latch-on is facilitated by supporting the breast in one hand with four fingers underneath and the thumb on top of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The infant must open <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> mouth widely, and grasp the entire nipple and as much of the areola as comfortably possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112380\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112380 \">figure 4</a>). With a proper latch-on, the infant's tongue elongates the nipple and compresses the lactiferous sinuses beneath the areola against <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> hard palate, which facilitates access to milk ducts beyond the base of the nipple. The mother should feel a gentle undulating painless motion with each suck.</p><p>The appearance of an adequate latch-on includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An angle of about 120 degrees between the top and bottom lip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower lip (and, to a lesser extent, the upper lip) turned outward against the breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chin and nose in close proximity to the breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full cheeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tongue extended over the lower dental ridge and in visible contact with the breast if the lower lip is pulled away (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63201\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63201 \">figure 5</a>)</p><p/><p>Signs of poor latch-on include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact between the upper and lower lip at the corners of the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunken cheeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clicking sounds that correspond to breaking suction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tongue not visible below the nipple when the lower lip is pulled down</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creased nipple following nursing</p><p/><p>Causes of poor latch-on include breast engorgement or nipple abnormalities that prevent the infant from drawing the surrounding tissue far enough into the mouth. Problems in the infant that may contribute to poor latch-on include ankyloglossia (ie, tight frenulum), difficulties with sucking or swallowing, and neurologic complications. There are case reports that maternal nipple piercing may be associated with difficulty in latching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

It is a relatively common finding in newborns and the majority of infants with tongue-tie are able to breastfeed without difficulty. However, breastfeeding problems (eg, poor latch, maternal nipple pain) are reported more frequently among infants with ankyloglossia than without ankyloglossia. Infants who have problems with breastfeeding after lactation is established should be examined for ankyloglossia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankyloglossia-tongue-tie-in-infants-and-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Breastfeeding problems'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Inverted nipples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important not to assume that an apparently inverted or otherwise irregular nipple will interfere with breastfeeding, because infants generally are able to form a good latch-on even with the most irregularly shaped nipples. When nipple abnormalities are identified prenatally, mothers should receive lactation counseling from a qualified lactation consultant in the immediate postpartum period so that any latch problems can be addressed, and breastfeeding can be successfully initiated.</p><p>Techniques used to assist latch in such cases include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjust the infant's position to facilitate easy access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a pump or other device to draw out the nipple immediately before latch-on.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of a thin-walled nipple shield for part or the entire nursing episode may increase milk transfer and facilitates sustained breast attachment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Milk transfer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efficient transfer of milk requires coordination of suckling and swallowing. Audible swallowing is a reassuring indicator of successful milk transfer for most infants. However, it can be misleading, particularly in infants with neurologic impairment and disorganized feeding behaviors. The only reliable assessment of infant intake is a comparison of weights before and after feeding, and growth over time.</p><p>If the breast is not adequately stimulated by the infant, it is difficult to maintain the milk supply. Disorganized suckling may lead to poor growth. Signs of disorganized suckling include early release of the breast, spilling of milk from the mouth during feeding, coughing, or gagging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactogenesis takes place in two stages, secretory initiation (stage I), which occurs during the second half of pregnancy, and secretory activation (stage II), which occurs after delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;, section on 'Lactogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Stage II lactogenesis generally occurs between two and four days postpartum and is marked by the swelling of the mother's breasts and the onset of copious milk production. When the infant is nursing efficiently, the onset of stage II lactogenesis is followed rapidly by clearance of meconium and the transition to a typical mustard yellow stool.</p><p>Stage II lactogenesis may be delayed until 7 to 10 postpartum days in some women, resulting in continued infant weight loss due to decreased milk production, and is associated with an increased risk of breastfeeding failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] &#160; If lactogenesis is delayed beyond the fourth day postpartum, mother-infant dyads require careful monitoring and extra support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In general, the frequency of feeding is increased in order to facilitate lactogenesis progression. The clinician must balance the need to support the mother's continued efforts for successful breastfeeding with safeguarding her infant's health and growth. It may be necessary to provide supplemental milk (eg, bank donor milk or formula) if the infant's health is compromised by inadequate intake and efforts to improve lactation are ineffective.

Formula feeding requires additional time-consuming tasks that are not needed for breastfeeding, such as purchasing formula, preparing feeding, and washing of nipples and bottles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Nursing frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nursing frequency is variable and may be as often as every hour. The frequency of demand depends upon factors including the maternal milk supply, efficiency of milk transfer, and the ability of the infant to modulate behavioral state. In the first one to two weeks postpartum, the average frequency of breastfeeding is 8 to 12 times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Frequency and duration of feeding'</a> below.)</p><p>The healthy term infant can modulate the frequency and duration of nursing if the mother responds to the infant's cues of hunger and satiety. Thorough emptying of the breast increases the delivery of hind milk, which has high fat content and promotes rapid infant growth. Thorough emptying is also critical for promoting the progression of lactogenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;, section on 'Lactogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>During the first postpartum week or until breastfeeding is established, mothers should wake sleeping infants to nurse if four hours have elapsed since the beginning of the last feeding. This will provide a safety net for infants who do not exhibit strong hunger signals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Feeding cues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Feeding cues are behavioral changes that accompany hunger. A typical pattern of progression includes movement of the hands toward the mouth, sucking on fists and fingers, fussiness, agitation, flailing of the extremities, and, finally, loud, persistent crying. This sequence can last 45 minutes.</p><p>Infants should be fed when they demonstrate early feeding cues that include hand to mouth activity, smacking lips, rooting, and eye and extremities movements while asleep. Feeding the infant in response to early cues is optimal, especially in the first postpartum week, because it conditions the mother's let-down reflex to early hunger cues and provides an opportunity for the nursing dyad to practice latch-on and nursing skills before the baby becomes agitated. It also avoids excessive agitation and crying and, thus, minimizes early weight loss and prevents maternal anxiety.</p><p>Late hunger cues (eg, agitation, flailing of the arms and legs, and crying) may not occur in infants who are premature or ill, and lack the necessary energy reserves, or neurologic and muscular coordination. Infants who are less likely to awaken and vocalize when hungry are at risk for failure to thrive. The &quot;good&quot; newborn who sleeps long periods and rarely cries may present with poor weight gain within a few weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Signs of satiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Satiety is typically signaled by the infant's voluntary release of the nipple and relaxation of the facial muscles and hands. Infants younger than two to three months often fall asleep. Parents' assessment of satiety may be complicated by the soporific (sleepiness) effect of breastfeeding, the sensitivity of the infant's oral cavity to the nipple, and the stimulation of gastric motility by milk.</p><p>Breastfeeding is soporific, and newborns may fall asleep almost immediately after attaching to the breast. It may take several days to weeks to maintain an appropriate awake state for duration sufficient to adequately transfer milk. In these cases, adequate intake cannot be assured by behavioral assessment and must be evaluated by weight gain and signs of good hydration. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of intake'</a> below.)</p><p>An automatic suckling response is elicited as the nipple slides out of the infant's mouth. In the satiated infant, this response diminishes quickly, and the baby falls back to sleep. If the infant is not satiated, sucking intensifies, rooting behavior ensues, and the infant displays the progression of hunger cues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF INTAKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequacy of intake is based upon the frequency and duration of feeding, urine and stool output, and weight of the infant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency and duration of feeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the first postpartum week or until breastfeeding is established, mothers should nurse whenever the infant shows signs of hunger or when four hours have elapsed since the last feeding. This will usually result in 8 to 12 feedings in 24 hours. After the first week, the frequency of nursing decreases to seven to nine times per day by four weeks of age as maternal and infant nursing skills improve and milk volume increases. In one report, exclusively breastfed infants received an average of seven feedings per day at two months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The duration of a feeding also depends in part upon efficiency. The time required to transfer the same volume of milk can range from 5 to 20 minutes for different mother-infant dyads. The duration of feeding on each breast decreases with maturation. It typically falls from 10 to 15 minutes soon after birth to 8 to 10 minutes at approximately one month of age.</p><p>The maternal breastfeeding skills and comfort level, and the nursing abilities of newborns vary considerably. Thus, the assessment of appropriate frequency and duration of nursing for a mother-infant dyad depend upon the desired weight of the infant and signs of sufficient intake rather than a fixed schedule or timed feedings. In general, when milk production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infant growth are inadequate, increasing nursing frequency should be the first intervention, and is usually successful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss is normal after delivery, and the expected loss is 5 to 7 percent of birth weight. Normal infants stop losing weight by five days after birth and typically regain their birth weight by one to two weeks of age. Once breastfeeding is well-established, infants gain 15 to 40 g per day.</p><p>Curves depicting patterns of weight loss for exclusively breastfed infants during the first three days of life were developed from a study of more than 100,000 newborns in the Kaiser Permanente Health System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Key findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants born by vaginal delivery &ndash; Median percent weight loss was 4.2 percent at 24 hours, 7.1 percent at 48 hours, and 6.4 percent at 72 hours after birth.

Although the overall incidence of rehospitalization for dehydration in breastfed infants is low, ranging from 25 to 71 per 100,000 breastfed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], hypernatremic dehydration can result in life-threatening complications, such as acute renal failure, vascular thrombosis, shock, and seizures in rare cases of extreme weight loss greater than 12 percent of birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>].</p><p>Thus, for infants with an excessive weight loss (&gt;7 percent of birth weight), prompt evaluation by a knowledgeable health care provider is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

If the infant appears well, and the mother's milk production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the infant's weight have increased in the previous 24 to 48 hours, continued observation without supplemental feeding may be appropriate. This avoids the unnecessary introduction of formula supplements, which may impede milk production. However, if there is no improvement in milk production or infant weight gain, supplementation with formula may be required. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Supplementation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>If the mother feels that her breasts are inadequately emptied after breastfeeding, expression of breast milk with a breast pump can be used after each breastfeeding session. Expressed breast milk can also be fed to the infant.</p><p>In severe cases, intravenous fluids may be necessary to initially correct hypernatremia and severe hypovolemia. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 3718 infants (&lt;29 days of age) admitted to a tertiary care center between 1997 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The incidence of breastfeeding-associated hypernatremic hypovolemia due to inadequate milk intake was 1.9 percent. Three-quarters of affected infants had greater than 10 percent weight loss. Ninety percent of mothers were primiparous and were discharged within 48 hours after giving birth.

Implementation of an early weighing program between 72 and 96 hours of life resulted in earlier identification of dehydration compared with historical controls (median day of life three versus six), which was less severe with lower percentage of weight losses (11 versus 15 percent) and smaller increases of serum sodium (147 versus 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

After day four, the majority of infants have three or more stools per day, which is often timed with feeding episodes. By the fifth postpartum day, stools should be pale yellow and seedy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Lactogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>Delayed clearance of meconium indicates delayed or failed lactogenesis, poor lactation management, ineffective milk transfer, or rarely, intestinal obstruction associated with cystic fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Green frothy stools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stools that appear green and frothy sometimes occur in infants of mothers who produce copious milk and switch the infant from one breast to the other before much of the hind milk is completely extracted from the first breast. High fat content in the hind milk usually retards gut motility sufficiently so that the majority of milk lactose undergoes digestion in the small intestine. With less hind milk to slow motility, high concentrations of lactose reach the large bowel, where the action of bacterial flora creates excessive gas and frothy stools. Mothers should be advised to allow the infant to finish nursing on one breast before switching to the other, even if the child does not take the second breast.

Glucose water or sterile water feedings should not be used, as they do not provide adequate nutrition. Supplemental milk may be given by cup, bottle, syringe, or supplemental nursing system.</p><p>Any reduction in the frequency of breast emptying will decrease milk production and volume. So if the mother plans to continue breastfeeding, she should be encouraged to use a pump to empty her breasts after each nursing and each time a supplemental feeding is given. Any milk that is expressed should be fed to the infant. The additional stimulation to the breast will increase the milk supply and enhance the likelihood of successful breastfeeding.</p><p>A small study in a population of women who were highly motivated to breastfeed suggested that early limited formula supplementation can be combined with breastfeeding without having an impact on subsequent exclusive breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiation-of-breastfeeding/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
