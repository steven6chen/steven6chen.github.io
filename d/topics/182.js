Angioedema typically affects the skin or mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The swelling is self-limited, although laryngeal involvement may cause fatal asphyxiation. Clinically, this disorder is very similar to hereditary angioedema (HAE), although acquired angioedema develops in older patients and is frequently associated with underlying disease, whereas the hereditary disorder presents in younger patients who are otherwise healthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the management and prognosis of C1INH-AAE.

Upper airway angioedema usually progresses over hours, although it can occur precipitously. Intubation may become very difficult due to distortion of the anatomy of the upper airway. Because of the dangers associated with laryngeal attacks, it is important to make sure that patients are prepared to respond effectively to the development of symptoms near or in the throat.</p><p>Angioedema may also affect the gastrointestinal tract, causing colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. Episodes of abdominal angioedema are often debilitating but are not life-threatening. Angioedema affecting the skin is temporarily disfiguring but rarely dangerous unless it affects the mouth or lips, since it can compromise the airway in these situations. The approach to treating abdominal and cutaneous attacks is similar to that used in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks#H92105342\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal attacks'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks#H92105578\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous attacks'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education about laryngeal edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with C1INH-AAE must be counseled about the earliest signs of an attack affecting the upper airway, which typically includes the sensation of a lump or feeling of tightness in the throat or swallowing difficulties. Patients should also have a plan to get prompt and appropriate treatment. Any patient with throat symptoms should seek emergency care immediately. The patient should <strong>not</strong> attempt to manage early laryngeal attacks at home, although if therapy for self-administration is available and can be given quickly, the patient can initiate therapy and then call for an ambulance to take <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> to the nearest emergency department. It is important to discuss that even if the treatment has worked well in the past, the patient should always proceed immediately to an emergency care setting when the throat is involved because all of the first-line therapies take approximately 30 minutes or more to begin working. In rare circumstances, acute treatment, particularly with plasma-derived C1INH (pdC1INH), can be less effective than in hereditary C1INH deficiency, thus a second dose is occasionally required. In contrast, abdominal angioedema or cutaneous angioedema can often be managed by patients at home if they have access to acute treatments. The emergency treatments that are appropriate for administration at home are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks#H1578783276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;, section on 'Initiating treatment of acute attacks at home'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87533\"><span class=\"h2\">Written treatment plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>C1INH-AAE is a rare disorder, and few emergency department providers are familiar with the treatment. Patients can be equipped with a document that briefly explains their diagnosis, outlines the indicated treatment for acute attacks, and provides contact information for the supervising clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57664\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef57664 \">form 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management in laryngeal edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and protection of the upper airway is the first and most important management issue in the patient with an acute attack involving any part of the airway because none of the available therapies including C1INH concentrate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a> can be considered universally effective in all cases. In addition, these agents take time to work, and the patient's airway must be protected in the interim. Asphyxiation remains an important and preventable cause of death in patients with this disorder, even in settings with appropriate medications available. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Intubation should be performed immediately if stridor or signs of respiratory arrest are present. A clinician trained in difficult airway management should be summoned if possible because failed attempts can lead to fatal obstruction. Emergent cricothyroidotomy may be required in rare cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the patient is assessed and either intubated or deemed stable, additional therapies can be considered. Transfer to the intensive care unit should be arranged. Frequent and meticulous monitoring of airway status should continue throughout the course of the attack until complete resolution, and patients should not be discharged until all airway symptoms have resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic treatment of acute attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several medications available for acute treatment of episodes of angioedema due to genetic C1INH deficiency that can be used for C1INH-AAE.

As an example, one of the author's patients required multiple infusions totaling 12,000 units of pdC1INH (the usual initial dose is 1500 units) over a period of two hours to control laryngeal edema. The newer therapies for bradykinin-mediated angioedema, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a>, offer alternatives for the treatment of patients who become resistant to pdC1INH, and we would suggest trying these if resistance is suspected.

In blood samples collected from the patient described above, no significant increase of C1INH function could be detected at any point during the multiple infusions, while C1INH antigen normalized due to the increase in cleaved C1INH. These data suggest that the infused C1INH was rapidly bound by the autoantibodies and converted in its cleaved inactive form upon interaction with target proteases.

One of the author's patients had complete reversal of clinical and complement abnormalities but persistence of anti-C1INH autoantibodies. Such findings highlight the uncertainties regarding the pathogenesis of acquired angioedema.

The author has followed patients with stable MGUS for over 20 years. It is not known if treatment of MGUS prior to transformation would impact the patient's outcome. The recommendations for monitoring are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-management-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPHYLAXIS TO PREVENT ANGIOEDEMA EPISODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term prophylaxis should always be administered if intubation, oral surgery, or general surgery is planned. It is often administered prior to lesser dental procedures. Other minimally traumatic procedures not involving the oral cavity, such as a colonoscopy, may not require prophylaxis, although it is best to provide prophylaxis if the patient's tolerance to a procedure is unknown. The approach is identical to that for patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Only a few case reports describe short-term prophylaxis in patients with acquired angioedema specifically, and these have used either plasma-derived (pdC1INH) or recombinant human C1INH (rhC1INH) concentrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>The indications for long-term prophylaxis in patients with acquired angioedema are not well-defined, and guidelines remain vague. The author's approach is to initiate prophylactic therapy in patients who cannot control symptoms by &quot;on-demand therapy&quot; and experience several days of disability each month. The author also administers prophylaxis to patients in whom &quot;on-demand therapy&quot; is not entirely or consistently effective.</p><p>The options for prophylactic therapy in patients with acquired angioedema are the same as those used in HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6,20,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,25-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antifibrinolytic agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> [TA])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attenuated androgens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular infusions of C1INH concentrate</p><p/><p>However, we have concerns about the use of C1INH concentrate for prophylaxis because acquired angioedema patients sometimes become resistant to it (possibly due to anti-C1INH antibodies), and we prefer to reserve it for treating acute attacks. Whether regular C1INH infusion increase the levels of anti-C1INH autoantibody worsening disease course has not been proven, but such possibility should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H87583\" class=\"local\">'Resistance'</a> above.)</p><p>It is the author's approach to start with TA (3 grams daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If the patient's episodes of angioedema stop occurring, the dose of TA may be gradually lowered, although some patients have recurrent symptoms when this is attempted and need to remain on the full dose indefinitely. If the attacks do not decrease in number and severity on full-dose TA, the author then changes to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> (200 mg daily), adjusting to the lowest effective dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Antifibrinolytics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TA is well-tolerated by most patients with acquired angioedema and is available in many countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It became available in the United States in oral form in 2009. TA reduces the frequency and severity of attacks in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, of 13 patients treated with TA in one series, 8 responded very well and 4 responded partially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Use of TA for the prevention of angioedema, including dosing and monitoring, is discussed in more detail separately.

Until this question is conclusively answered, we coadminister antithrombotic therapy only to patients with other reasons for increased risk of thromboembolism (eg, those with malignancies, coronary heart disease, or history of thromboembolic stroke) who also need long-term TA for acquired angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. We have observed thrombotic events in four patients on antifibrinolytic agents, and the treatment was discontinued. In three of these patients, the frequency and severity of angioedema recurrences increased substantially after withdrawal of TA and could not be controlled by on-demand treatment alone or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>. Therefore, after complete recovery from the acute thrombotic events, antifibrinolytic treatment was resumed with concomitant oral anticoagulants. No further thrombotic events have occurred in these three patients using this approach for over 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3418914\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attenuated androgens, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, stanozolol, and others, control symptoms in approximately one-half of patients in our clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6,20,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,26,27</a>]. Those who respond well to this therapy sometimes achieve control of symptoms with very low doses and remain on this agent for years.

Among the 77 patients the author has followed since 1975, 16 patients have died since diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Eleven deaths were not related to C1INH-AAE, and one patient died of laryngeal edema. Three patients died from complications of the associated lymphoproliferative disease, and one died due to hemorrhagic complication of hepatitis C virus cirrhosis, possibly acquired during treatment with plasma-derived C1INH (pdC1INH) in the 1970s (when viral controls for plasma products were not available).</p><p>The risk of asphyxiation due to upper airway closure remains a real and immediate risk for patients with acquired angioedema because of the limited knowledge of this condition on the part of clinicians. In the patient who died due to laryngeal edema, an infusion of 1000 units of C1INH concentrate was started but too late to prevent progression of the swelling to airway closure. Attempts at endotracheal intubation failed because of massive laryngeal edema, and permanent anoxic brain damage was already established by the time a tracheotomy was performed. Our overall experience with 983 patients diagnosed in Italy since 1974 with C1INH-HAE indicates that 63 died, 5 of them for laryngeal edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2766642227\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
