The approach to therapy depends upon the etiology, location, and severity of the inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The management of a patient with uveitis will require consultation with an ophthalmologist or other specialist in uveal eye disease. Ideally, therapy should be initiated within 24 hours of the onset of acute, anterior uveitis, and infectious causes of uveitis should be treated promptly.</p><p>This topic will focus primarily on the treatment of uveitis that is not related to an active infection. A general approach to evaluation and treatment of the patient presenting with a painful red eye is discussed separately. Treatment of uveitis that is due to infection is discussed in more detail in topic reviews that address management of the specific infection. The etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic approach to a patient with uveitis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uvea is the middle portion of the eye. The anterior portion of the uvea includes the iris and ciliary body. The pars plana is the tissue just posterior to the ciliary body and just anterior to the retina. The posterior portion of the uvea is known as the choroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of the anterior uveal tract is called anterior uveitis and is synonymous with iritis. When the adjacent ciliary body is also inflamed, the process is known as iridocyclitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terms used to describe uveitis posterior to the lens include vitritis, intermediate uveitis, pars planitis, choroiditis, retinitis, chorioretinitis, or retinochoroiditis. Panuveitis refers to inflammation in the anterior chamber, vitreous humor, and choroid or retina simultaneously. The presence of inflammatory cells in the vitreous humor posterior to the lens is termed intermediate uveitis, even though the vitreous humor is not technically part of the uveal tract.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">UVEITIS DUE TO INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious causes of uveitis are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61247 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral infections may cause either anterior or posterior uveitis. The most common viruses causing uveitis are cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes zoster, and herpes simplex. These infections should be treated promptly with appropriate antiviral agents. CMV is being increasingly recognized in Asian populations as a cause of a chronic, unilateral anterior uveitis associated with elevated intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis, a form of chronic unilateral, primarily anterior uveitis, is now considered to be most often secondary to a remote infection with rubella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In herpetic infection of the retina, retinal destruction (acute retinal necrosis) may otherwise progress rapidly. Although immunosuppressed patients are at greater risk for acute retinal necrosis, it may also occur on occasion in patients with an intact immune system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CMV retinitis is seen only rarely in immunocompetent patients, while herpes simplex and herpes zoster may affect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to treating the underlying infection, patients with anterior uveitis due to an infection are often treated with topical glucocorticoids after initiation of antiviral medication. Treatment of ocular involvement due to these viral infections is discussed in the appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-herpes-zoster-in-the-immunocompetent-host#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host&quot;, section on 'Herpes zoster ophthalmicus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-keratitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex keratitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of chorioretinitis due to <em>Toxoplasmosis gondii</em> in patients with HIV infection and in immunocompetent adults is discussed separately. Higher doses and longer duration of treatment are generally used in patients with HIV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Chorioretinitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other treatable infectious causes of uveitis in the immunocompetent host include syphilis, and, less commonly, cat scratch fever, tuberculosis, leprosy, and Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINFECTIOUS UVEITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to treating noninfectious uveitis varies depending upon the location of the inflammation. There are limited available data from controlled trials. The following strategies are generally consistent with the approach advocated by a consensus panel of both ophthalmologists and rheumatologists that convened in 2000, prior to any extensive testing of biologic therapies, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, for uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An expert panel subsequently summarized the role of biologic therapies in the treatment of uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These are potentially complex decisions that require consultation and ongoing care with an ophthalmologist or other specialist in uveitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninfectious causes of anterior uveitis are generally treated with topical glucocorticoids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> acetate (1 percent). The frequency for the drops depends upon the intensity of the inflammation. A dilating drop such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> (0.25 percent) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclopentolate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclopentolate</a> (1 percent) can relieve pain due to spasm of the muscles controlling the pupil and will also help to prevent the formation of posterior synechiae that may interfere with the function of the pupil.</p><p>Uveitis that is primarily posterior to the lens is generally not responsive to topical medication, although some experts are increasingly using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=difluprednate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">difluprednate</a> (0.05 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Difluprednate has better vitreous humor penetration for inflammation posterior to the lens compared with other topical corticosteroids, but it also has a greater tendency to raise intraocular pressure or to cause a cataract. Additional options for initial treatment of intermediate or posterior uveitis, or of panuveitis, include observation only or treatment with periocular injection of a glucocorticoid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> (subconjunctival, subtenon, or peribulbar). Intraocular injection of glucocorticoids entails more risk than a periocular injection, but this approach can also provide more potent and more sustained benefit. Some patients, however, may decline a periocular or intraocular injection. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two glucocorticoids for intraocular injection, a formulation of triamcinolone and a polymer that slowly releases <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. Complications from glucocorticoid injections in or around the eye include glaucoma and cataractogenesis.</p><p>Systemic treatment is generally reserved for resistant inflammation and may be indicated in patients with glaucoma who cannot be treated with local injection. In addition, patients with bilateral disease are often treated with systemic therapy. Some specific forms of inflammation such as Beh&ccedil;et syndrome or serpiginous choroiditis are more likely to require systemic therapy. The approach to therapy is generally not affected by the etiology of the uveitis, but there are important exceptions. As examples, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is especially responsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]; Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease may benefit from intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> when the illness first begins, and pars planitis is often managed just by observation or periocular glucocorticoid injections to treat the complication of macular edema. One study found that interferon beta was more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> in controlling macular edema associated with intermediate uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease resistant to initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ongoing inflammation may require systemic glucocorticoid therapy or additional antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive agents, such as an antimetabolite <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a calcineurin antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>). In patients with uveitis who are resistant to such therapy, subsequent therapeutic options include a TNF inhibitor, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>; a switch to a different antimetabolite; a glucocorticoid, either regionally or orally, usually on a temporary basis; or the combination of an antimetabolite with a calcineurin antagonist. The choice between these options depends on many variables such as patient and provider preference, etiology of the uveitis, patient cost and regulatory or insurance restrictions, and the cause of any visual loss. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Antimetabolites or cytotoxic agents'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Intraocular glucocorticoid releasing implant'</a> below.)</p><p>In one study of patients with noninfectious uveitis, over half of the patients required a change in treatment after their initial course of systemic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Disease in a large majority of these patients was effectively controlled with a switch to a different immunosuppressive drug or the use of combinations of immunosuppressive agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral glucocorticoids are generally reserved for patients with bilateral disease that has not responded to topical medications and that is interfering with the activities of daily living. A risk-benefit ratio must be considered for any therapeutic decision. Some patients function well with a visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/70,</span> while others are functionally impaired with a visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span>.</p><p>Toxicity related to oral glucocorticoid use may limit acceptance by patients. Body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, bone mineral density, and lipids should be monitored if patients require chronic oral glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of glucocorticoid therapy is not to cure but to limit the inflammation. Many forms of uveitis that are severe enough to warrant oral glucocorticoid or other immunosuppressive drugs are chronic, such as sarcoidosis. Thus, the clinician should strive to use the lowest dose of medication that provides acceptable benefit. The dose of oral glucocorticoid varies based on the underlying disease, the disease severity, the patient profile, and the clinician and patient preference. A common initial dose is the equivalent of 40 to 60 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> per day, with gradual tapering after response to the lowest dose that controls inflammation.</p><p>If remission has been achieved for 6 to 12 months, the maintenance dose of glucocorticoid may be gradually discontinued. A shorter course of therapy is usually sufficient in patients with severe iritis associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 spectrum of spondyloarthritis. It is rarely necessary to treat such patients with oral therapy for more than two weeks because the eye inflammation generally remits spontaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Antimetabolites or cytotoxic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small percentage of patients with uveitis may require immunosuppressive medications. Indications for their use include bilateral disease, active inflammation, failure to respond to oral glucocorticoid therapy, or severe disease that interferes with activities of daily living. Additionally, patients who require a daily dose of 10 mg or more of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> to control their ocular inflammation may benefit from a glucocorticoid-sparing agent, such as an antimetabolite, as a safer long-term alternative. This recommendation is consistent with the consensus of a group of international experts on uveitis management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, or a calcineurin antagonist, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, rather than a TNF inhibitor because of concerns regarding cost and toxicity of the biologic agent.</p><p>Immunosuppressive agents that may be employed include antimetabolites, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; calcineurin inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>; or alkylating agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. These medications should be used with appropriate caution and careful monitoring. There should be no specific contraindication to the therapy, such as active liver disease when using methotrexate, or hypertension or renal disease when using cyclosporine.

In patients with intermediate <span class=\"nowrap\">uveitis/pars</span> planitis, we obtain baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before starting a TNF inhibitor because of the association of such findings with demyelinating disease.</p><p>Two well-designed, randomized trials showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> was effective in the treatment of noninfectious intermediate, posterior, and pan-uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In these trials, adalimumab significantly improved the time-to-treatment failure in patients with uveitis who followed a tapering schedule for oral glucocorticoids. In mid-2016, both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA recommended approval of adalimumab for adults with these forms of uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence supporting the use of TNF inhibitors for uveitis includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the SYCAMORE trial demonstrated benefit from the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> to ongoing therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> in children with active uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this 18-month trial involving 90 patients, therapy with methotrexate was continued, and patients were randomly assigned to also receive adalimumab or placebo. The addition of adalimumab delayed the time to treatment failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0.25, 95% CI 0.12-0.49), which was less frequent in the adalimumab-treated patients (27 versus 60 percent). The median time to failure was not reached in the adalimumab group during the trial period but was 24.1 weeks with placebo. Enrollment in the trial was stopped early due to the degree of benefit. Serious adverse events were more common in patients receiving adalimumab (0.29 versus 0.19 events per patient-year).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response of uveitis associated with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> has been encouraging in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/7-10,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10,22-24</a>].

Alpha interferon requires frequent injections and its use is associated with flu-like symptoms and depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-behcet-syndrome#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;, section on 'Posterior uveitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of recurrent episodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several small studies have found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> can help prevent attacks of HLA-B27-associated iritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. This prophylactic approach is appropriate for patients whose attacks are especially frequent or severe. TNF inhibitors are highly effective in reducing the frequency of HLA-B27-associated iritis, but the risk and cost usually do not justify their use if the purpose is solely to prevent iritis. Some evidence also indicates that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could reduce the frequency of iritis attacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76270008\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prognosis varies depending upon the etiology and severity of the uveitis. In patients with new-onset anterior uveitis, factors associated with a lower rate of medication-free remission and persistent inflammation include diagnosis with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, bilateral uveitis, history of cataract surgery, and findings at presentation of either 1+ or greater vitreous cells or visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span> or worse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Uveitis (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorioretinitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Chorioretinitis (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal management of a patient with uveitis will require consultation with an ophthalmologist or other specialist in eye disease. Ideally, therapy should be initiated within 24 hours of the onset of acute, anterior uveitis, and most infectious causes of uveitis should be treated promptly. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of uveitis due to an infectious agent is directed toward the responsible organism. Infection with herpes simplex or herpes zoster may cause retinal destruction (acute retinal necrosis). Antiviral therapy is especially important in the setting of retinitis in order to limit retinal damage. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Uveitis due to infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis is generally classified as anterior, intermediate, or posterior or as panuveitis (involving all anatomic segments of the uveal tract). Anterior uveitis not due to infection is treated with topical glucocorticoids. Dilating ophthalmic drops are indicated if ciliary spasm is causing pain or if there is risk for posterior synechiae. Posterior or intermediate uveitis and panuveitis are generally not responsive to topical treatment. Initial management of uveitis posterior to the lens usually includes observation, as well as periocular and, occasionally, intraocular glucocorticoid injections. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral glucocorticoids are frequently recommended for patients with uveitis that is resistant to topical therapy. Other immunomodulatory agents are suggested in patients who have active inflammation that interferes with activities of daily living and who have one of the following indications (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Disease resistant to initial treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Refractory uveitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drug-related adverse effects from systemic glucocorticoids or persistent requirement for a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or equivalent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intraocular fluocinolone-releasing implant offers an alternative to systemic therapy, but it may necessitate multiple surgeries for its complications (cataract and glaucoma) and its long-term safety has not been fully studied. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Intraocular glucocorticoid releasing implant'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uveitis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Smith JR, Rosenbaum JT.
