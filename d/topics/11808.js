The cramps can wake you up from sleep. They can last for many minutes or just a few seconds.</p><p>Nighttime leg cramps are common in both adults and children. But as people get older, they are more likely to get them. About half of people older than 50 get nighttime leg cramps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18244660\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes nighttime leg cramps?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most nighttime leg cramps do not have a cause that doctors can find. When doctors do find causes, the causes can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a leg or foot structure that is different from normal &ndash; For example, having flat feet or a knee that bends in the wrong direction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sitting in an awkward position or sitting too long in one position</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standing or walking a lot on concrete floors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in your body's fluid balance &ndash; This can happen if you:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Take medicines called diuretics (also called &quot;water pills&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Are on dialysis (a kind of treatment for kidney disease)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sweat too much</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercising</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having certain conditions &ndash; For example, Parkinson disease, diabetes, or low thyroid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being pregnant &ndash; Some pregnant women do not have enough of the mineral magnesium in their blood. This can cause leg cramps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking certain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18244675\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Things you can try include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Riding a stationary bike for a few minutes before bed &ndash; If you normally get little exercise, this might help.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doing stretching exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63450\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63450 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing shoes with firm support, especially at the back of your foot around your heel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping bed covers loose at the foot of your bed and NOT tucked in</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking plenty of water, especially if you take diuretics. (Do this only if your doctor or nurse has not told you to limit the amount of water you drink.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limiting the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staying cool when you exercise, and NOT exercising in very hot weather or hot rooms</p><p/><p>If you get a cramp, slowly stretch the cramped muscle. To prevent more cramps, you can try:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking around or jiggling your leg or foot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lying down with your legs and feet up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking a hot shower with water spraying on the cramp for 5 minutes, or taking a warm bath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rubbing the cramp with ice wrapped in a towel</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18244690\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You wake up several times a night with leg cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your cramps keep you from getting enough sleep </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your cramps are very painful</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have cramps in other parts of your body, such as your upper back or belly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18244705\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you about your symptoms and do an exam to find out what could be causing your nighttime leg cramps. Depending on your symptoms and exam, you might also need some blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18244720\"><span class=\"h1\">How are nighttime leg cramps treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is different for everyone. Most people have to try a few different things before they find a treatment that helps them.</p><p>Treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making lifestyle changes &ndash; For example, exercising differently, doing stretching exercises, wearing shoes with good support, or drinking enough fluids </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking supplements &ndash; Supplements are pills, capsules, liquids, or tablets with minerals or vitamins your body needs. Tell your doctor or nurse about any minerals, vitamins, or herbal medicines you already take.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping any medicines you take that could cause cramps. But do not stop taking any medicine unless your doctor or nurse says it is OK.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines - Taking prescription medicines that improve sleep, relax muscles, calm overactive nerves, or help in other ways.

Talk to your child's doctor or nurse if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has leg cramps often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot sleep well because of leg cramps</p><p/><p>Nocturnal leg cramps can run in families.
