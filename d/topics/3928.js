Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) represents approximately one-third of aortic aneurysm admissions, with the remainder of cases related to abdominal aortic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of TAAs is lower than the reported prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), but unlike AAA, which appears to be decreasing, the incidence of TAA is increasing. Enlargement of the thoracic aorta is an increasingly recognized condition that is diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies performed to evaluate unrelated conditions.</p><p>Most patients with TAA have no symptoms. Aneurysms that produce symptoms are typically very large and are at an increased risk for rupture, which is associated with high mortality rates. When symptoms do occur, patients can present with chest or upper back pain, or with symptoms related to compression of surrounding structures leading to nerve dysfunction, or arterial compression causing ischemia or thromboembolism.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features and diagnosis of TAA. Pseudoaneurysm (false aneurysm) represents a collection of blood and connective tissue outside the aortic wall, the result of a contained aortic rupture, which may be due to one of a variety of pathologic processes such as penetrating aortic ulcer, aortic dissection, blunt aortic injury, or other acute aortic syndromes. These disorders are discussed elsewhere.

It originates immediately beyond the aortic valve and ascends initially, then curves, forming the aortic arch, and descends caudally adjacent to the spine. The ascending thoracic aorta gives off the coronary arteries, and the aortic arch branches are typically the brachiocephalic trunk (branches to the right carotid and right subclavian arteries), left carotid, and left subclavian arteries; however, aortic arch anatomy can vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54048\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54048 \">figure 1</a>). The descending thoracic aorta provides paired thoracic arteries (T1-T12) and continues through the hiatus of the diaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86026%7ESURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86026 graphicRef51087 \">figure 2A-B</a>) to become the abdominal aorta, which extends retroperitoneally to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058418009\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of TAA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A true aneurysm is defined as a segmental full-thickness dilation of a blood vessel having at least a 50 percent increase in diameter compared with the expected normal diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Other symptoms depend upon the location of the aneurysm.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic arch &ndash; Ascending aneurysms can present with heart failure due to aortic regurgitation from aortic sinus dilatation and annular distortion.

These studies may help guide management of the patient diagnosed with TAA. In patients who present with systemic manifestations (eg, fever, weight loss), an elevated white blood cell count may indicate aortic infection or inflammation, and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (elevated D-dimer) can be related to a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93764\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93764 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Anemia may point toward acute blood loss as the cause of shock, and elevated lactic acid levels help assess the severity of ischemia that may be due to TAA rupture or arterial occlusion. A negative D-dimer can be used to rule out aortic dissection in patients who present with chest pain, but it does not exclude the presence of an aneurysm.

TEE is recommended rather than TTE or cross-sectional imaging in patients with acute symptoms who are hypotensive. Provided TTE adequately visualizes the affected aortic segments, the lower cost and risk of TTE make it the most useful imaging modality for long-term monitoring.

Normal diameters for the thoracic aorta are given in the text above. Aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are classified by the segment of the aorta that is involved. (See <a href=\"#H388709911\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with thoracic aneurysms are often asymptomatic at the time of presentation. When present, symptoms are usually due to compression of adjacent structures, which may lead to chest, back, flank, or abdominal pain. Depending upon the aneurysm location, pulmonary symptoms or signs of nerve compression (eg, hoarseness, diaphragm paralysis) can also occur. Other symptoms may be due to aortic regurgitation or thromboembolism to nearly any vascular bed (eg, coronary, cerebral, renal, mesenteric, lower extremity, and, rarely, spinal cord). The most serious complications of thoracic aortic aneurysm are aortic dissection and rupture, which is most often into the left intrapleural space or intrapericardial space. Rupture is associated with severe pain and hypotension or shock. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thoracic aortic aneurysm may be suspected based upon the appearance of a routine chest radiograph. The aneurysm produces a widening of the mediastinal silhouette, enlargement of the aortic knob, or displacement of the trachea from midline. Other radiographic features include displaced calcification, aortic kinking, and opacification of the aorticopulmonary window. Chest radiography cannot distinguish an aneurysm from a tortuous aorta, and many aneurysms are not apparent. (See <a href=\"#H388713506\" class=\"local\">'Imaging symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomographic (CT) angiography with intravenous contrast or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the tests of choice to detect a thoracic aortic aneurysm, determine its size, define aortic and branch vessel anatomy, and rule out an associated dissection. MR imaging is better than CT for aneurysms involving the aortic sinuses or when avoiding intravenous contrast is necessary. Although contrast arteriography provides sharper resolution of luminal characteristics and is the best method for evaluating branch vessel pathology, this procedure is invasive, is unable to determine the true aneurysm diameter, and has the potential for nephrotoxicity from contrast medium. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with known bicuspid aortic valves, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed to assess the diameters of the aortic sinuses and the ascending aorta, which, if greater than 4.0 cm (lower threshold for smaller stature), indicate the need for serial evaluation of aortic sinuses and ascending aortic size and morphology annually by echocardiography, CT, or MR. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is preferred over TTE for examination of the entire aorta, particularly in emergency situations and for imaging when coexistent dissection is suspected. TEE may also augment the examination of TTE if the examination is incomplete or additional information is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3151470395\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
