By contrast, verbal aggression and threats, or physical aggression directed towards property, animals, or other individuals that does not result in physical damage or injury (ie, low intensity aggression), occurs twice weekly on average for at least three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A nationally representative survey in the United States found that among 463 individuals with a lifetime history of intermittent explosive disorder, the mean number of physical (high plus low intensity) and verbal outbursts at the height of the illness was 28 per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Signs of generalized aggressiveness may occur in between explosive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>].

Multiple studies from the same research group presented vignettes of ambiguous, nonthreatening social interactions to individuals with intermittent explosive disorder, individuals with other psychiatric disorders (eg, depressive disorders or substance use disorders), and healthy controls, and found that those with intermittent explosive disorder were less able to absorb (encode) socially relevant information, compared with each control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Those with intermittent explosive disorder were also more likely to misinterpret others&rsquo; behavior and make hostile attributions about the intentions of others, compared with each control group, and were more likely to respond with negative emotions and to take a more favorable view of aggressive behavior. In addition, strategic emotional intelligence (the ability to understand what one is feeling and to use that information for self-management) is lower in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder, compared with healthy controls and psychiatric controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; this deficit is likely related to abnormalities in social-emotional information processing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2259399766\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent explosive disorder is usually associated with psychosocial impairment, including interpersonal difficulties, divorce, job loss, school suspension, and financial problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20,21</a>]. Other adverse consequences include hospitalization because of injuries suffered in fights, legal charges, and incarceration. In a cross-national study of community surveys from 16 countries that identified approximately 350 individuals with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder in the past 12 months, severe impairment in at least one domain of functioning was reported by nearly 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Although intermittent explosive disorder is not diagnosed if the impulsive, aggressive behavior occurs only in the context of a different, active psychiatric disorder or an active, general medical disorder, several exceptions exist such that recurrent, severe aggressive behavior that requires independent clinical attention can be diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder in the context of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, or autism spectrum disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The co-occurrence of intermittent explosive disorder and bipolar disorder has been obscured in many epidemiologic studies because patients with bipolar disorder were not permitted to receive a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder due to the symptomatic overlap between the two conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Other studies indicate that among individuals with intermittent explosive disorder, comorbid personality disorders are common, especially cluster B disorders (eg, borderline personality disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,27</a>].

By contrast, intermittent explosive disorder typically does not present with delusions and hallucinations, and is not characterized by other signs of psychosis (eg, disorganized speech and behavior and affective flattening).

In addition, the aggressive episodes of intermittent explosive disorder generally last minutes to hours, whereas hypomanic and manic episodes generally last days to months. Bipolar major depression is distinguished by anergia, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, and psychomotor retardation; these symptoms usually do not occur in intermittent explosive disorder.

In addition, the aggressive behavior in antisocial personality disorder is often premeditated and instrumental in the sense that the aggressive behavior is part of a plan to gain an advantage (eg, power or money) and intimidate others; this is not the case in intermittent explosive disorder.
