Calcium in the blood is transported partly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 45 percent), notably albumin; partly bound to small anions such as phosphate and citrate (approximately 15 percent); and partly in the free or ionized state (approximately 40 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although only the ionized calcium is metabolically active (ie, subject to transport into cells), most laboratories report total serum calcium concentrations. Concentrations of total calcium in normal serum generally range between 8.5 and 10.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.12 to 2.62 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and levels below this are considered to be consistent with hypocalcemia. The normal range of ionized calcium is 4.65 to 5.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.16 to 1.31 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoalbuminemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When protein concentrations (particularly albumin) fluctuate substantially, total calcium levels may vary, whereas the ionized calcium (whose level is hormonally regulated) remains relatively stable. Thus, total serum calcium concentrations may not accurately reflect the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium concentration. As an example, in volume overload, chronic illness, and malnutrition or nephrotic syndrome (where serum protein can be reduced), total plasma calcium is low but the ionized calcium is normal. This phenomenon is called pseudohypocalcemia.</p><p>The serum total calcium concentration falls approximately 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> reduction in the serum albumin concentration. Thus, in patients with hypoalbuminemia, the measured serum calcium concentration should be corrected for the abnormality in albumin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), or for standard units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). If a laboratory known to measure ionized calcium reliably is available, some authorities prefer to measure the serum ionized calcium in this situation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid-base disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even in the presence of a normal serum albumin, changes in blood pH can alter the equilibrium constant of the albumin-calcium complex, with acidosis reducing the binding and alkalosis enhancing it. Thus, in critically ill or postsurgical patients, correcting total calcium for albumin is not necessarily accurate because of changes in pH and affinity of calcium binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one study, for example, the use of the formula that corrected the calcium concentration based upon albumin level had a sensitivity of only 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Consequently, when major shifts in pH are present, it is most prudent to directly measure the ionized calcium level in order to determine the presence of hypocalcemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormone regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major hormones that regulate serum calcium are parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D via effects on bone, kidney, and the gastrointestinal tract. Calcium itself acts to regulate its own blood levels by acting via a calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the parathyroid gland to inhibit PTH secretion and on a CaSR in the loop of Henle to stimulate renal calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>PTH is secreted almost instantaneously in response to very small reductions in serum ionized calcium, which are sensed by the CaSR. The increase in PTH release raises the serum calcium concentration toward normal via three actions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased urinary calcium excretion due to stimulation of calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intestinal calcium absorption mediated by increased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), the most active form of vitamin D</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased bone resorption</p><p/><p>Hypocalcemia may occur when PTH secretion is insufficient to act on kidney, bone, and intestine to normalize serum calcium (hypoparathyroidism). When the parathyroid glands and PTH are functioning normally, then other causes of hypocalcemia, such as vitamin D deficiency, are characterized by high PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Thus, it is useful to characterize hypocalcemia broadly as associated with low PTH or high PTH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62899 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOCALCEMIA WITH LOW PTH (HYPOPARATHYROIDISM)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypocalcemia with low parathyroid hormone (PTH) occurs when there is decreased secretion of PTH due to destruction of the parathyroid glands (autoimmune, postsurgical), abnormal parathyroid gland development, or altered regulation of PTH production and secretion. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is surgical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Destruction of the parathyroid glands</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical hypoparathyroidism can occur after thyroid, parathyroid, or radical neck surgery for head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It may be transient, with recovery in days, weeks or months; permanent; or even intermittent. Transient hypoparathyroidism may be due to manipulation of the blood supply to or removal of one or more parathyroid glands during surgery, whereas intermittent hypoparathyroidism is due to decreased parathyroid reserve.</p><p>Transient hypoparathyroidism occurs in up to 20 percent of patients after surgery for thyroid cancer and permanent hypoparathyroidism occurs in 0.8 to 3.0 percent of patients after total thyroidectomy, particularly when the goiter is extensive and anatomic landmarks are displaced and obscured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-surgical-treatment#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Hypoparathyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>Hypoparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy also may be transient, resulting from suppression of the remaining parathyroid tissue by prior hypercalcemia, or it may be severe and prolonged, accompanied by hypophosphatemia, as in the hungry bone syndrome. Hypocalcemia due to hungry bone syndrome may persist despite recovery of PTH secretion from the remaining normal glands. Thus, serum PTH concentrations may be low, normal, or even elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hungry-bone-syndrome-following-parathyroidectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hungry bone syndrome following parathyroidectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoimmune</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired hypoparathyroidism not related to surgery is most often an autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Permanent hypoparathyroidism can result from immune-mediated destruction of the parathyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Alternatively, hypoparathyroidism may result from activating antibodies to the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) that decrease PTH secretion. The antibodies are not destructive and may remit spontaneously. Activating antibodies to the CaSR have been reported in patients with isolated acquired hypoparathyroidism and in patients with hypoparathyroidism associated with polyglandular autoimmune syndromes.

This syndrome typically presents in childhood with candidiasis, followed several years later by hypoparathyroidism, and then adrenal insufficiency during adolescence.

Symptomatic hypoparathyroidism has also been described in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

The latter has been associated with mutations in the transcription factor glial-cell missing B (GCMB). In addition, hypoparathyroidism may be associated with complex congenital syndromes (eg, DiGeorge syndrome).

In contrast to other causes of hypocalcemia, urinary calcium excretion is normal or high, presumably due to increased activation of the CaSR in the kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;, section on 'Hypoparathyroidism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;, section on 'Acquired disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, functional hypoparathyroidism can be caused by both hypomagnesemia and by acute severe hypermagnesemia.

In these cases, PTH is increased in response to low serum calcium concentrations, in an attempt to mobilize calcium from kidney and bone and to increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production. Chronic hypocalcemia occurs when these actions are inadequate to restore the serum calcium to normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9137630\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D deficiency or resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased production or action of vitamin D may cause hypocalcemia with a high PTH. Causes of vitamin D deficiency include poor intake or malabsorption coupled with reduced exposure to ultraviolet light, decreased 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D to form calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) in the liver, increased metabolism to inactive metabolites, decreased 1-hydroxylation of calcidiol to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) in the kidney, and decreased calcitriol action.

In contrast to other forms of hypocalcemia associated with vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia in CKD is also due to the occurrence of hyperphosphatemia (due to reduction in the filtered phosphate load and a reduction in the fractional excretion of phosphorus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
