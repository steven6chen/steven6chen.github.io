An overview of thyroid physiology and disease during pregnancy is presented here. Some of the disorders reviewed below are discussed separately in individual topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID ADAPTATION DURING NORMAL PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of thyroid disease during pregnancy requires an understanding of the changes in thyroid physiology and thyroid function tests that accompany normal pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1156377\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To meet the increased metabolic needs during a normal pregnancy, there are changes in thyroid physiology that are reflected in altered thyroid function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The major changes in thyroid function during pregnancy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of the thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) receptor by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H994015\"><span class=\"h3\">Thyroxine-binding globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, serum TBG concentrations rise almost twofold because estrogen increases TBG production and TBG sialylation, which results in decreased clearance of TBG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. To maintain adequate free thyroid hormone concentrations during this period, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) production by the thyroid gland must increase. The TBG excess leads to an increase in both serum total, but not free, T4 and T3 concentrations. Levels of total T4 and T3 rise by approximately 50 percent during the first half of pregnancy, plateauing at approximately 20 weeks of gestation, at which time a new steady state is reached and the overall production rate of thyroid hormones returns to prepregnancy rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H994022\"><span class=\"h3\">hCG and thyroid function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is one of a family of glycoprotein hormones, including TSH, with a common alpha subunit and a unique beta subunit. However, there is considerable homology between the beta subunits of hCG and TSH. As a result, hCG has weak thyroid-stimulating activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a human thyroid cell culture assay, as an example, 1 microU of hCG was equivalent to 0.0013 microU of TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Serum hCG concentrations increase soon after fertilization and peak at 10 to 12 weeks. During this peak, total serum T4 and T3 concentrations increase. Serum free T4 and T3 concentrations increase slightly, usually within the normal range, and serum TSH concentrations are appropriately reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in 10 to 20 percent of normal women, serum TSH concentrations are transiently low or undetectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In a report of 63 women with extremely high hCG concentrations (&gt;200,000 international units per L), TSH was &lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">microU/mL</span> in 67 percent of samples, and free T4 was above 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> in 32 percent of samples. All women whose hCG was greater than 400,000 international units per L had a suppressed TSH concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Very high levels of hCG can be seen in multiple pregnancies (ie, twins, triplets, etc) and in hyperemesis gravidarum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes#H12187099\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes&quot;, section on 'hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>This transient, usually subclinical, hyperthyroidism should be considered a normal physiologic finding. It is not known if this action of hCG benefits the mother or fetus. Later in pregnancy, as hCG secretion declines, serum free T4 and T3 concentrations decline, and serum TSH concentrations rise slightly to or within the normal range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1156384\"><span class=\"h2\">Trimester-specific reference ranges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the changes in thyroid physiology during pregnancy, the Guidelines of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease during Pregnancy and the Postpartum recommend using population-based, trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH and assay method and trimester-specific reference ranges for serum free T4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Unfortunately, many commercial laboratories currently do not provide these reference ranges. When trimester-specific reference ranges for free T4 are not available and free T4 levels appear discordant with TSH, measurement of total T4 may be superior to free T4. (See <a href=\"#H4228306818\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of thyroid function'</a> below.)</p><p>In the absence of population and trimester-specific normal ranges, ATA guidelines suggest the following for interpretation of thyroid function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weeks 7 to 12 &ndash; Reduce the lower limit of the reference range of TSH by approximately 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> and the upper limit by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> (corresponding to a TSH reference range of approximately 0.1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second and third trimester &ndash; There should be a gradual return of TSH towards the nonpregnant normal range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper reference range for total T4 increases by approximately 5 percent per week, beginning at week 7. At approximately 16 weeks, total T4 (and T3) levels during pregnancy are 1.5-fold higher than in nonpregnant women (due to TBG excess).</p><p/><p>The extent of the downward shift in the reference range for TSH during pregnancy varies with different racial and ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one of the largest population-based studies (over 13,000 pregnant women), the reference range (2.5<sup>th</sup> to 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile) for TSH in the first trimester was 0.08 to 2.99 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, other studies in different populations suggest a more modest reduction in the upper limit of normal of TSH of only 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In several population studies, the lower limit of the reference range for TSH in healthy pregnant women during the first trimester ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/11,12,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,15-17</a>].</p><p>Most studies report a progressive decrease in measured free T4 during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,19</a>]. However, direct free T4 measurements may be unreliable in some patients due to changes in binding proteins during pregnancy. Measurement of free T4 in the dialysate or ultrafiltrate of serum samples using liquid <span class=\"nowrap\">chromatography/tandem</span> mass spectrometry appears to be the most reliable, and when this method is used, free T4 concentrations were shown to decrease modestly with advancing gestational age, particularly between the first and second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. This assay is relatively expensive and not universally available. Other free T4 assays (and probably free T3 assays) frequently fail to meet performance standards in pregnant patients, owing to increases in TBG and decreases in albumin concentrations that cause the immunoassay to be unreliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. To compensate, assay kits should provide different free T4 normal ranges for pregnant patients, usually lower than those of nonpregnant patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;, section on 'Serum free T4 and free T3'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4228306818\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of thyroid function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating thyroid tests during pregnancy, we typically measure TSH and free T4 (if there is a trimester-specific reference range), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T4. It is not uncommon to find free T4 levels to be at or below the reference range for nonpregnant adults in association with normal serum TSH levels, a finding related to free T4 assay inaccuracy due to changes in binding proteins. In such settings where free T4 measurements appear discordant with TSH measurements, total T4 should also be measured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1156391\"><span class=\"h2\">Iodine requirements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodine requirements are higher in pregnant than in nonpregnant women due both to the increase in maternal T4 production required to maintain maternal euthyroidism and an increase in renal iodine clearance. Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy results in a reduction in maternal T4 production, inadequate placental transfer of maternal T4, and impairment of fetal neurologic development. However, markedly excessive iodine intake may also be harmful as it can lead to fetal hypothyroidism and goiter.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 250 mcg of iodine daily during pregnancy and lactation. The National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) recommends daily iodine intake of 220 mcg during pregnancy and 290 mcg during lactation. For women in the United States to achieve this level of daily intake, the ATA recommends supplementation with 150 mcg of iodine daily during pregnancy and lactation, which is the dose included in the majority of prenatal vitamins marketed in the United States, though pregnant women should verify the iodine content in their own prenatal vitamin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;</a>). The WHO sets the tolerable upper intake amount for iodine as 500 mcg daily for pregnant women, while the National Academy of Medicine uses 1100 mcg daily for adults and pregnant women &gt;19 years of age.</p><p>Iodine requirements and the consequences of inadequate and excess intake are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H147486325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'Iodine requirements'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H59356473\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'During pregnancy and lactation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H59356843\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Iodine-induced thyroid disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID FUNCTION IN THE FETUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, fetal TSH appears, and the fetal thyroid is capable of concentrating iodine and synthesizing iodothyronines. However, little hormone synthesis occurs until the 18<sup>th</sup> to 20<sup>th</sup> week. Thereafter, fetal thyroid secretion increases gradually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>At term, fetal serum T4, T3, and TSH concentrations differ substantially from those in the mothers. Serum TSH concentrations are higher, serum free T4 concentrations are lower, and serum T3 concentrations are one-half those of the mothers. Soon after birth, serum TSH concentrations rapidly increase to 50 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> and then fall to 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> within 48 hours. Serum T3 and T4 concentrations rapidly increase to values slightly higher than those in normal adults.</p><p>The extent to which maternal thyroid hormones cross the placenta is controversial, but maternal thyroid hormones are critical for growth and development in the first trimester, when the fetus has no functional thyroid of its own. In infants with congenital absence of the thyroid, cord serum concentrations range from 20 to 50 percent of the concentrations in normal infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. TSH-receptor antibodies can cross the placenta and cause either fetal hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Fetal and neonatal Graves' disease'</a> below). Little TSH crosses the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTHYROIDISM COMPLICATING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overt hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH, elevated free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T3) is relatively uncommon during pregnancy, occurring in 0.1 to 0.4 percent of all pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although hyperthyroidism from any cause can complicate pregnancy, Graves' disease and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism are the most common causes of hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease usually becomes less severe during the later stages of pregnancy due to a reduction in TSH-receptor antibody concentrations or, rarely, mediated by a change in the activity of TSH-receptor antibodies from stimulatory to blocking. hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism usually occurs transiently in the first half of gestation and is typically less severe than Graves' disease.

If a TSH level is &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> free T4 (or free T4 index) and total T3 (or free T3) should be obtained. In the event that free thyroid hormone levels are discordant with serum TSH and clinical findings, total T4 should be measured. It should be recalled that 10 to 20 percent of normal women have a subnormal or suppressed serum TSH in the first trimester, usually in association with normal free T4 levels.</p><p>Most pregnant women with significant overt hyperthyroidism in the first trimester will have a serum TSH below that which is seen in asymptomatic, healthy pregnant women (ie, &lt;0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> associated with an elevated free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> free T3 (or total T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T3) measurement.

Treatment options for pregnant women with overt hyperthyroidism due to Graves' or nodular thyroid disease are limited because therapy may be harmful to the fetus. However, a good fetal and maternal outcome depends upon controlling the mother's hyperthyroidism. Most women are treated with thionamides. The goal of thionamides is to reduce and maintain the mother's serum free T4 concentration in the high normal range for nonpregnant women using the lowest dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The major changes in thyroid function during pregnancy are an increase in serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentrations and stimulation of the thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) receptor by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Together, these changes lead to an increase in both serum total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and a reduction in serum TSH. (See <a href=\"#H1156377\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the changes in thyroid physiology during normal pregnancy, thyroid function tests should, whenever possible, be interpreted using population and trimester-specific TSH and T4 reference ranges for pregnant women. If the laboratory does not provide trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH <span class=\"nowrap\">(mU/L),</span> a TSH reference range of approximately 0.1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> can be used. Total T4 and total T3 levels during pregnancy are 1.5-fold higher than in nonpregnant women. Reference ranges for free T4 are assay method-specific, and trimester-specific reference ranges should be provided with the assay kits. (See <a href=\"#H1156384\" class=\"local\">'Trimester-specific reference ranges'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When evaluating thyroid tests during pregnancy, we typically measure TSH and free T4 (if there is a trimester-specific reference range), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T4. In such settings where free T4 measurements appear discordant with TSH measurements, total T4 should also be measured. (See <a href=\"#H4228306818\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of thyroid function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism from any cause can complicate pregnancy, but Graves' hyperthyroidism is the most common cause of overt hyperthyroidism. hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism is a common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism. It may occur transiently in the first half of gestation and is typically less severe than Graves' disease. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hyperthyroidism complicating pregnancy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes#H12186870\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes&quot;, section on 'Establishing the cause'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy should be based primarily upon a suppressed (&lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> or undetectable (&lt;0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> serum TSH value and also a serum free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> free T3 (or total T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T3) measurement that exceeds the normal range during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for pregnant women with hyperthyroidism are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When iodine nutrition is adequate (as in the United States), the most common cause of hypothyroidism during pregnancy is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis. In iodine-deficient areas, iodine deficiency itself is associated with hypothyroidism and goiter. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hypothyroidism during pregnancy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of overt primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy is based upon the finding of a decreased free T4 concentration (below assay normal using reference range for pregnant women) and an elevated population and trimester-specific serum TSH. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated population and trimester-specific serum TSH concentration with a normal free T4 concentration. (See <a href=\"#H1156783\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H4181675356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of newly diagnosed and preexisting hypothyroidism is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H57693659\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased rate of fetal loss and premature delivery has been reported in euthyroid women with high serum antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody concentrations. Although data are conflicting, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> (T4) treatment of TPO antibody-positive pregnant patients may lower these risks. We suggest thyroid hormone treatment (T4, 50 mcg daily) in euthyroid, TPO-positive women who have had recurrent miscarriage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We do not routinely suggest T4 treatment for TPO-positive, euthyroid women without a prior history of miscarriage whose TSH is in the normal population-based and trimester-specific range. However, since carefully monitored thyroid hormone treatment is safe, some UpToDate editors and the author of this topic review will offer T4 treatment (50 mcg daily) to those patients who prefer this intervention, especially if their TSH is &gt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. However, other experts, including other UpToDate editors, do not routinely treat euthyroid, TPO-positive women with T4, because of insufficient evidence of benefit. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in euthyroid women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Euthyroid women with high serum TPO antibody concentrations are at risk for developing hypothyroidism. In antibody-positive, euthyroid pregnant women who are not treated with thyroid hormone, TSH should be measured every four weeks during the first trimester and, if stable, once during the second and third trimesters to monitor for the development of hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H1504082559\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H57693666\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goiter during pregnancy is rare in the United States. However, goiter during pregnancy is common in regions where iodine intake is low, occurring in 16 to 70 percent of women in iodine-deficient regions of Western Europe. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Goiter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pregnant woman found to have a thyroid nodule should be evaluated in the same way as if she were not pregnant, except that thyroid radionuclide scanning is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H590601\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid nodules'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the typically indolent nature of differentiated thyroid cancer, most women with newly diagnosed differentiated thyroid cancer can delay thyroidectomy until the postpartum period to minimize maternal and fetal complications. Surgery during pregnancy is sometimes indicated for rare patients with larger, more aggressive or rapidly growing cancers or in the presence of extensive nodal or distant metastasis. The safest time for any type of surgery during pregnancy is the second trimester. (See <a href=\"#H57692121\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosed during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When surgery for thyroid cancer is deferred, the patient should be monitored during pregnancy with thyroid ultrasound performed during each trimester. In such cases where thyroid surgery is deferred, we suggest thyroid hormone suppressive therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The goal is to maintain the TSH in the range of 0.3 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H57692121\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosed during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum thyroiditis occurs in 5 to 10 percent of women in the United States. It may occur after pregnancy loss (miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy), as well as after normal delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Glinoer D.
