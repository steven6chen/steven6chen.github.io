Patients in the first group are considered to have pulmonary <strong>arterial </strong>hypertension (group 1 PAH), while patients in the remaining four groups are considered to have PH (group 2, 3, 4, and 5 PH). When all five groups are discussed collectively, the term PH is used. HIV-related PAH (HIV-PAH) belongs to group 1.</p><p>In this topic review, the prevalence, pathogenesis, clinical diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of HIV-PAH are discussed. PH that is unrelated to HIV infection is discussed separately.

This is 100 to 1000-times greater than the prevalence of PAH in individuals without HIV infection.

This study, which was performed from 2004 to 2005 (after the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy [ART]), reported a similar prevalence to that which was reported in studies performed prior to the use of effective ART, suggesting that ART has not altered the prevalence of HIV-PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-associated-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>].

Although treatment is very similar to that in uninfected individuals with PAH, there are subtle difference for patients with HIV-PAH, which is the focus of this section.

More detailed discussions of when to initiate therapy and how to choose a regimen are found elsewhere.

In addition, there were fewer deaths attributable to PAH among patients who received combination ART compared with no therapy (5 versus 38 percent). These results should be interpreted with caution because the pressures were not measured directly by right heart catheterization; in addition the patients who received combination ART were managed during a different therapeutic era for PAH and were, therefore, more likely to receive prostanoid therapy as opposed to other PAH therapies that are now available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study reported that ART improved exercise capacity without significant changes in pulmonary hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-associated-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

However, although anecdotal cases of CCB responses exist, their administration is extremely rare and the approach should be cautious. This approach is based upon the observation that vasoreactivity only occurs in a small proportion of HIV-PAH patients (approximately 1.6 percent) and long term response to CCBs has been reported in only a small number of those patients. In addition, intolerable side effects including hypotension and interaction with antiretroviral therapy, especially protease inhibitors, can develop in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-associated-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus/abstract/10,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,42,43</a>].
