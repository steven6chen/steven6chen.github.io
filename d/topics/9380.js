It happens when one part of the intestine slides into another part of the intestine. Intussusception can happen with either the small or large intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F112306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112306 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>When one part of the intestine slides into another, it causes a blockage. When the intestine is blocked, air, fluid, and food get stuck. They can't move through the intestine the way they normally would. This causes symptoms.</p><p>Intussusception happens most often in babies and children, especially those younger than 3 years old. In some cases, intussusception is caused by another medical condition. But in most cases, doctors don't know what caused the intussusception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7191787\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an intussusception?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms usually start suddenly and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe belly pain &ndash; The pain comes in waves. At first, episodes of pain happen about every 15 to 20 minutes, but the episodes get closer over time. The pain usually makes children cry and pull their knees up into their belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being very sleepy and hard to wake up</p><p/><p>Although uncommon, some children with a small intussusception do not have any symptoms. Their doctor might see that they have an intussusception when the child has a test for another reason. Children who have no symptoms might not need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7191802\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call your child's doctor or nurse right away if your child has symptoms of an intussusception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7191817\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for an intussusception?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your child's symptoms and do an exam. He or she will do an imaging test of the belly, such as an X-ray or ultrasound. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7191832\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an intussusception treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor will do a few things to treat your child's intussusception.</p><p>He or she will give your child fluids into his or her vein through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>He or she will also put a thin tube called a &quot;nasogastric tube&quot; in your child's nose, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The tube will suck up the fluid and air in the stomach. This will make your child feel better and keep him or her from vomiting.</p><p>After that, the doctor will fix the intussusception. There are different ways to do this. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;nonoperative reduction&quot; &ndash; This is also sometimes called an &quot;air enema&quot; or &quot;contrast enema.&quot; It is not surgery. For this procedure, the doctor will put a tube into your child's rectum and push air or a special fluid into the tube. The air or fluid will go into the rectum and through the intestine. As the air or fluid reaches the intussusception, it makes the stuck intestine slide back out of the other part of the intestine. To follow what he or she is doing, the doctor will do an ultrasound or X-ray during this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; If the intussusception could not be fixed with the nonoperative reduction, or if the intussusception has caused problems, your child will probably need surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7191847\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-bowel-obstruction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Small bowel obstruction (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
