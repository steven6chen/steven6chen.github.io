These medicines are given to make sure you do not feel pain during the procedure. In some cases, like when you are &quot;put to sleep&quot; for surgery, the anesthesia also prevents you from remembering it afterwards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85389690\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different types of anesthesia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 3 main types of anesthesia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local &ndash; This type of anesthesia uses medicine to numb a small part of your body so you don't feel pain. It can be given as a cream, gel, or spray on the skin. It can also be given by an injection (shot) into the skin. You might be awake when you get local anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Doctors give local anesthesia before minor surgery, such as a skin or breast biopsy. A biopsy is when a doctor takes a tiny sample of tissue using a needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional &ndash; This type of anesthesia blocks pain in one area of your body, such as an arm, leg, or the lower half of your body. One type is called a &quot;spinal block.&quot; The doctor puts a small needle in your lower back, and injects medicine to numb the nerves in your spine. It can be used for surgery done on your legs or inside your belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another type is an &quot;epidural.&quot; The doctor uses a needle to put a small tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) into your lower back, near the nerves in your spine. Some women get epidurals during childbirth. Other people get them for a surgical procedure or to control pain after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you get regional anesthesia, you might be awake. Or you might get medicines to make you relax and feel sleepy, called &quot;sedatives.&quot; Sedatives are given through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General &ndash; This type of anesthesia makes you unconscious so you can't feel, see, or hear anything during surgery. Some of the medicines are given through an IV. Others are gases that you breathe. You might also get a breathing tube after you are asleep. This tube goes in your mouth or down your throat to help with breathing. A specialist doctor called an &quot;anesthesiologist&quot; gives general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85389707\"><span class=\"h1\">What does an anesthesiologist do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An anesthesiologist will meet with you before your surgery and ask you many questions, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have any health problems?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have any dental problems, such as loose teeth or false teeth?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What medicines do you take, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illegal drugs?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have any allergies to foods or medicines?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you or any of your relatives ever had a problem with anesthesia medicines?</p><p/><p>The type of anesthesia you get depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your answers to the questions above</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of surgery or procedure you are having</p><p/><p>In some cases, your surgeon might want to use a certain type of anesthesia. And in some cases, you might have a choice between different types of anesthesia.</p><p>Your anesthesiologist will also tell you how your anesthesia will be given and answer any questions you have. He or she will carefully check your responses to surgery, and your breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate during the entire procedure to make sure that you are pain free. If you have general anesthesia, your anesthesiologist also makes sure you stay unconscious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85389724\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I wake up during general anesthesia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is very rare to wake up during general anesthesia (less than 1 patient in every 15,000 operations). Your anesthesiologist constantly adjusts the medicines to keep you from waking up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85389741\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there any side effects from anesthesia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each type of anesthesia has side effects.</p><p>If you have a spinal block or epidural, the numbness will last for a few hours after your procedure before wearing off. Other side effects can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble urinating &ndash; Your doctor might use a catheter to empty your bladder until you are able to urinate normally again. This problem usually goes away within a few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache &ndash; There is a small chance of getting a special kind of headache that can last for several days. This is sometimes called a &quot;spinal headache.&quot; It usually goes away on its own, but pain-relieving medicines and other treatments can help.</p><p/><p>If you have general anesthesia, you will likely feel a little groggy or confused for a short time after waking up. Other side effects can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) and throwing up (vomiting) &ndash; Your doctor can give you medicines for this problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sore throat &ndash; This can happen if you had a breathing tube. It usually gets better soon.</p><p/><p>People who have certain medical conditions or certain types of surgery can have trouble breathing after surgery and general anesthesia. People who have this problem sometimes need to keep the breathing tube and stay connected to the machine that helps with breathing for a while after surgery. They stay sedated for the entire time that the breathing tube is in place. Before surgery, your anesthesiologist will explain whether you are likely to have breathing problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H797882824\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about anesthesia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before surgery, you should feel comfortable asking your anesthesiologist any questions about the risks and benefits of anesthesia, and the type of anesthesia that is best for you. After surgery, your anesthesiologist will check on you as you recover. Patient safety during surgery has greatly improved over the years, and this is your anesthesiologist's primary concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85389758\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-after-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain after surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-during-labor-and-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain during labor and delivery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=questions-to-ask-if-you-are-having-surgery-or-a-procedure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Questions to ask if you are having surgery or a procedure (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
