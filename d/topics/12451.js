Patients with HIV are at risk for both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] secondary to medication nephrotoxicity, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>], and immune complex kidney diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. In addition, the aging cohort of HIV-positive patients is at increased risk for kidney disease related to hepatitis B or C virus co-infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>] and comorbid or treatment-related diabetes and hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31719894\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15534502\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology of AKI in HIV-positive patients</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15534676\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence of AKI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is increased in HIV-positive patients compared with patients without HIV. Although the overall incidence of AKI in HIV-positive patients appears to be decreasing in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, the incidence of severe, dialysis-requiring AKI continues to rise.</p><p>In a study of hospitalized adults in New York state that compared administrative data from 1995 (before the introduction of ART) to data from 2003 (after the introduction of ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], AKI was documented in a significantly greater proportion of HIV-positive patients compared with HIV-negative patients, both in 1995 (2.9 versus 1 percent) and 2003 (6 versus 2.7 percent). Because this study relied on administrative data to identify AKI cases, it is likely that only more severe cases were included.</p><p>Other studies have also demonstrated an increasing incidence of severe, dialysis-requiring AKI among hospitalized patients with HIV. In a study including more than 56,000 United States military veterans, the incidence of dialysis-requiring AKI declined early in the ART era but then doubled between 2000 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A similar increase in the incidence of dialysis-requiring AKI among HIV-positive adults was also demonstrated in a nationally representative sample of United States hospital admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Two single-center cohort studies have evaluated the incidence and etiology of AKI among ambulatory patients engaged in HIV care in the ART era, using clinical and laboratory data to identify AKI cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a prospective study of 754 ambulatory HIV-positive patients followed at a single center in the United States, at least one episode of AKI occurred in 71 patients (9.4 percent) during a two-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a retrospective study of more than 2200 HIV patients engaged in care at a single center in London, AKI occurred in 5.7 percent of patients and was most common within the first three months of initiating HIV care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15534695\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for AKI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some risk factors for AKI among HIV-positive patients are similar to risk factors for AKI in the general population, such as older age, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute or chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. However, some risk factors are specific to HIV. In studies that have included detailed data on HIV disease severity, other predictors of AKI included a diagnosis of AIDS, low CD4 count, high viral load, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15534728\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes after AKI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in the general population, the development of AKI increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients. The following examples illustrate an association with both short-term and long-term outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient mortality was significantly more frequent among HIV-positive patients who had AKI than among HIV-positive patients without AKI in a 2003 sample of hospitalized patients in New York state (27 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Dialysis-requiring AKI was also associated with a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality among HIV-positive adults in a nationally representative sample of United States hospital admissions from 2010 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.64, 95% CI 2.04-3.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term mortality is also higher among HIV-positive individuals who develop AKI. In a national sample of United States military veterans from 1986 through 2006, 17,325 HIV-positive patients were hospitalized and survived for at least 90 days after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. AKI occurred in 3060 (18 percent); 334 of these patients with AKI also required dialysis. During an average follow-up of 5.7 years after hospital discharge, the HIV-positive patients who experienced AKI were significantly more likely to die (56 versus 47 percent). End-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular events were also significantly more common among HIV-positive patients with AKI. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15534510\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of AKI in HIV-positive patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the introduction of combination ART, AKI was commonly attributed to septicemia, volume depletion, or medication toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Although data on the etiology of AKI in the ART era are limited, available data suggest that sepsis remains a common contributor and that AKI is often multifactorial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The most common types of AKI in patients with HIV infection, similar to patients without HIV, are prerenal states and acute tubular necrosis. Causes of AKI that are unique to HIV-positive patients are discussed in this section. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31719901\"><span class=\"h3\">Medication nephrotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HIV infection are at risk for nephrotoxicity from ART, as well as from medications used to treat opportunistic infections or hepatitis virus co-infection. In addition, ART-treated patients are often taking additional medications for the treatment of comorbid conditions. Medication nephrotoxicity may present with acute or chronic kidney injury or with acid-base and electrolyte disturbances.

Although kidney biopsy may not be necessary to diagnose TDF toxicity in the setting of proximal tubular dysfunction, it can be useful in cases where the diagnosis is less clear or where there are compelling reasons not to discontinue TDF. As an example, in a French study of 222 patients with HIV infection who underwent kidney biopsy, 29 had tubulopathy (13 percent); TDF was considered a primary or secondary contributing factor in nearly two-thirds of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A newer prodrug, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF), was approved in 2015 based upon studies demonstrating the potential for an improved safety profile.
