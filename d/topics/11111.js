Historical terms that have been used to refer to this tumor include sclerosing sweat duct carcinoma, malignant syringoma, and syringoid carcinoma. Tissue invasion by MAC frequently extends far beyond the clinical margins of the tumor. In addition, perineural involvement is common.</p><p>Although metastasis and death from MAC are rare events, significant morbidity can occur as a result of deep local tissue invasion, and treatment of MAC is recommended. Surgery that results in complete removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice for MAC.</p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of MAC will be discussed in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14228940\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC is a rare tumor that was first described in 1982 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In retrospect, earlier reports documented this tumor prior to its recognition as a distinct entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of reported cases of MAC have been in white individuals; however, MAC can also occur in other populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. An analysis of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database collected between 1973 and 2004 found an incidence rate of 6.5 per 10 million white individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence rates for black subjects and <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders were significantly lower, at 1.9 and 1.6 per 10 million individuals, respectively.</p><p>The sex distribution in studies of patients with MAC has varied from fairly equivalent proportions to a slight female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/7,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-12</a>]. In the SEER database analysis, which represents the largest reported series of patients with MAC (n = 223), 57 percent of patients were female, and 43 percent were male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>MAC most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. The median age for the development of MAC in the SEER database analysis was 68 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rarely, the tumor occurs in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Congenital MAC has been described in a few neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1692579\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rarity of MAC makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions on risk factors for the disease. Ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, and immunosuppression have been proposed as potential contributory factors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultraviolet radiation</strong> &ndash; The common localization of tumors to the head and neck and the elevated frequency in white individuals suggest that exposure to ultraviolet radiation may contribute to the development of MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Also in support of a role for ultraviolet radiation, a series of 48 patients with MAC in the United States (where drivers sit in the left side of the vehicle) found a predominance of left-sided lesions (52 percent on left, 25 percent on right, and 23 percent in midline or unspecified) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], whereas a series of 14 patients in Australia (where drivers sit in the right side of the vehicle) found that more lesions occurred on the right side (56 versus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, ultraviolet light-induced p53 mutations, which have been associated with the development of other cutaneous carcinomas, lack a strong association with MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ionizing radiation</strong> &ndash; The development of tumors in sites of previous radiation therapy has been reported in multiple patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/7,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19-24</a>]. These case reports raise the question of whether ionizing radiation increases risk for MAC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunosuppression</strong> &ndash; Although immunosuppression increases risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, the effect of immunosuppression on the risk for development of MAC is unclear (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-skin-cancer-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for skin cancer in solid organ transplant recipients&quot;</a>). Aggressive tumor behavior has been reported in a few immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; MAC has appeared to arise within a nevus sebaceous in at least three patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>] and in association with multiple benign syringomas in at least two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevus-sebaceus-and-nevus-sebaceus-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nevus sebaceus and nevus sebaceus syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3514792\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic studies strongly suggest that MAC derives from pluripotent cells that exhibit differentiation towards both eccrine structures and hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/2,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31-35</a>]. Immunohistochemical stains that demonstrate hard keratins in the superficial cystic component of MAC support the presence of follicular differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/31,32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,36</a>], and the often positive stains for carcinoembryonic antigen in MAC tumors indicate the presence of eccrine differentiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85945 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/28,32,34,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32,34,37</a>]. Of note, sebaceous differentiation has also been detected in at least two cases of MAC, a finding that lends additional support to the status of pluripotent cells as the cells of tumor origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Few data are available on the cytogenetic analysis of MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. One study found a clonal chromosome 6q deletion similar to that seen in salivary tumors, suggesting a histogenetic relationship between these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3514918\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC most frequently manifests as a fairly unremarkable, white or yellowish papule or plaque with or without overlying telangiectasias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86192%7EDERM%2F86193%7EDERM%2F86194%7EDERM%2F86195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86192 graphicRef86193 graphicRef86194 graphicRef86195 \">picture 1A-D</a>). Individuals with dark skin may present with only an ill-defined papule or nodule that lacks surface or pigmentary changes. The tumor margins are often indistinct, a feature consistent with the common discrepancy between the clinical size of the tumor and the more extensive tumor invasion regularly detected on histological examination. MAC usually presents as a solitary tumor. However, multiple primary tumors have occurred in at least one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Tumor development is usually characterized by slow, gradual growth; periods of stability and more rapid growth may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Early tumors are often only slightly elevated; a more nodular quality tends to develop over time. Tumors that seem fixed to underlying tissues may have invaded underlying structures such as muscle, cartilage, and bone. Ulceration and necrosis are rare findings.</p><p>The vast majority of tumors occur on the head and neck, many of which can be found on the central face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In an analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on 223 patients with MAC, tumors were located on the head and neck in 74 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, tumors may develop in any cutaneous site. Examples of additional reported sites of MAC include the trunk and extremities, breast, vulva, auditory canal, axilla, perineum, hands, feet, and scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/4,5,7,9,36,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,9,36,42-44</a>]. Rarely, MAC develops in extracutaneous locations. MAC involving the tongue, oral cavity, or maxillary sinus has been documented in a few patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/10,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,45</a>].</p><p>Most patients with MAC do not experience associated symptoms. Occasionally, symptoms related to perineural invasion, such as burning, pain, hyperesthesia, or paraesthesias, are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3515538\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of skin biopsy findings is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of MAC. The use of dermoscopy may also provide clues to diagnosis, particularly the absence of scar-like, white, structureless areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Despite the relative ease of skin biopsy procedures, the undramatic clinical appearance and insidious growth of MAC can lead to a delay in biopsy and diagnosis for several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/19,28,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1692653\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superficial shave biopsies are not recommended for the diagnosis of MAC, since the recognition of the architecture of this deeply infiltrative tumor and the detection of perineural invasion are useful for diagnosis. The depth of the biopsy should extend into the deep dermis and subcutis. Thus, punch biopsies, incisional or excisional biopsies, or deep (saucerization) shave biopsies are preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Biopsy techniques'</a>.)</p><p>The use of fine-needle aspiration for the diagnosis of MAC has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, in such cases, a subsequent, larger tissue specimen is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14228954\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathology findings of MAC consist of a deeply infiltrative tumor composed of small nests and cords of bland-appearing cells. The common histologic features of MAC are listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small, keratin-filled cysts in the upper dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85586\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85586 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nests and cords of epithelial cells within a hyalinized stroma that seem to form ductal structures; these structures decrease in size at greater depths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85587%7EDERM%2F85588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85587 graphicRef85588 \">picture 3A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Little, if any, cytologic atypia and few mitoses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perineural invasion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85585\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85585 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep infiltration within the dermis (infiltration into the subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or deeper structures may also be present) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85589\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85589 \">picture 5</a>)</p><p/><p>When MAC encounters bone or cartilage, the tumor may grow laterally along the periosteal or perichondrial plane or may directly invade these structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Although not typically seen, amyloid deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and an inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/31,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,50</a>] have been detected in specimens of MAC. Findings of necrosis and ulceration are uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H857060\"><span class=\"h3\">Histological differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other cutaneous tumors share pathological features with MAC. Careful assessment of the histological features is essential for obtaining the correct diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85946 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/11,31,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31,51</a>].</p><p>The histological differential diagnosis for MAC primarily consists of benign or malignant cutaneous tumors. The recognition of ductal features in MAC distinguishes it from desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and trichoadenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], which are adnexal tumors of follicular origin. The asymmetrical architecture, single-cell strands, and the perineural and deep invasion of MAC differentiate MAC from syringoma, a benign eccrine tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Other disorders to consider in the histological differential diagnosis include morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma, and metastatic breast carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14228968\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests beyond routine hematoxylin and eosin staining of pathology specimens are not typically needed for the diagnosis of MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, immunohistochemical studies are occasionally utilized to support the diagnosis and rule out other disorders when the diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/18,32,53-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,32,53-58</a>]. In particular, the carcinoembryonic antigen stain, which is positive in half of specimens from MAC, is useful for distinguishing MAC from basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85590 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The addition of androgen receptor stain will help distinguish MAC from infiltrating basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The immunohistochemical characteristics of MAC and several disorders that may be mistaken for MAC are provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85945 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3515548\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indurated papules, plaques, or nodules of MAC may clinically resemble scars, morpheaform basal cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56527\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56527 \">picture 7</a>), squamous cell carcinoma, syringomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85851 \">picture 8</a>), and cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85947 \">table 3</a>). Histopathological examination distinguishes MAC from these disorders. (See <a href=\"#H14228954\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H857060\" class=\"local\">'Histological differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14228982\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients diagnosed with MAC should receive a full skin examination that includes careful inspection of the tumor site to assess the clinical extent of the tumor. While nodal spread is rare, palpation of the regional lymph nodes should also be performed to assess for enlarged lymph nodes that may indicate regional metastasis. If enlarged lymph nodes are detected, lymph node biopsy via fine-needle aspiration or surgical removal of the enlarged lymph node is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Radiologic studies are not necessary in most patients diagnosed with MAC. However, if the physical examination suggests that the tumor may be fixed to underlying structures or there is a large tumor (eg, &ge;2 cm) in the periorbital area, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for evaluating for invasion of bone, other deep structures, or the orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/49,61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,61-64</a>]. Radiologic imaging of other body sites is not indicated in the absence of signs or symptoms suggestive of distant disease.</p><p>The staging of MAC correlates with the staging system for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma outlined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110946 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14228989\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is the primary treatment modality utilized for the management of MAC.

The surgical techniques most commonly utilized for MAC include Mohs micrographic surgery, a procedure that involves histological assessment of the complete tissue margin, and conventional surgical excision with postoperative margin assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest Mohs surgery, rather than conventional surgical excision with postoperative margin assessment, for the treatment of MAC. This is because the infiltrative quality and often extensive subclinical extension of this tumor can make complete removal by other surgical procedures challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>No high-quality trials have evaluated Mohs surgery or conventional surgical excision for the treatment of MAC, and the relative efficacy of these procedures for improving patient outcomes remains uncertain. A systematic review of small case series and single case reports suggests that tumors treated with Mohs surgery are less likely to have positive margin and recur compared with those treated with wide local excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, Mohs surgery may result in defect sizes that may be up to six times larger than the size of the clinically apparent tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>When Mohs surgery is not an option (eg, tumor size or patient comorbidities prohibit treatment in an outpatient setting, or the procedure is unavailable), conventional surgical excision with postoperative pathological margin assessment can be utilized for treatment. Intraoperative frozen sections are useful for guiding the extent of excision in these cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1196579\"><span class=\"h3\">Mohs surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mohs surgery is an outpatient procedure that allows for intraoperative assessment of 100 percent of the excised tumor margin. This enables the surgeon to confirm complete removal of the tumor on the day of surgery prior to wound closure and allows for the sparing of the maximum amount of healthy tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery#H9314583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;, section on 'Surgical technique'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery#H9483394\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;, section on 'Advantages'</a>.)</p><p>In comparison to conventional surgical excision, Mohs surgery may reduce the need for subsequent surgical procedures. A retrospective study of 48 patients with MAC found that 7 of 23 patients (30 percent) treated with conventional surgical excision did not achieve clear margins after the procedure and had to return for additional surgery. In contrast, clear margins were achieved within a single treatment session in all 22 patients who were treated with Mohs surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>MAC has recurred after Mohs surgery, a finding that reflects the difficulty in achieving complete removal of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A prospective study found that MAC recurred in 1 of 20 patients who were followed for at least five years after Mohs surgery for primary or recurrent tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Retrospective studies with more than 10 patients have found recurrence rates after Mohs surgery between 0 and 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/11,12,25,51,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,25,51,67</a>].</p><p>Disadvantages of Mohs surgery include its status as a potentially lengthy procedure and as a specialized surgical technique that is not available in all clinical settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery#H9483386\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;, section on 'Advantages and disadvantages'</a>.)</p><p>Several authors have suggested alterations to the standard Mohs surgery procedure in attempts to improve surgical outcomes. One example is the use of a toluidine blue stain, which may facilitate the identification of isolated tumor nests and perineural invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In addition, because the histological detection of small islands or strands of tumor cells may be easier in permanent sections than in the frozen sections typically utilized in Mohs surgery, techniques utilizing permanent sections have been proposed as methods that may reduce the risk for treatment failure. These include the obtainment of an additional layer of tissue for permanent sections after apparent tumor clearance via Mohs surgery and the performance of a staged Mohs surgery-like procedure utilizing permanent rather than frozen sections (&quot;slow Mohs&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/46,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,69,70</a>]. The effects of these procedures on patient outcomes have not been evaluated in formal studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1196586\"><span class=\"h3\">Conventional surgical excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional surgical excision has been successfully used for the treatment of MAC. Conventional surgical excision is more widely available than Mohs surgery.</p><p>A major challenge with conventional surgical excision is the often extensive subclinical extension of MAC, a feature that makes it difficult to identify the surgical margin that is likely to result in complete removal of the tumor. Surgical margins are determined on an individual basis, with reported margins ranging from a few millimeters to 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Re-excision is performed if postoperative histologic examination reveals that a tumor is not completely removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Although the impact of the addition of intraoperative frozen sections to traditional surgical excision in MAC has not been specifically studied, our experience suggests that this intervention may help surgeons to more closely approximate the amount of tissue removal necessary for tumor removal during surgery. Frozen sections may be particularly useful in sites on the head and neck where tissue sparing is a significant concern. We suggest the use of intraoperative frozen sections to guide the extent of excision when feasible.</p><p>Another challenge of conventional surgical excision is the fact that less than 1 percent of the tissue margin is typically evaluated during histological examination of the excised tissue. Due to the infiltrative and often asymmetric architecture of MAC, this could lead to a failure to detect residual tumor. Data are limited on the frequency with which tumor recurrence develops following conventional surgical excision. The likelihood of recurrence was high in a retrospective study in which 15 patients were followed for 3 to 25 years; tumors recurred in seven patients (47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14229010\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role radiation therapy should play in the treatment of MAC is uncertain. Case reports suggest that radiation therapy alone is capable of achieving clinical clearance of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]; however, tumors may recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/72,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,74</a>] or fail to respond to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Of note, the recurrence of MAC in a histologically more aggressive form after radiation therapy has been reported in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. This finding has not been documented elsewhere.</p><p>The use of radiation therapy as an adjuvant to surgical intervention was evaluated in a retrospective study of 14 patients with MAC (11 of whom had positive surgical margins) who were followed for a median of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the study, 13 of 14 patients achieved local control, prompting the authors to suggest that conventional surgical excision plus radiation therapy could yield success rates similar to those observed with Mohs surgery.</p><p>Data are insufficient to support a routine recommendation for the use of radiation therapy in patients with MAC. Complete surgical excision remains our treatment of choice for MAC; we reserve radiation therapy for the infrequent cases in which complete surgical removal is not possible and for adjuvant treatment following the complete excision of recurrent tumors in critical locations, such as the periorbital area. Additional studies are necessary to determine the efficacy, safety, indications, and optimal treatment regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1197613\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Locoregional or distant metastasis of MAC is a rare event, and standards for the approach to such patients are lacking. Data on the management of metastatic disease are limited to case reports. A patient with a 4 cm tumor in the axilla, for whom excision of the tumor and axillary lymph nodes revealed two positive lymph nodes, exhibited no signs of tumor recurrence for 31 months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A separate patient with MAC on the scalp and biopsy-confirmed cervical lymph node involvement who was treated with a modified radical neck dissection and radiation therapy had no signs of recurrence at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Other case reports document failures to respond to treatments directed at metastatic disease. An immunocompromised patient with intransit metastases failed to achieve a lasting response with radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, a single course of cisplatinum and 5-fluororuracil resulted in no improvement or minimal improvement in two patients with MAC and distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/61,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14229024\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC is primarily a locally aggressive tumor. Metastasis to the lymph nodes or other sites is uncommon. As of 2011, fewer than 10 cases of regional lymph node or distant metastasis had been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The rarity of metastasis is supported by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data; among 223 patients with MAC, regional lymph node involvement was present in three patients (1 percent), and distant metastases occurred in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Deep local invasion occurred more frequently; extension into the subcutaneous tissue was noted in 7 percent of patients, and invasion of the underlying soft tissue, muscle, or bone was documented in 9 percent of patients.</p><p>Tumor recurrence resulting from incomplete removal of the tumor is the major prognostic concern in MAC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86196\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86196 \">picture 9</a>). The time course to tumor recurrence varies widely. Most cases recur within two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, recurrence up to 29 years after has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Risk factors for tumor recurrence have not been definitively established. Some authors propose that tumors that demonstrate perineural invasion may be more likely to recur after Mohs surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. This may be due to tumor &quot;skip&quot; areas along involved nerves that lead to failures to detect residual perineural tumor.</p><p>There are multiple reports of MAC extending into the orbit, leading to tumor invasion into the brain through the optic nerve or the nerves superior to the orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/49,63,70,74,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,63,70,74,76</a>].<sup> </sup>This suggests that this location is associated with increased risk for morbidity and that treatment should be followed with close long-term monitoring.</p><p>A few cases of death related to local tumor extension into vital areas (eg, intracranial invasion) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/62,70,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,70,77</a>]. Only one death directly attributable to metastatic MAC has been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14229031\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines for the follow-up of patients with MAC have not been established. The potential for delayed recurrence after years indicates that long-term follow-up is necessary. We typically follow patients every 6 to 12 months and perform a full skin examination and lymph node palpation at each visit. Patients with histories of tumors that invade into deep, vital, or conduit structures (such as the orbit) likely need to be followed more closely. The optimal frequency of follow-up of these patients depends on the individual clinical scenario.</p><p>We usually perform radiologic imaging only if signs or symptoms suggestive of extracutaneous involvement are present. Occasionally radiologic studies (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used to follow patients with deeply invasive tumors in which physical examination is not adequate for assessing signs of tumor recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14229038\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare, infiltrative cutaneous tumor that is often found on the head and neck.
