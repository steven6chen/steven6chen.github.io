The syndrome is caused by absence of expression of the paternally active genes on the long arm of chromosome 15. The vast majority of cases occur sporadically.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and approaches to treatment of PWS will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and genetics of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected pregnancies often exhibit reduced fetal activity, polyhydramnios, and breech positioning. Third-trimester ultrasounds may show unusual positioning of the fetal hands and feet, with flexed wrists and dorsi-extended feet with flexed toes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These abnormalities of limb positioning are supported only by case reports, but are probably more specific than other ultrasound findings for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Cytogenetic examination is revealing only if specific molecular diagnosis for PWS is requested. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal hypotonia is one of the hallmark features of this disorder and is a valuable clue to initiate diagnostic testing. The profound hypotonia can lead to asphyxia. Affected infants often have feeding difficulties, including a poor suck, which may lead to failure to thrive. Other common features include a weak cry and genital hypoplasia (eg, cryptorchidism, scrotal hypoplasia, or clitoral hypoplasia). Depigmentation of the skin or eyes relative to the familial background is present in 30 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Early childhood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toddlers with PWS demonstrate late acquisition of major motor milestones. Children between one and six years of age commonly manifest symptoms of hyperphagia with progressive development of obesity if access to food is unrestricted. Body composition is abnormal, with reduced lean body mass and increased fat mass as compared with normal and obese controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Perhaps as a result of the reduced lean body mass, resting energy expenditure is also reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Short stature is usually present during childhood and most patients fail to have a pubertal growth spurt. Most patients with PWS have growth hormone deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Late childhood and adolescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pubic and axillary hair may arise prematurely in children with PWS due to adrenarche, but other secondary sexual characteristics generally are delayed or incomplete. Testicular descent has occurred as late as adolescence. Menarche is often delayed, perhaps in part because of concurrent obesity: menarche may occur as late as age 30 years in response to significant weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other complications of obesity (eg, sleep apnea, cor pulmonale, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis), hypogonadism (osteoporosis), and behavioral issues are common problems in adolescents and adults with PWS. Up to 25 percent of patients with PWS have epilepsy, which is usually focal (eg, staring spells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Scoliosis is frequently seen among patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, with reported prevalence of 37 percent; 13 percent of patients require brace treatment or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and management of comorbidities'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76546868\"><span class=\"h2\">Adulthood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, survival after age 50 for individuals with PWS was uncommon; many of the deaths in adults are attributable to obesity and its complications, including cardiovascular problems, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Advances in the care of these patients have improved life expectancy somewhat. One case series describes 12 individuals older than 50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most of these individuals had experienced decline in physical and psychological function with advancing age. A separate case series of 26 individuals older than 40 years of age found evidence of dementia in four (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All four patients with early onset dementia were female, had a long history of psychotic illness, and had maternal uniparental disomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">BEHAVIOR CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral problems and learning difficulties are commonly seen in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Young children manifest temper tantrums, stubbornness, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors that can impede school performance. Some of these behaviors are similar to those found in pervasive developmental disorder (autism). In a systematic review, behaviors meeting criteria for autism spectrum disorder were found in 27 percent of individuals with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One publication has linked autistic type behaviors to mutation of the MAGEL2 gene located within the Prader-Willi syndrome locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other studies suggest that these behaviors are particularly common in PWS caused by uniparental disomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15-17</a>] (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below). Rectal gouging and skin-picking behavior is common, and may respond to treatment with n-acetylcysteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. A variety of psychiatric symptoms and disorders have been reported among adults, including mood disorders and florid psychotic states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/20,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,23</a>]. </p><p>A mild to moderate degree of cognitive impairment is a commonly associated characteristic; in one study the mean IQ of individuals with PWS was 40 points below the population mean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The range of IQs is normally distributed, thus about 5 percent of individuals with PWS will have IQs in the low-normal range (&gt;85), and 5 percent will have severe intellectual disability (mental retardation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Food-seeking behaviors may include eating garbage, eating frozen food, and stealing resources to obtain food. Decreased ability to vomit and increased tolerance of pain can promote binging on spoiled foods and delay treatment for gastrointestinal disease. After episodes of binge eating (eg, at holidays), both thin and obese individuals with PWS have developed abdominal discomfort with acute gastric dilation seen on radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Choking episodes, typically associated with voracious eating habits, have been reported as the cause of death among 8 percent of patients in one series of sudden death cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A variety of gastrointestinal peptides including pancreatic polypeptide, cholecystokinin and ghrelin have been studied among individuals with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The mechanism that causes impaired satiety in individuals with PWS is unknown. However, levels of ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide, are persistently elevated in individuals with PWS as compared with weight-matched controls, providing a possible mechanism for the increased appetite in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Because this does not appear to be the case for young lean patients with PWS, some authors have proposed that a surge in ghrelin might precede the hyperphagia and obesity observed in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. To date, the role of ghrelin as a primary or secondary factor in the satiety defect is unclear. Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is another potential mediator of hyperphagia in PWS; this neurohormone is decreased among individuals with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is suspected in patients who have characteristic clinical features and is confirmed by genetic testing. Clinical diagnostic criteria were developed in 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. For children three years of age or younger, the diagnosis of PWS is highly likely if five points are scored from among these criteria (four from major criteria). In children older than three years of age and adults, eight points are required (five or more from among the major criteria).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major criteria (one point each): neonatal and infantile hypotonia, feeding problems during infancy, excessive weight gain after infancy, characteristic facial features, hypogonadism, global developmental delay or mild to moderate intellectual disability, and hyperphagia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor criteria (one half point each): decreased fetal movement, characteristic behavior problems (usually multiple), sleep disturbance or sleep apnea, short stature, hypopigmentation, small hands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feet, narrow hands with straight ulnar border, eye abnormalities (esotropia, myopia), thick viscous saliva with crusting at corners of mouth, speech articulation defects, and skin picking. </p><p/><p>However, now that definitive testing is available, it is appropriate to use less rigid clinical criteria to determine who should undergo genetic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on a retrospective review of the clinical characteristics of 90 patients with genetically confirmed PWS, molecular testing should be considered in patients who have all of the following clinical features for their age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth to two years<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypotonia with poor suck</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two to six years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypotonia with history of poor suck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Global developmental delay</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>6 to 12 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of hypotonia with poor suck (hypotonia often persists)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Global developmental delay</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excessive eating (hyperphagia: obsession with food), with obesity if food intake is uncontrolled</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>13 years through adulthood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cognitive impairment; usually mild mental retardation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excessive eating (hyperphagia: obsession with food) with central obesity if uncontrolled</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypothalamic hypogonadism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> typical behavior problems (including temper tantrums and obsessive-compulsive features)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by absence of expression of the paternally active genes on the long arm of chromosome 15, either due to deletions from the paternal chromosome, maternal disomy, or (rarely) defects in the imprinting center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61992 \">table 1</a>). Molecular testing for PWS is highly sensitive, as standard panels with a methylation analysis will detect more than 99 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Testing is done in a sequence that allows identification of all potential genetic defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94207\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94207 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. A standard diagnostic panel for PWS begins with karyotype and methylation studies, followed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and then microsatellite probes to detect maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-prader-willi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Further testing and genetic counseling may be necessary in families with a child who has a mutation affecting the imprinting center or a parental chromosome translocation. While these mutations are rare, they are associated with a risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF COMORBIDITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional diagnostic evaluation should be considered in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) because of their increased risk for hypogonadism and weight-related complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients exhibit evidence of hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction manifested as short stature, central obesity, hypogonadism, and osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth hormone deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth hormone secretion is generally blunted in PWS. The preponderance of evidence suggests that this is a primary abnormality of PWS, rather than a consequence of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. This is suggested by the low IGF-I levels in patients with PWS, in contrast to the low GH secretion and normal IGF-I that is typically found in cases of exogenous obesity. If children with PWS have evidence of growth failure, they are likely to have growth hormone deficiency. However, other causes of growth failure should be excluded, including hypothyroidism and under-nutrition (if the child is young and failing to thrive, or on a low-calorie diet). </p><p>Growth hormone has beneficial effects on body composition as well as linear growth. However, growth hormone therapy must be managed with caution, because patients with PWS and severe obesity or respiratory impairment may be at increased risk for life-threatening adverse effects of growth hormone treatment. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypogonadism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypogonadism in PWS is characterized by low LH and inhibin B and high FSH, features suggesting both hypothalamic and peripheral abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The vast majority of patients with PWS are sterile, but pregnancy has been reported in at least two women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. About two-thirds of boys display cryptorchidism. A trial of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is suggested prior to surgical treatment of cryptorchidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In one series of boys with PWS treated with hCG for six weeks, almost one-quarter of testes reached a stable scrotal position and thus did not require orchiopexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Treatment for hypogonadism may include administration of hCG or sex steroids, but protocols specific to PWS patients have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/37,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,42</a>]. Until systematic studies of sex hormone replacement are reported, we suggest that sex hormone therapy be offered, in consultation with an endocrinologist if possible, if there are symptoms of hypogonadism, including lack of secondary sexual development or decreased bone density. An expert panel has suggested annual monitoring of sex steroids and bone mineral density in adolescents and adults, with hormone replacement as indicated. Because of concerns about hormonal effects on mood and behavior, replacement doses should be minimized and titrated to the individual's response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are useful in monitoring bone density, as well as body composition.

Other causes of osteopenia should be excluded, including inadequate intake of vitamin D and calcium, and hypothyroidism.</p><p>DXA scans should be obtained on all patients with PWS beginning at five years of age, and every two to three years thereafter. In addition, calcium and vitamin D intake should be monitored through periodic dietary recalls, and supplemented as necessary to meet daily recommended intakes for both of these nutrients.

In a study of 25 patients, 60 percent had an abnormal response to a test of ACTH secretory ability, suggesting that they might be at risk for acute adrenal insufficiency under stress conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Whether the subclinical adrenal dysfunction detected by this laboratory testing is responsible for some of the unexplained deaths observed in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome remains to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Tests of ACTH secretory ability'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Other neuroendocrine functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid hormone concentrations may be normal in PWS, but in our experience up to 15 percent of patients have hypothyroidism. These observations could be confounded by the presence of obesity, which can cause a mild reversible elevation of TSH. Thyroid and adrenal status should be evaluated in patients with PWS when clinically warranted. Screening for hypothyroidism is appropriate in any child with growth failure or decreased bone density, and those in whom there is an inadequate response to growth hormone therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity-related problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PWS who develop obesity are at high risk for all obesity-related medical problems.

Sleep-disordered breathing occurs in at least 70 percent of children and young adults with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], and is associated with increased daytime sleepiness and behavioral disturbances. Clinicians should monitor all patients for sleep-related symptoms, including consistent snoring, pauses in breathing longer than five seconds, or daytime sleepiness, particularly during intercurrent respiratory illnesses. Patients with severe obesity or any clinical symptoms of sleep apnea should be referred for a polysomnogram (sleep study), if possible, and evaluated for adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or tracheostomy placement may be required in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea. Patients with PWS who undergo adenotonsillectomy may be at increased risk for respiratory complications during the perioperative period, so close monitoring is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) often improves after adenotonsillectomy, but may not resolve or may recur, so it is important to follow the patients postoperatively with polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Although a series of PWS patients undergoing bariatric surgery reported complete amelioration of symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing after surgery, these results should be interpreted with caution, because factors other than obesity contribute to OSA in individuals with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. CPAP treatment may also be indicated, but is often not well tolerated by the patient. Patients with substantial obstructive sleep apnea should be evaluated for cor pulmonale.

In patients with obesity, it may be difficult to detect scoliosis with a physical examination, so radiographic evaluation is recommended.</p><p>Because the risk of scoliosis generally increases with height velocity, the risk of scoliosis might be increased in patients treated with growth hormone (as was shown for patients with Turner syndrome treated with growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]). However, studies have suggested that growth hormone therapy does not increase the risk or severity of scoliosis in patients with PWS, and the presence of scoliosis is not a contraindication to growth hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>].</p><p>Several case series have reported unusually high complication rates for scoliosis surgery in individuals with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>].

Several clinical trials have demonstrated beneficial effects of GH treatment on linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/63,72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,72-75</a>]. Body composition, including fat-free mass and bone density abnormalities, also appears to improve with GH treatment.</p><p>Use of GH for children with growth failure and genetically confirmed PWS was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, and has been approved for this use in most countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Most individuals with PWS will have GH deficiency when formally tested. Nonetheless, it is generally not necessary to evaluate children formally for GH deficiency before considering GH treatment for patients with PWS and growth failure. Growth failure is typically defined by the standards used for children without PWS (decreased height velocity or decreased height in comparison to the mid-parental height prediction). Measurements of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) are used by some endocrinologists for anecdotal evidence of GH deficiency and are sometimes used to target GH doses.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that early initiation of GH treatment (eg, before two years of age) improves clinical outcomes, as detailed in the following section. Early initiation of GH could be difficult in the United States, where the PWS indication requires growth failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. For infants and children with PWS who do not meet criteria for growth failure, formal testing for GH deficiency may assist the pediatric endocrinologist and family in making decisions about early initiation of treatment. Interpretation of tests for GH deficiency is limited by the possibility of false-positive (low) results, especially in patients with obesity. Decisions about initiating GH should be made collaboratively with the family. The discussion should include the potential benefits of GH for PWS patients on body composition and bone density, in addition to treating and correcting short stature, as well as the potential risks for this population, as discussed in the following sections. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and dosing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> below.) </p><p>Because of reports of specific risks of GH treatment for children with PWS, warning labels have been added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Nevertheless, patients have had continued improvement in linear growth, bone density, and body composition when GH has been administered in sufficient doses for as long as five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Even with long-term GH treatment, body composition is not completely normalized.</p><p>GH has generally been used in children with PWS older than the age of two years. However, some studies have demonstrated beneficial effects in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. In one report, administration of GH to children with PWS who were younger than two years of age resulted in significantly increased lean body mass and delayed fat tissue accumulation compared with a group that received coenzyme Q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Similar improvements in body composition with GH therapy were reported in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 29 infants and toddlers with PWS (aged 4 to 37 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Initiating treatment before the age of 18 months was associated with accelerated acquisition of mobility skills compared with controls of the same age. Additional long-term observation will be required to determine whether therapy with GH increases adult height. The high cost of treatment with GH and the possibility of side effects also are important issues for parents and clinicians to consider.</p><p>We suggest that GH treatment be offered to all patients with PWS and growth failure, unless contraindicated by the presence of severe obesity (eg, weight &gt;225 percent of ideal body weight), uncontrolled diabetes, respiratory compromise, or severe sleep apnea, or acute respiratory infection (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> below). The optimal approach to dosing GH for PWS has not been fully established, but both of the following approaches are supported by some clinical studies and expert opinion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight-based dosing &ndash; GH may be dosed based on body weight, with recommended doses for infants and children of 0.034 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>], although some experts use 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The patient's actual body weight is used even if the patient is obese. Some providers monitor IGF-I and adjust doses accordingly, although routine monitoring of IGF-I is not thought to be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BSA-based dosing &ndash; Consensus guidelines suggest a starting dose of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> for infants and children based on body surface area (BSA), with subsequent adjustments up to about 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> as needed to achieve a target IGF-I level in the upper part of the normal range for age (+1 to +2 SD for age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

However, there<sup> </sup>are modest benefits in body composition and cognition when GH is given to adults with PWS who were not treated during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99</a>]. Moreover, discontinuation of GH treatment after epiphysial closure leads to adverse changes in body composition. This was demonstrated in a randomized trial in which young adults who continued on GH (at a dose of 0.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day)</span> had higher lean body mass and lower fat mass compared with those who discontinued GH therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].

When GH is used for adults with PWS, the typically recommended starting dose range is the same as that for non-PWS adults with GH deficiency, ie, 0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> with further dose adjustments targeted to achieve a serum IGF-I level between 0 and +2 SD for age and gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The dosing may also be influenced by the presence of edema, prior GH treatment and sensitivity, and concomitant oral estrogen use. The final doses for adults with GH deficiency with or without PWS after titration are typically between 0.2 and 1.6 mg per day.

Particular care should be taken in managing this issue in infants and toddlers, who appear to be at the highest risk for respiratory compromise because of underlying hypotonia.

Oromotor evaluation, swallow study, and thickened high-calorie feedings are commonly used early in life; patients with significant reflux or swallowing dysfunction may require gastrostomy or fundoplication. Of note, fundoplication should be considered with caution given potential adverse effects on swallowing and esophageal clearance, and given these individuals' tendency to over-eat later in life. Caloric goals should be guided by a dietitian and designed to promote moderate rates of weight gain, with appropriate intake of protein and micronutrients. Excessive caloric restriction prior to three years of age (unless deemed medically necessary because of significant obesity) might limit brain myelination and cognitive development, while excessively rapid growth may increase the long-term predisposition to obesity. Growth standards (disease-specific growth curves) have been developed for infants and toddlers with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. The standards were developed using a sample of 186 white infants with PWS who were living in the United States and not treated with growth hormone. </p><p>Other interventions are offered to optimize cognitive and physical development. Intensive physical and occupational therapies can assist with muscle tone and strength.

To achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, caloric goals must often be set well below those predicted for children without PWS. With these low-calorie diets, vitamin and mineral (calcium) supplementation is usually required to meet daily requirements. Consultation with a pediatric dietitian is important to set appropriate goals for body weight and nutrition. Growth charts have been developed for children 3 to 18 years of age with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. The standards were developed using a sample of 133 white children and adolescents with PWS who were not treated with growth hormone. </p><p>Some behavioral modification techniques have been helpful in engaging the cooperation of the patient. However, strict limitation of access to food using physical barriers (locks) and close supervision is generally necessary. Coordination of efforts between the patient's family, school, and a multidisciplinary care team is valuable. Stealing and hoarding food are common behaviors, even when the individual is otherwise well behaved. For some patients, a specialized highly structured group home environment is used to manage PWS-associated obesity.</p><p>In spite of concerted efforts by the families and caregivers, many children and adults with PWS will continue to have severe obesity and associated medical problems. More invasive approaches to treatment of PWS-associated obesity have been attempted, but literature provides minimal evidence on which to evaluate the safety or efficacy of these approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with anorectic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a> and fenfluramine has not been effective in controlling appetite in patients with PWS.

Other classes of psychotropic drugs including neuroleptics may be useful in treatment of behavioral symptoms, but their benefits must be weighed against their potential weight-promoting side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/18,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,115</a>].</p><p>Treatment of patients with somatostatin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a> has also been explored because these agents are predicted to suppress ghrelin and its orexigenic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>]. However, this approach has not been beneficial in patients with PWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical weight loss procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are scattered reports of surgical weight loss procedures in patients with PWS, including gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion, and gastric restrictive procedures. The literature in this area consists of case reports, most with follow-up of less than two years, and results are inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. Some of the reports are more than 20 years old, and describe surgical techniques that are no longer used. However, it appears that there may be fewer benefits and greater risks of weight loss surgery for individuals with PWS as compared with other individuals with obesity.</p><p>In a retrospective review of PWS patients undergoing weight loss surgery, 63 percent of those undergoing gastric bypass had poor weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. There may be some long-term efficacy for the most malabsorptive of these procedures (biliopancreatic diversion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>], but these operations also confer increased risks because of chronic malabsorption of micronutrients and electrolytes. Patients with PWS may be at particularly high risk after operations causing malabsorption because they already have an increased risk for osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>] (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Osteoporosis'</a> above). Furthermore, surgical procedures that restrict the stomach may be particularly risky for patients with PWS, as there are reports of gastric dilation and necrosis after gastric restrictive procedures. A case series describes outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy in 24 children and adolescents with PWS, with promising results in weight loss and comorbidity improvement after three to five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, cautious interpretation of these results is warranted due to limited experience with weight loss surgery in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Hypotonic infants with PWS are also at risk for asphyxia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Common clinical features in older children, adolescents, and adults are voracious appetite, with obesity if food is not restricted, decreased cognition, and hypogonadism. Short stature relative to genetic background usually becomes apparent during childhood or puberty. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing for PWS is highly sensitive (&gt;99 percent sensitivity) using disease-specific test panels, and is the gold standard for making the diagnosis of PWS. Clinical screening is designed to determine which patients should have genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Indications for genetic testing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care of the patient with PWS includes monitoring and management of comorbid conditions. Important comorbidities that can be acutely life-threatening include sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and gastric distension and rupture. Other comorbid conditions associated with obesity are common. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and management of comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unless contraindicated, we suggest treatment with growth hormone (GH) in all children and adolescents with PWS who have clinical evidence of growth failure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). GH therapy improves linear growth and also body composition, including fat-free mass and bone density abnormalities. Contraindications include severe obesity, severe sleep apnea, or respiratory compromise, as there may be an increased risk of death in these patients. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of respiratory obstruction, particularly during the first few months of GH treatment. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of GH treatment has not been established. The most rapid improvements are seen during the first 12 months of therapy, and more modest improvements are seen for up to five years of treatment if sufficient doses of GH are given. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of feeding and obesity is a critical part of care for patients with PWS. We recommend designing a highly structured living environment in which access to food is strictly limited through close supervision and physical barriers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Management of feeding and obesity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No pharmacological agent, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentermine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentermine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a>, or SSRIs, has been shown to be helpful in controlling appetite or binge eating and we suggest NOT using these agents for this purpose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Psychotropic drugs are often used for behavior control. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss surgery for patients with PWS has been reported, but not well-studied. There are concerns about both efficacy and safety of the procedure in these patients. Until better information is available, we suggest NOT performing weight loss surgery for patients with PWS unless it is in the context of a disease-specific research protocol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
