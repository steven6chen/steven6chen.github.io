With existing immunosuppressive protocols, acute rejection rates have fallen to approximately 8 percent at most transplant centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Acute rejection can be broadly categorized into T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection (TCMR) and antibody-mediated (previously known as humoral) rejection (ABMR). A renal allograft biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis and determine the severity of rejection in order to determine the most appropriate approach to therapy. TCMR and ABMR may also coexist at the same time in the renal allograft (ie, mixed acute rejection). The presence of histologic evidence of acute rejection on biopsy without an elevation in the serum creatinine concentration is known as subclinical rejection.</p><p>The treatment of acute TCMR of the renal allograft will be reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of acute rejection and the treatment of acute ABMR are discussed separately.

We administer pulse IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> at 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for three to five doses, with a maximum daily dose of 500 mg. After a glucocorticoid pulse, oral glucocorticoids are tapered immediately to the maintenance dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> the patient had been taking prior to the episode. If there are no concerns for nonadherence, we augment the maintenance prednisone dose. As an example, if the rejection occurred while the patient was taking 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> we would increase the maintenance prednisone to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. In addition, we adjust the other components of the patient's maintenance immunosuppression as needed.

(See <a href=\"#H3446565501\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the response to therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with <strong>Banff grade IB</strong> TCMR and few or no chronic histologic lesions who present less than one year posttransplant, we give rATG-Thymoglobulin in addition to pulse glucocorticoids at 1.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose over one to three days for a total dose of 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. In such patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> is administered as 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum dose of 500 mg) prior to each dose of rATG-Thymoglobulin. We prefer to give a shorter, higher-dose course of treatment (ie, a single dose of rATG-Thymoglobulin 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> to reduce cost and length of hospital stay. Our rationale for adding rATG-Thymoglobulin in these patients is based upon evidence that severe (t3) tubulitis, which distinguishes Banff grade IB from IA TCMR, is associated with worse graft outcomes compared with milder (t1 or t2) grades of tubulitis and, therefore, may warrant more aggressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> is the first-line therapy for acute TCMR in most centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition to the intensification of maintenance immunosuppression therapy, such pulse glucocorticoids are usually the only additional treatment added if the rejection is Banff class IA or IB. The expected reversal rate for the first episode of acute TCMR is 60 to 70 percent with this regimen. With a successful response, the urine output increases and the serum creatinine starts decreasing within five days after initiating therapy.</p><p>Although the majority of patients respond to glucocorticoids, few high-quality studies have compared the efficacy of various glucocorticoid regimens for the treatment of TCMR. In one trial involving 95 episodes of renal allograft rejection occurring in 45 renal transplant recipients, treatment with IV pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (given as 1 g boluses) or high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> resulted in a similar rate of reversal of rejection (approximately 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Fluid retention was more common among patients treated with high-dose oral prednisolone. The study was performed prior to the understanding that TCMR and ABMR are separate diagnoses and, therefore, did not differentiate between these types of rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1857849277\"><span class=\"h2\">Banff grade II or III rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach in patients with Banff grade II or III rejection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection#H346691042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;, section on 'Acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection'</a>) is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with biopsy-proven <strong>Banff grade IIA, IIB, or III</strong> TCMR (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection#H346691042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;, section on 'Acute T cell-mediated (cellular) rejection'</a>), we typically advocate inpatient admission for management. We administer pulse IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for three to five doses (with a maximum daily dose of 500 mg), followed by a short tapered dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. A typical glucocorticoid taper would be to start with prednisone 40 mg daily and to reduce the daily dose by 10 mg every five days until a dose of 10 mg daily is reached, after which the daily dose is reduced to 5 mg daily after another five days. In addition, we administer daily rATG-Thymoglobulin at 1.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose for a total dose of 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. The total number of doses is determined by severity of Banff grading. As an example, in patients with Banff class IIA TCMR, we would give rATG-Thymoglobulin 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for two days, and in patients with Banff class III TCMR, we would give 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for four to five days depending upon the response in serum creatinine.

We also give alemtuzumab, rather than rATG-Thymoglobulin, to patients who have a previous history of significant rabbit exposure (ie, history of having raised or ingested rabbits) and, therefore, may be at risk for developing serum sickness after treatment with rATG-Thymoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>all</strong> patients who are treated with rATG-Thymoglobulin (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>) and high-dose glucocorticoids, we recommence antimicrobial and antiviral prophylaxis for at least three months with a regimen that is identical to that administered in the immediate posttransplant period. This includes prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease, and herpes simplex infection (in patients who are at low-CMV risk). In addition, we also administer antifungal prophylaxis, although this practice may vary by transplant center. A detailed discussion of the different prophylactic regimens is presented separately.

ATG induces T lymphocyte depletion in the peripheral blood primarily by complement-dependent cell lysis; it also contains some B cell-specific antibodies, inhibiting B cell proliferation and inducing B cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The reversal rate for acute rejection has been between 75 and 100 percent in different series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>], with the plasma creatinine concentration returning to baseline several days to a week after initiating therapy.</p><p>A direct comparison between rATG-Thymoglobulin and Atgam was performed in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of 163 renal transplant recipients with acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Compared with Atgam, rATG-Thymoglobulin resulted in a higher rate of reversal of rejection (88 versus 76 percent) and a lower rate of recurrent rejection at 90 days after antibody therapy (17 versus 36 percent). Patient and graft survival and the rates of adverse events and infections were similar between the two groups. Given the superior efficacy of rATG-Thymoglobulin in the treatment of acute rejection, Atgam is no longer used routinely in most transplant centers, although it is occasionally used in patients who have a known allergy to rabbits or rATG-Thymoglobulin when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> is not available.</p><p>The optimal dose and duration of rATG-Thymoglobulin therapy for the treatment of acute rejection is not well defined.

It is now recognized that more profound and durable lymphocyte depletion, which is believed to be one of the main mechanisms of action of rATG-Thymoglobulin, is achieved by administering larger but fewer doses over a shorter duration without interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alemtuzumab</a> is a humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody that is approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Only a few studies have examined this question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, 72 patients who were being treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and glucocorticoids were randomly assigned to biopsy at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months posttransplantation (biopsy group) or to biopsy at 6 and 12 months (control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Subclinical rejection discovered at months 1, 2, and 3 in the biopsy group was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. Compared with no treatment, corticosteroid therapy was associated with fewer episodes of acute rejection and with a lower serum creatinine concentration at two years (1.5 versus 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [133 versus 183 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, in a later multicenter study, 240 renal transplant recipients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, and glucocorticoids and randomly assigned to protocol biopsy arm or control arm, with subclinical rejection treated with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

If higher Banff grade TCMR is detected, we treat with appropriate therapy for the higher Banff grade, as described above. If the biopsy demonstrates evidence of ABMR, we initiate treatment for ABMR. If the biopsy reveals no evidence of an acute reversible process or reveals extensive fibrosis (indicating nonviable kidney tissue), we discontinue treatment of acute rejection.

We have found it useful to obtain a trichrome stain to assess fibrosis to help in this decision.

Other potential problems include acute hyperglycemia, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, and psychiatric disturbances including euphoria and depression. Prophylactic histamine-2 (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors as well as antifungal prophylaxis are generally recommended.</p><p>Bone disease is also common in renal transplant recipients, with the most important risk factor being the loss of bone density due to the cumulative dose of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The highest glucocorticoid-associated rates of bone loss are in the first 3 to 12 months after transplant. As most TCMR occurs within the first year posttransplant, further glucocorticoid treatment adds to the cumulative dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-disease-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone disease after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever and chills may develop in some patients during the initial rATG-Thymoglobulin infusion. Anaphylactic reactions, including respiratory distress and hypotension, are exceedingly rare. Administration of the concurrently given pulse glucocorticoids prior to rATG-Thymoglobulin will prevent or significantly reduce infusion-related reactions. Due to the risk of phlebitis, rATG-Thymoglobulin should generally be administered via central venous access; however, rATG-Thymoglobulin can be administered via peripheral line when the drug is mixed with heparin and patients are premedicated with an antihistamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A pruritic skin rash can occur in approximately 20 percent of patients treated with rATG-Thymoglobulin. Contamination of rATG-Thymoglobulin preparations with platelets and red blood cells can lead to antibody generation and the side effects of thrombocytopenia and, rarely, anemia. Thymoglobulin preparations also have antileukocyte immunoglobulin G (IgG), which can induce transient leukopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-t-cell-mediated-cellular-rejection-of-the-renal-allograft/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to the treatment of acute TCMR is guided predominantly by the Banff histologic grade of TCMR.

Subclinical rejection is detected on a surveillance or protocol biopsy in the absence of clinical symptoms or signs; at our institution, we do not perform protocol biopsies and, therefore, do not detect subclinical rejection.
