Continued growth leads in time to a clinically evident tumor mass. Unregulated cell division can result from mutations in both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.</p><p>Although thyroid epithelial tumors arise from the same cell type, they have diverse clinical characteristics. Most produce less thyroid hormone than normal thyroid tissue, but a few produce more. Most are adenomas, but some are slow-growing cancers, and a few are highly aggressive cancers.</p><p>An understanding of the mutations of the proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that occur in these tumors may explain the diverse clinical characteristics of thyroid tumors, provide diagnostic information, and direct therapy. Some insights have already emerged; some abnormalities in tumor genes are consistently associated with specific clinical and pathologic findings. These genetic abnormalities usually represent somatic (acquired) mutations, as opposed to inherited (germline) mutations. Most thyroid tumors are sporadic and not familial. This is different from the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes in which the primary tumorigenic gene mutations are inherited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and genetics of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the tumorigenic gene changes found in thyroid epithelial (nonmedullary) tumors. A summary of these changes is found in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68157 \">table 1</a>). Medullary thyroid cancer is included in this table for comparison but is discussed elsewhere, as are the characteristics and treatment of the specific tumors.

Clinically, they present as a single nodule that is hyperfunctioning (&quot;hot&quot;) on thyroid radionuclide scan, sometimes causing hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many of these tumors are caused by somatic mutations in genes that code for two proteins of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation cascade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81677\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81677 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TSH receptor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alpha subunit of the guanyl nucleotide stimulatory protein (Gs)</p><p/><p>Normally, TSH stimulates thyroid epithelial cells by binding to receptors on the plasma membrane of the cells. The signal is transduced by complexes formed between the alpha subunit of Gs and GTP in response to TSH-receptor binding. This results sequentially in stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, increased cyclic AMP production, and activation of protein kinases that stimulate thyroid cell division and hormone production. Adenylyl cyclase activity decreases when the GTP is hydrolyzed by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gs-alpha. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Activating mutations of the TSH receptor gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activating mutations of the TSH receptor produce constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase in the absence of TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The thyroid follicular cell with this TSH-receptor mutation divides and produces thyroid hormone without TSH stimulation, eventually becoming clinically recognized as a hot nodule. Although TSH (via the TSH receptor) also stimulates the inositol triphosphate pathway, most activating mutations of the TSH receptor do not stimulate signaling through this pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Among patients with an autonomously functioning thyroid adenoma, the frequency of TSH-receptor mutations in the adenoma varies from approximately 5 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. The large differences in frequency may be related to the sensitivity of the methods used to screen for the mutations or interpatient differences. Since the mutations are scattered throughout the receptor, studies of the entire receptor are most likely to identify a mutation. (In rare families, germline mutations in the TSH receptor cause hereditary hyperthyroidism, initially with a diffuse goiter but ultimately with a nodular goiter with multiple hot nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gs-alpha gene mutations that activate adenylyl cyclase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gs-alpha mutations that lead to adenylyl cyclase activation have the same effects on cell division and thyroid hormone production as those in the TSH receptor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81677\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81677 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These mutations code for changes in either an arginine residue at position 201 or a glutamine residue at position 227 of the molecule. The mutant Gs-alpha molecules have decreased GTPase activity; as a result, the Gs-alpha-GTP complex is more stable, leading to constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase.</p><p>Among autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas, these mutations are less common than TSH-receptor mutations, occurring in 0 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/7,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,11</a>].

Germline Gs-alpha mutations have not been reported and are probably lethal.</p><p>No autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas have been identified with mutations in both proteins, and some have no mutations in either.

The two types of studies, taken together, indicate that regions of phenotypic or functional heterogeneity can develop within a clonal thyroid nodule.</p><p>Multinodular goiters are occasionally familial, which means that the patient has at least one germline mutation. One familial form of nontoxic multinodular goiter has been linked to DNA markers on chromosome 14q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], but the etiologic gene is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular adenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As anticipated from pathologic studies, follicular adenomas are clonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Because defects in both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene are needed for tumor formation, it remains unclear whether inactivation of <em>PTEN</em> itself or a different tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 10q is a cause of sporadic follicular thyroid adenomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, including Cowden syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of follicular adenomas associated with external radiation are reported to have rearrangements of the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This is unexpected because <em>RET</em> mutations are rare in sporadic follicular adenomas or cancers.</p><p>Chromosomal translocations involving 19q13 and 2p21 are found in follicular adenomas and do not co-occur in the same neoplasm.
