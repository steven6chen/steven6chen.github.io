These patients may develop a unique syndrome consisting of septic arthritis (usually costochondral or sternoclavicular), endophthalmitis, and folliculitis involving the face, scalp, and chest.</p><p/><p>Among patients with osteomyelitis, the site of involvement varies with age. The vertebrae are most commonly involved in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/2,8,11,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,11,16-19</a>], whereas the long bones of the extremities are more likely to be involved in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. Of 207 cases of <em>Candida</em> osteomyelitis in adults and children, the most common sites of infection were the vertebra (in 51 percent), the femur (in 14 percent), the ribs (in 13 percent), and the sternum (in 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Among patients with septic arthritis, most infections have been described in native joints, but prosthetic joints can also be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>]. In a review of 112 patients (of whom 31 percent were children) with non-prosthetic joint <em>Candida</em> arthritis, the knee was involved in 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Approximately one-third of cases involved more than one joint, and another third were associated with adjacent osteomyelitis.

Both of these factors contribute to long delays in diagnosis, especially in patients with vertebral osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/1,2,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8-11</a>].</p><p>The most common symptom of <em>Candida</em> osteomyelitis is local pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/2,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,10</a>], and some patients also have tenderness, erythema, and edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Fever is present in less than one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Limitation of function and movement occurs in nearly one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Sinus tracts and purulent drainage occur in 32 percent of patients with non-vertebral osteomyelitis but in only 1 percent of patients with vertebral osteomyelitis.</p><p>In a literature review of 59 patients with <em>Candida</em> vertebral osteomyelitis, most patients (83 percent) had back pain for more than one month, and 29 percent had back pain for more than three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The primary site of involvement was the lower thoracic or lumbar spine in almost all patients. Approximately 20 percent had neurologic deficits.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in another review of 65 patients with <em>Candida</em> vertebral osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among the 40 patients with documented candidemia before the onset of osteomyelitis, the delay between the detection of candidemia and the onset of symptoms was 2 to 12 months in 70 percent and more than one year in 10 percent.</p><p>When a joint is infected, the major symptoms are pain, swelling, erythema, and decreased range of motion.

Two clinical clues are a history of or current or recent detection of candidemia and the presence of risk factors for <em>Candida</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/2,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,11</a>]. Among 207 patients with <em>Candida</em> osteomyelitis, 57 (28 percent) had preceding candidemia, and 31 (15 percent) had candidemia at the time of diagnosis with <em>Candida</em> osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among 112 patients with <em>Candida</em> arthritis, 63 percent had candidemia or other forms of candidiasis; however, only 11 percent were candidemic at the time the diagnosis of septic arthritis was made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In a review of 65 patients with vertebral osteomyelitis, all but three had at least one risk factor, and the median number of risk factors was three in patients with candidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most frequent risk factors were the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and central venous catheters.</p><p>In <em>Candida </em>osteoarticular infections, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are usually elevated; the white blood cell count is often normal or only mildly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Among imaging studies in patients with osteomyelitis, plain radiography can show erosive and destructive changes, but these changes may not be visible upon presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice, as it is in bacterial osteomyelitis. In a study of 207 patients with <em>Candida </em>osteomyelitis, MRI findings included decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images, increased signal intensity on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is established by culture of the infected site. <em>Candida</em> arthritis is more easily confirmed than osteomyelitis because synovial fluid can be readily obtained for culture. <em>Candida</em> species usually grow in a few days when plated on standard media, such as sheep's blood agar, or on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Even a single colony of <em>Candida</em> on culture of joint fluid or bone biopsy or aspirate should be viewed as pathogenic, and the patient should be treated with antifungal agents as described below.</p><p>Culture of <em>Candida</em> species from a chronic draining wound, as often occurs with <em>Candida</em> sternal osteomyelitis, is frequently disregarded as skin microbiota. However, repeated isolation of <em>Candida</em> and no other pathogen makes it likely that <em>Candida</em> is the causative agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Candida</em> septic arthritis in a native joint is easier to treat than osteomyelitis because adequate antifungal drug levels are more easily achieved in synovial fluid than in bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/1,12,20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,20,23,24</a>].</p><p>Fungal prosthetic joint infections are difficult to cure with medical therapy alone. Most patients with prosthetic joint infections require prosthesis removal followed by an extended course of antifungal therapy to resolve their infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Osteomyelitis is difficult to treat because the diagnosis is often delayed for weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>], the infected bone is often poorly perfused (which limits both the host inflammatory response and the delivery of antifungal drugs), and there may be foreign material present, as occurs with median sternotomy. Few data are available on the penetration of antifungal agents into bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Septic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate drainage is essential for the treatment of all cases of <em>Candida </em>septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The preferred approach is a two-stage procedure in which the infected prosthesis is removed, antifungal therapy is given, and a new prosthesis is implanted three to six months later; antifungal therapy should be continued for at least 12 weeks after the resection arthroplasty and for at least 6 weeks after the prosthesis is replaced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/21,26,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26,30-32</a>].</p><p>Although cures have been described with debridement without removal of the prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-osteoarticular-infections/abstract/12,13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,33</a>], this approach is not recommended for most patients with fungal infections.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> osteoarticular infections are most often due to hematogenous seeding of the joint or bone in patients who have been candidemic. The areas most often seeded during an episode of candidemia in adults are intervertebral discs and knee joints. Exogenous inoculation also can lead to infections after trauma, surgical procedures, or intra-articular injections. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms and sites of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoarticular infections often become symptomatic months after an episode of candidemia or a surgical procedure, and the manifestations are generally more subtle than bacterial infections at the same sites. Both of these factors contribute to long delays in diagnosis, especially in patients with vertebral osteomyelitis. The most common symptom of <em>Candida</em> osteomyelitis is local pain. When a joint is infected, the major symptoms are pain and decreased range of motion. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high index of suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis of <em>Candida</em> osteoarticular infections because the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings are not specific. The diagnosis is established by culture of the infected site. Even a single colony of <em>Candida</em> on culture of joint fluid or bone biopsy or aspirate should be viewed as pathogenic, and the patient should be treated with antifungal agents. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate drainage is essential for the treatment of all cases of <em>Candida</em> septic arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Septic arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antifungal treatment recommendations for septic arthritis include oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg])</span> daily for at least six weeks <strong>or</strong> an intravenous (IV) echinocandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caspofungin</a> 50 to 70 mg IV daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a> 100 mg IV daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a> 100 mg IV daily) daily for at least 2 weeks, followed by oral fluconazole (400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg])</span> daily for at least 4 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87679 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Septic arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to antifungal drugs, the cure of prosthetic joint infections almost always requires removal of all prosthetic material. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prosthetic joint infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment recommendations for osteomyelitis include oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg])</span> daily for 6 to 12 months <strong>or</strong> an IV echinocandin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caspofungin</a> 50 to 70 mg IV daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">micafungin</a> 100 mg IV daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a> 100 mg IV daily) daily for at least 2 weeks followed by oral fluconazole (400 mg [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg])</span> for 6 to 12 months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87679 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical debridement plays an important role in the treatment of <em>Candida</em> osteomyelitis involving non-vertebral sites, but the role of surgical debridement for vertebral osteomyelitis is less clear. Most authors note efficacy with antifungal therapy alone although some favor debridement. Surgery is clearly indicated if there is an associated epidural abscess or instability of the spine. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Osteomyelitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antifungal regimens for non-albicans <em>Candida</em> infections are discussed above.
