Prevalence estimates vary widely among studies because of differences in the definition of hypertension and in methods of measuring blood pressure (BP; ie, either before and after dialysis or using ambulatory BP recordings). Based upon multiple studies, over 50 to 60 percent of hemodialysis patients (up to 85 percent in some reports) and nearly 30 percent of peritoneal dialysis patients are hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. In one multicenter trial that included 2535 adult hemodialysis patients, the prevalence of hypertension, defined as one-week average predialysis systolic BP measurements 150 mmHg or diastolic BP 85 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive medications, was 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Hypertension is more common among patients who are just initiating dialysis (greater than 80 percent) because almost all such patients are volume overloaded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Persistent hypertension often reflects inadequate volume control despite the initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume expansion is the major cause of hypertension in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Volume overload leads to an elevation in blood pressure (BP) via the combination of a rise in cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. The role of volume expansion is supported by studies that have shown increases in predialysis but not postdialysis plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations in hypertensive individuals whose BP responded to ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The removal of the excess sodium and reduction in target dry weight can result in the normalization of BP in &gt;60 percent of hemodialysis patients and in many peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7,14-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14-20</a>].</p><p>Sympathetic overactivity, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and arteriosclerosis also contribute to hypertension in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Other potential contributors include changes in endothelium-derived vasoactive peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>], increases in intracellular calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], and decreases in renalase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Renalase is a catecholamine-metabolizing enzyme released by the kidney in response to catecholamine surge.</p><p>Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or the use of drugs such as nasal decongestants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or illicit drugs such as cocaine may also play roles in individual patients, as in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7,11,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary hypertension'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H508184876\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among hemodialysis patients, ABPM provides reproducible readings and correlates with outcomes but is generally not used clinically, as it is too cumbersome and poorly suited to day-to-day management of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p>We use self-recorded home blood pressure (BP) monitoring to monitor BP and diagnose hypertension. Self-recorded home BP readings are efficient, accurate, and correlate with ABPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/33,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36,37</a>] and with outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>].</p><p>We do not use pre- and postdialysis BP measurements to diagnose hypertension or titrate antihypertensive therapy, although BP is closely monitored throughout the dialysis treatment to assess the hemodynamic stability of the patient during the treatment. The pre- or postdialysis BP readings do not correlate with ABPM or with clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Predialysis BP readings tend to overestimate and postdialysis readings underestimate BP readings obtained by ABPM, and the degree of bias is variable. In one systematic review of studies, compared with 44-hour ABPM, predialysis systolic BP was variably 42 mmHg higher or 25 mmHg lower, and postdialysis systolic BP was 33 mmHg higher to 36 mmHg lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>By contrast to pre- and postdialysis readings, BP readings obtained outside the dialysis unit (either by ABPM or self-recorded home measurement) are directly related to all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. As an example, a 2015 study showed that a single recording of systolic BP measured outside the dialysis unit was directly related to mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.40) for every 10 mmHg increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>If ABPM is used to confirm home-recorded BP readings, it is best performed over 44 hours during the interdialytic period to account for volume-related increases in BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/33,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,37</a>]. ABPM generally shows a linear increase in BP as volume accrues.</p><p>The optimal frequency of monitoring is not known. We suggest home BP monitoring at monthly intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/36,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF TREATING HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies and meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials in dialysis patients have suggested a benefit of using antihypertensive agents to lower blood pressure (BP) on cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]. The best data are from two meta-analyses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis of eight randomized, controlled trials that enrolled 1679 dialysis patients found that lowering BP with antihypertensive therapy was associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular events (relative risk [RR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.92), all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.96), and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second 2009 meta-analysis including five randomized trials with 1202 hemodialysis patients showed that, compared with placebo or control therapy, BP lowering with antihypertensive therapy resulted in a 31 percent reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal blood pressure (BP) goal and the interventions that are available to treat hypertension in dialysis patients are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3601356681\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure target</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The threshold BP that should be treated is not known with certainty. BP target ranges for dialysis patients have been extrapolated from studies in the nondialysis patient population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There have been no randomized, prospective trials evaluating the target BP in dialysis patients. We suggest maintaining interdialytic self-recorded home BP of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/80</span> mmHg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a prospective cohort study that included 150 hemodialysis patients, the best mortality outcomes were observed with a home measurement of a systolic BP of 125 to 145 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Some studies have suggested that excessively low systemic pressures are associated with increased mortality (a so-called J- or U-shaped curve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/42,43,47,53-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43,47,53-59</a>] and with a higher risk of hemoaccess thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>]. However, all of these studies employed pre- or postdialysis BP measurements, which do not correlate with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). In addition, these studies did not distinguish between spontaneous lowering of BP and deliberate reduction in BP. Spontaneous lowering of BP may occur due to intercurrent illnesses such as infection, cancer, myocardial disease, or liver disease and is expected to be associated with increased mortality. Many studies did not even provide information on antihypertensive medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1980489376\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment interventions include reducing the target dry weight in an effort to achieve euvolemia and antihypertensive medications. If possible, the target dry weight should be adjusted before antihypertensive agents are added. However, patients are often on multiple antihypertensive agents when they start maintenance dialysis. Among such patients, the approach will vary depending on severity of hypertension and hemodynamic stability during dialysis. As an example, in some patients, ultrafiltration is limited because of intradialytic hypotension; such patients may benefit from tapering antihypertensive agents. In other patients who have severe hypertension, antihypertensive agents may need to be continued while the target dry weight is gradually reduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Achieving optimal dry weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reducing the target dry weight can normalize the BP or make the hypertension easier to control in the great majority of dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/17,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,63</a>]. The exact definition of target dry weight remains uncertain, but multiple definitions have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. We believe that the best definition of dry weight is the lowest tolerated postdialysis weight at which there are minimal signs or symptoms of either hypovolemia or hypervolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292493024\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of volume status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient history and physical examination are generally used to determine the optimal target dry weight. The patient should be questioned about interdialytic symptoms that suggest orthostatic hypotension (such as lightheadedness) and intradialytic symptoms such as muscular cramps that may suggest that the target dry weight is too low.</p><p>A physical examination is generally performed at the beginning of dialysis and includes an assessment for presence of increased jugular venous pulse, peripheral or pulmonary edema, and ascites (suggesting volume overload) at a given weight and BP.</p><p>Unfortunately, one problem with a reliance upon a clinical assessment of volume status is that volume expansion may persist even among those thought to have attained euvolemia.</p><p>Methods to more accurately assess dry weight include bioimpedance plethysmography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], relative plasma volume (RPV) monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>], measurement of the inferior cava diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>], and plasma natriuretic peptides (particularly atrial and B-type) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. These methods are not commonly used clinically, although studies have suggested utility, particularly of bioimpedance plethysmography and RPV monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].</p><p>Other methods for determining dry weight have not been compared with clinical assessment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/70,74,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,74,76,77</a>]. Until such methods are validated, the clinician must define the dry weight and goal BP for each dialysis patient based upon his or her best judgment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4230467084\"><span class=\"h3\">How to reduce target dry weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reduction in dry weight is best done gradually. We reduce the target weight over days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7,14,15,20,49,78-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,15,20,49,78-82</a>]. In a patient who is just starting maintenance hemodialysis who is either hypertensive (as defined above) or on antihypertensive agents, we reduce the target dry weight by 0.5 L per session. In patients who are unable to tolerate this, we attempt 0.2 L per session. (See <a href=\"#H3601356681\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure target'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients should avoid large interdialytic weight gain (ideally &lt;2 to 3 L) in order to limit the amount of fluid that needs to be removed in an individual session; a patient who gains 5 liters in between dialysis sessions will have difficulty achieving the previous target dry weight, which generally precludes removing an additional 0.5 L to achieve a lower target dry weight.</p><p>The best way to limit interdialytic weight gain is to limit salt intake. Salt intake drives thirst. It is not helpful to restrict fluid without restricting salt.</p><p>All patients should adhere to a restricted salt diet (1500 to 2000 mg of <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/49,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,83,84</a>]. However, patient compliance is often suboptimal.</p><p>In some patients, it is difficult to reduce the target dry weight. In such patients, we use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increase dialysis time </strong>&ndash; Increasing the length or frequency of sessions is often effective in reducing target dry weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The utility of lengthier dialysis sessions was demonstrated in a large dialysis center in Tassin, France, where a standard regimen is eight hours, three times per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/15,86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,86-88</a>]. This regimen was associated with the maintenance of normotension without medications in almost all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/15,86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,86-88</a>]. The improved BP was largely attributed to optimal volume control, although other factors may contribute, such as decreased afferent renal nerve activity and efferent sympathetic activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, this regimen is not widely used in in-center hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;, section on 'Adequacy of dialysis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efficacy of more frequent dialysis in achieving BP control is demonstrated by nocturnal hemodialysis, in which dialysis is performed six or seven nights a week during sleep (usually 6 to 12 hours in total) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Almost all patients become normotensive without medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Short daily hemodialysis may also be associated with better BP control.

This results in volume overload and increased thirst. A lower dialysate sodium concentration may result in lower antihypertensive medication requirements and decreased BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The dialysate sodium should be reduced gradually (ie, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> every three to four weeks) to approximately 136 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dialysate sodium may be reduced in a fixed or variable fashion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A variable reduction in dialysate sodium on BP was evaluated in one randomized, crossover study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. A programmed decrease in sodium dialysate concentration from 155 to 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> was compared with the standard stable sodium dialysate concentration of 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Postdialysis BP and antihypertensive use were reduced when patients were dialyzed with a variable sodium prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A fixed lower dialysate sodium concentration in combination with sodium restriction was evaluated in a small, uncontrolled study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Eight hypertensive hemodialysis patients were dialyzed against a gradually lowered sodium dialysate concentration (140 to 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> at a rate of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> every three to four weeks) and were encouraged to limit salt intake to &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. At study end, the mean arterial pressure was lower, and antihypertensive medications were no longer required in four patients. However, adherence to the diet was difficult, and the frequency of muscle cramps during dialysis was increased. This regimen engenders the risk of episodic hypotension and should be instituted cautiously (ie, with close observation).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihypertensive medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the above interventions, many, if not most, hemodialysis patients will require antihypertensive agents. In one multicenter trial, 88 percent of the hemodialysis patients received antihypertensive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As noted above, the administration of antihypertensive agents may provide significant clinical benefits, including improved mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertension-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

Self-recorded home BP readings are efficient, accurate, and correlate with readings obtained by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). We do not use pre- and postdialysis BP measurements to diagnose hypertension and inform antihypertensive therapy, since these measurements do not correlate with ABPM or with clinical outcomes. The optimal frequency of screening is not known. We suggest home BP monitoring at monthly intervals.

We reduce the target weight over days to weeks. Patients should avoid large interdialytic weight gain. Some patients require an increase in frequency of dialysis to achieve optimal dry weight. If these measures failure to reduce BP, we reduce the dialysate sodium concentration.
