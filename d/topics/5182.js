It is most often due to alveolar rupture resulting in the release of air into extra-alveolar locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pulmonary barotrauma may be associated with increased mortality and in some circumstances it may be life-threatening. Thus, it is important that clinicians prevent, recognize, and promptly manage barotrauma in this population. </p><p>The prevention, diagnostic evaluation, and management of pulmonary barotrauma are discussed in this topic review. Additional complications of mechanical ventilation are described separately.

Pulmonary barotrauma from invasive mechanical ventilation refers to alveolar rupture due to elevated transalveolar pressure (the alveolar pressure minus the pressure in the adjacent interstitial space); air leaks into extra-alveolar tissue resulting in conditions including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema. (See <a href=\"#H2155328928\" class=\"local\">'Alveolar rupture'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation and management'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Although not true barotrauma, direct injury to the alveolar or pleural space (eg, from chest trauma or biopsy) results in conditions that present and are managed similarly.

The normal respiratory cycle during spontaneous breathing is dependent upon negative pressure. In contrast, invasive mechanical ventilation involves the delivery of positive pressure. Positive pressure ventilation causes barotrauma by increasing transalveolar pressure (ie, alveolar pressure minus the pressure in the adjacent interstitial space), which results in alveolar rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Alveolar rupture allows air from the alveolus to enter the pulmonary interstitium. The interstitial air can then dissect along the perivascular sheaths toward the pleural space, mediastinum, peritoneum, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin, leading to pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcutaneous emphysema, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67176 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53642\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53642 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Types of breaths'</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of barotrauma in patients who receive noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which also delivers positive pressure, is likely similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. However, such instances are rare probably because airway pressures associated with NIV are lower when compared with invasive mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Potential harms'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2586483254\"><span class=\"h4\">Elevated pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barotrauma refers to trauma induced by high pressures, while volutrauma refers to injury induced by overdistension of the lung during mechanical ventilation. It is likely that both phenomena contribute to the pathogenesis of ruptured alveoli during mechanical ventilation. However, limiting alveolar pressure appears to be the most effective way of preventing barotrauma suggesting that high alveolar pressures play a dominant role in alveolar rupture. </p><p>Ventilator pressures that increase the risk of barotrauma include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevated plateau pressure</strong> &ndash; The plateau pressure (Pplat) represents the pressure applied to the small airways and alveoli. There is no absolute Pplat above or below which barotrauma does or does not occur but, in general, the higher the Pplat, the greater the risk of barotrauma with the highest rates occurring in those with a Pplat &gt;35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Data to support this threshold are derived from a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials (2270 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and demonstrated a strong relationship between pulmonary barotrauma and a Pplat &gt;35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or a static compliance &lt;30 mL per cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Conversely, the lower the Pplat, the lower the risk of barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pplat is not routinely displayed. To determine Pplat, the clinician must apply an inspiratory breath hold (usually 0.5 to 1 second) to the ventilated patient and measure the airway pressure during the breath hold. In our practice, we follow the Pplat daily and also intermittently measure it when peak pressures are elevated. Targeting the ideal Pplat during mechanical ventilation to prevent barotrauma is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1064990298\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevated peak pressure</strong> &ndash; Similar to Pplat, there is no absolute threshold for the peak pressure (Ppeak; also known as peak inspiratory pressure [PIP]), above which barotrauma occurs and in general, the lower the better. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ppeak is routinely displayed on most ventilators and is the highest airway pressure measured during each respiratory cycle. It represents the total pressure needed to overcome the inspiratory flow resistance, elastic recoil of the lung and chest wall, and the alveolar pressure that exists at the beginning of each breath. Thus, Ppeak is partly determined by Pplat, such that when the Ppeak is &gt;35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and largely due to an elevated Pplat, the risk of barotrauma is likely elevated. Similarly, when Pplat is elevated to the same degree as Ppeak, then patients are at risk of alveolar overdistension and, therefore, barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ppeak is higher than the Pplat, with the difference between the two values being related to airway resistance. Larger differences indicate more airway resistance (eg, asthma exacerbation). Determining the contributions of airway resistance and plateau pressure to Ppeak is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults-with-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma#H200905730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive mechanical ventilation in adults with acute exacerbations of asthma&quot;, section on 'Differentiating airway and lung parenchymal causes of high pressures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Conflicting data on the value of Ppeak as a predictor of barotrauma suggest that Ppeak is probably a less reliable predictor than Pplat of pulmonary barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Several studies found that Ppeak did not predict pulmonary barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients due to a variety of etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. In contrast, one study found that the Ppeak is often elevated prior to the development of pulmonary barotrauma and another study found that pulmonary barotrauma did not occur in patients whose peak airway pressures were less than 50 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High levels of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP</strong>) &ndash; In the past, most experts traditionally considered high levels of PEEP as a potential risk factor for barotrauma based upon the rationale that in ARDS, high levels can result in overdistension in regions of the lung not involved with ARDS. However, several studies have reported that open lung ventilation strategies using high levels of PEEP or recruitment maneuvers, have not been shown to increase the risk of barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/4,24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24-30</a>]. This is probably because most open lung approaches also concomitantly use lung protection strategies (ie, low tidal volume with a target plateau pressure &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and perhaps because the application of PEEP appropriately recruited involved atelectatic lung, thereby improving lung compliance. Thus, we believe that high levels of PEEP may increase the risk of barotrauma only when this strategy is ineffective in recruiting ARDS-affected atelectatic lung, or not performed together with lung protective ventilation. These ventilatory approaches and determining the optimal level of PEEP are discussed separately.

The increased risk likely relates to increased alveolar pressure. Those with dynamic hyperinflation (eg, acute exacerbation of COPD or asthma), or low lung compliance (end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, severe ARDS) appear to be at highest risk. </p><p>Others include patients who develop prolonged increases in plateau pressure from central airway obstruction, mainstem bronchus intubation, or bronchoscopy during mechanical ventilation, patients with overdistended lung due to overventilation (eg, aggressive bag-mask ventilation during resuscitation or over ventilating pneumonectomized patients), those with cavitating lung disease (eg, from bacterial or pneumocystis pneumonia), or those with underlying cystic lung disease (eg, Langerhans cell histiocytosis). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2701427697\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not true barotrauma, direct injury to the alveolar or pleural space in some mechanically ventilated patients may result in the escape of air to surrounding tissue resulting in conditions that present and are managed similarly.

Although no single strategy prevents barotrauma, we typically use lung protective ventilatory approaches by limiting plateau pressure (Pplat) &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and using low tidal volume ventilation (6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> ideal body weight [IBW]). Additional principles of prevention include the avoidance of overventilation, adopting measures to avoid or treat dynamic hyperinflation (auto-positive end expiratory pressure [PEEP]), and the cautious use of high levels of PEEP. The risk of barotrauma is not eliminated until the underlying predisposing condition is resolved and the patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74558 \">table 2</a>).

Data to support these thresholds are derived from patients with ARDS where maintaining a Pplat &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (together with low tidal volume ventilation) is associated with improved mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Noteworthy, is that although this strategy has not been shown to reduce the rate of barotrauma (approximately 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], lower pressures in other studies have been associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary barotrauma such that targeting Pplat as low as is feasible is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Conversely, the incidence of pulmonary barotrauma increases significantly in patients with a Pplat &gt;35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and should be avoided, when feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Occasionally, a Pplat between 31 and 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is used by experts, when necessary, acknowledging that the risk of barotrauma is increased in this setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2139766563\"><span class=\"h2\">Low tidal volume ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This approach is based upon the rationale that overventilation is a risk factor for barotrauma and that this strategy reduces mortality in patients with ARDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/3,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,34</a>]. While low tidal volumes can induce hypercapnia, this is often an accepted consequence and is well tolerated when the pH is acceptable. In general, we use tidal volumes of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> IBW in high risk patients particularly those with ARDS, but also in those with COPD, asthma, and chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Disease-related'</a> above).

DHI is characterized by increased levels of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi or &quot;auto-PEEP&quot;). The hyperinflation is progressive (dynamic) because air accumulates in the lung with each breath as a result of a failure to achieve complete exhalation before the onset of the next breath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78052 \">figure 3</a>). The prevention and treatment of DHI are primarily achieved through a reduction in respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tidal volume (ie, reducing minute ventilation) and shortening inspiratory time (both prolonging expiratory time), as well as treating the underlying airflow obstruction when present.

Signs and symptoms range from an asymptomatic or atypical finding on routine chest radiography to tachypnea, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress, and profound hypoxemia, and rarely, hemodynamic collapse, obstructive shock, or death.

Physical findings may include tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, hypertension, or hypoxemia accompanied by a new unilateral reduction of breath sounds. Ventilator asynchrony, acute elevation of peak and plateau pressures, and an acute reduction in expired tidal volume may be noted. Tension pneumothorax should be suspected in those who also have distended neck veins, tracheal deviation away from the affected side, and hypotension or shock. Although iatrogenic-induced pneumothorax is not ventilator-induced, the presenting features and management principles are often the same. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The differential diagnosis and assessment of mechanically ventilated patients who develop respiratory distress are discussed separately.

Unless tension pneumothorax is suspected, a portable chest radiograph should be performed, although computed tomography is sometimes required. When available, ultrasonography is particularly useful when rapid diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment with tube thoracostomy is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Chest radiography</strong> &ndash; Chest radiography for the diagnosis of pneumothorax in ventilated patients poses certain challenges. Pneumothorax on an upright chest radiograph in a spontaneously breathing patient most often reveals an apical white visceral pleural line which is separated from the parietal pleura by a collection of gas (ie, a radiolucent space with no lung markings). However, in ventilated patients, portable chest radiographs are obtained with the patient semirecumbent or supine, such that free air collects anteriorly or in a subpulmonic location, resulting in atypical findings (free air will rise superiorly and follow the path of least resistance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Gas in the subpulmonic location outlines the anterior pleural reflection, the anterolateral border of the mediastinum, and the costophrenic sulcus creating the &quot;deep sulcus&quot; sign or the &quot;double diaphragm&quot; sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F90382\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90382 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F90377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90377 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53642\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53642 \">image 1</a>). Air in this location may also result in a &quot;continuous diagram&quot; where the diaphragm is seen as one continuous line through both the right and left hemithorax. On rare occasions, pneumothoraces are bilateral and may have evidence of gas in other locations (eg, subcutaneous, or mediastinal).

Utilizing the M-mode, the absence of &quot;lung sliding&quot; is indicative of the presence of a pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Ultrasonography may also be useful to guide chest tube placement. Identifying a pneumothorax via ultrasound is discussed in greater detail separately.

Rapid clinical improvement following empiric aspiration of a suspected tension pneumothorax is considered by most experts as diagnostic.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Tube thoracostomy</strong> &ndash; There is a paucity of evidence to help guide the clinician regarding the decision to place a chest tube for the drainage of pleural air in mechanically ventilated patients. In general, we have a low threshold for thoracostomy tube placement based upon our observation that more than 30 percent of pneumothoraces in mechanically ventilated patients progress to tension pneumothoraces. Immediate insertion of a chest tube is indicated for suspected tension pneumothorax. Tube thoracostomy is also appropriate if the pneumothorax is symptomatic, impairs gas exchange or is large, persistent, or progressive. Further details regarding chest tube management (placement, duration, location, size, ultrasonography assistance), and management of persistent air leaks and bronchopleural fistulas are described separately.

Physical findings may include tachycardia, tachypnea, or hypertension. A crunching sound is occasionally heard during cardiac auscultation. Hypotension due to decreased venous return and cardiac output may occur if tension pneumomediastinum develops, although this is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Pneumomediastinum may be found incidentally, in isolation, or in conjunction with pneumothorax on chest radiography. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Pneumomediastinum is also usually diagnosed with a portable chest radiograph. It appears as radiolucent streaks in the mediastinum. Free air tracking along normal anatomic structures (eg, trachea, heart) may outline those structures. However, if accumulations are small, it may only be detected by CT chest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When found radiographically, other etiologies should be considered including a ruptured esophagus (eg, previous vomiting, nasogastric tube placement), trauma, endobronchial fracture, or mediastinitis from gas-producing organisms. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; Pneumomediastinum due to pulmonary barotrauma is generally self-limited and typically resolves with a reduction in ventilatory pressures, and close monitoring (clinically and radiographic). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pneumothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A notable exception is the rare patient who develops tension pneumomediastinum, in whom a mediastinotomy with drainage of air should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Examination findings may be subtle and may include abdominal distension, tenderness, or tympany. Abdominal compartment syndrome may develop if the pneumoperitoneum progresses to a tension pneumoperitoneum, but this is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Retroperitoneal air can also cause back pain.

When feasible, the patient should remain in position for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before the CT is performed to allow the air to collect in sufficient volume to be detected radiographically. When plain film abdominal radiography is used, free air accumulates superiorly (ie, underneath the diaphragm) when the patient is upright, and anteriorly when the patient is supine; anterior accumulation of air appears as gas on both sides of the bowel wall (Rigler's sign), gas outlining the falciform ligament, gas outlining the peritoneal cavity (Football sign), gas outlining the medial umbilical folds (inverted V sign), or gas localized in the right upper quadrant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Since pulmonary barotrauma is a rare cause of pneumoperitoneum, other etiologies should be considered for which CT may also be useful. These include a ruptured viscus, abdominal trauma, recent abdominal laparoscopy or surgery, peritoneal dialysis, paracentesis, vaginal procedures, bacterial peritonitis, pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, and bowel malignancy. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Management</strong> &ndash; Pneumoperitoneum due to pulmonary barotrauma is usually self-limited and often resolves spontaneously with a reduction in ventilatory pressures, monitoring, and supportive measures. An exception is the rare patient who develops abdominal compartment syndrome due to tension pneumoperitoneum. In case reports, most patients were managed with surgical decompression because this approach relieved the abdominal compartment syndrome and excluded gastrointestinal perforation as the etiology. Management of abdominal compartment syndrome due to tension pneumoperitoneum is similar to the management of abdominal compartment syndrome due to other causes, which is discussed separately.

Compartment syndrome is a rare consequence of severe subcutaneous emphysema (ie, compression of blood supply such that life-threatening ischemia may occur) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Subcutaneous emphysema is often identified by finding crepitus during physical examination. It can also be seen on a plain radiograph.

Surgical decompression involves creating one or more sterile surgical incisions (&quot;blowhole incision&quot;), usually 1 to 2 inches long through the dermis of the anterior chest wall to allow air to escape; air may be heard escaping through the skin and occasionally gentle massage of air through subcutaneous tissue can encourage decompression. Incisions may be left loosely covered with sterile gauze until healing has occurred. Subcutaneous drain placement and blow hole incisions with negative pressure wound therapy have also been reported for severe cases or for palliation of symptoms, although none of these techniques are validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817991046\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare manifestations of barotrauma include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary interstitial emphysema</strong> &ndash; Pulmonary interstitial emphysema can be detected in ARDS patients or explanted lung specimens, particularly when usual interstitial pneumonia from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is present. Air dissects through the alveolar walls into adjacent interstitial tissues to form an inflammatory reaction. While often asymptomatic, pulmonary interstitial emphysema can result in the development of air cysts within the lung parenchyma and air embolism, as well as other forms as barotrauma such as pneumothorax, which should be treated accordingly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

All patients must be monitored closely by routine clinical examination and assessment of vital signs and ventilator settings. While some physicians perform serial chest radiography (eg, every 8 to 12 hours until the patient is stable or has no signs of progression), we generally perform routine daily imaging and imaging that is symptom-directed. When air is not drained, it resorbs slowly and evidence of barotrauma may remain on radiographs for days to weeks. </p><p>For those in whom a thoracostomy tube is placed, some require tube repositioning or replacement, or additional tubes if followup imaging reveals an incomplete response or no response. Using the least amount or no chest tube suction to maintain lung inflation is typically preferred in order to reduce the risk of developing a persistent leak or bronchopleural fistula. The management of persistent air leaks and bronchopleural fistula are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H1032319\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Persistent air leakage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchopleural fistula in patients on mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The decision to remove thoracostomy tubes in ventilated patients is challenging and individualized, especially if they remain mechanically ventilated and the underlying disorder remains acutely active. We generally only remove them when the pneumothorax has completely resolved, the patient is clinically stable, and is successfully weaning (eg, low plateau pressure, minimal ventilator settings, on tracheostomy and ready for a long term care facility) or has weaned from mechanical ventilation (ie, extubated). Additional indications to remove chest tubes also include difficulty weaning due to pleural pain or infection from the chest tube itself or in those with direct injury to the pleural space (eg, pneumothorax due to central line placement).

However, barotrauma is not the direct cause of death in most patients; it is possible that it is a marker for more severe illness such that sicker patients may have a higher plateau airway pressure and are therefore more likely to develop pulmonary barotrauma as a result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed populations</strong> &ndash; In a multicenter, prospective cohort study of a mixed population of mechanically ventilated patients, those with barotrauma had a significantly higher mortality (51 versus 39 percent), longer length of intensive care unit stay (median nine versus seven days), and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (median six versus four days) than patients without barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one retrospective cohort study of 1700 mechanically ventilated patients, mortality approached 100 percent when pulmonary barotrauma caused a large (&gt;500 mL per breath) bronchopleural fistula or when barotrauma was a later manifestation during the patients illness (eg, at 14 days as opposed to within first 24 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ARDS</strong> &ndash; In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the impact of barotrauma on outcome is less certain due to conflicting data. In a retrospective cohort study of 84 patients with severe ARDS, mortality was significantly higher among patients with pneumothorax than among those without pneumothorax (66 versus 46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In contrast, a retrospective analysis of data collected during a randomized trial of 725 patients with ARDS found no significant difference in mortality among patients with pneumothorax, compared to patients without pneumothorax (46 versus 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another retrospective study, patients with pneumomediastinum due to barotrauma were found to have a risk of mortality greater than those with pneumomediastinum due to other causes, such as blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary barotrauma from invasive mechanical ventilation refers to alveolar rupture due to elevated transalveolar pressure. Estimates suggest that the incidence of barotrauma is approximately 10 percent or less. While direct injury to the alveolar or pleural space is not true barotrauma, the resulting conditions (eg, pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum) present and are managed similarly. (See <a href=\"#H2780826784\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1291937094\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients on mechanical ventilation are at risk of barotrauma, particularly those with elevated plateau pressures &gt;35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are independent risk factors for pulmonary barotrauma. These and other causes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79654\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79654 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No single strategy prevents barotrauma. We typically use lung protective ventilatory strategies by limiting plateau pressure (Pplat) &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and using low tidal volume ventilation (eg, 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> ideal body weight [IBW]). We also use measures to avoid or treat dynamic hyperinflation (eg, lower minute ventilation, shorten inspiratory time, treat obstruction). These and other measures are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74558 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1064990298\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common manifestations include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema, or combinations thereof. Signs and symptoms range from an asymptomatic finding on routine chest radiography to tachypnea, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress, profound hypoxemia, and hemodynamic collapse. Ventilator asynchrony, acute elevation of peak and plateau pressures and an acute reduction in the expired tidal volume may also be noted. Pulmonary barotrauma is typically diagnosed radiographically, but physical examination is also appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H3230018634\" class=\"local\">'Barotrauma diagnosis and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For mechanically ventilated patients who develop pulmonary barotrauma, we suggest that the Pplat be immediately lowered (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An appropriate goal is a Pplat &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. This may require lowering the tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure as well as increasing sedation (including neuromuscular blockade). Additional therapies may involve managing the specific consequence of the barotrauma (eg, tube thoracostomy) and treating the underlying medical condition (eg, bronchodilators for asthma). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H895009405\" class=\"local\">'Management of underlying disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once therapies have been instituted, patients should have an arterial blood gas within one hour so that further ventilator adjustments can be made, if necessary. All patients must be monitored closely by routine clinical examination, and regular assessment of vital signs, ventilator settings, and radiography data.
