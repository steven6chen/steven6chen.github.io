An episode of unipolar major depression is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most or all activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, guilt or thoughts of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>).

In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonic features, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Treating major depression with psychotic features or catatonia is discussed separately.

The presence of these somatic symptoms should be evaluated in the context of normal expectations for pregnancy. As an example, although food aversions can occur during pregnancy, patients with anorexia who fail to gain weight may have mild to moderate depression, and pregnant patients with anorexia who lose weight may have severe depression. In the same vein, pregnancy can cause fatigue. However, lack of energy to the point that patients need to make a significant effort to initiate or maintain usual daily activities can be a mild to moderate depressive symptom, and anergia to the point that patients cannot get out of bed for hours is probably a symptom of severe depression. Persistent uncertainty as to whether an episode of major depression is mild to moderate or severe can be resolved by referral to a psychiatrist (preferably one specializing in perinatal disorders).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2792388325\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles and issues that are involved in treating unipolar major depression during pregnancy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating patients and families</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribing antidepressants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing nonresponse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making referrals</p><p/><p>These general principles are discussed in detail separately.

Patients start with initial therapy and progress through each step until they respond. The primary treatments are antidepressant medications. In addition, psychotherapy is nearly always indicated as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy, unless symptoms render the patient incapable of participating. </p><p>The duration of an adequate trial with antidepressant medications is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment#H21696522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Duration of an adequate trial'</a>.)</p><p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is frequently indicated for patients with psychotic features, catatonia, high risk of suicide, and fluid and food refusal leading to dehydration and malnutrition. In addition, severe, antenatal unipolar major depression that does not respond to multiple antidepressant trials is often treated with ECT. (See <a href=\"#H938487983\" class=\"local\">'Electroconvulsive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Continuation treatment is generally indicated for patients who respond to acute treatment of unipolar major depression, and additional maintenance treatment is indicated for patients with an increased risk of recurrence.

Using antidepressants is consistent with several practice guidelines, including those from the American Psychiatric Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; the general consensus is that the benefits of antidepressants outweigh the potential risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/8-10,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,13-17</a>]. Antidepressants are frequently used to treat prenatal unipolar major depression; in a nationally representative survey of pregnant women with major depression in the United States (n = 375), treatment with pharmacotherapy was reported by 40 percent, more than any other treatment modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The choice of antidepressant depends primarily upon the prior treatment history. (See <a href=\"#H3807951204\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an antidepressant'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Nevertheless, psychotherapy is a reasonable alternative to antidepressants for severe antenatal depression in patients with a prior history of poor response to multiple antidepressants, or if patients decline pharmacotherapy after weighing the risks (see <a href=\"#H2096812256\" class=\"local\">'Weighing the risks'</a> below). Psychotherapy is appropriate provided that the depressive syndrome does not include suicidal ideation or obvious impairment of function. If patients do not respond to psychotherapy after several sessions (eg, eight), we switch patients to antidepressants.</p><p>Although no randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy or safety of antidepressants during pregnancy, numerous trials that excluded pregnant patients have demonstrated the efficacy of antidepressants for treating the general population of patients with major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

There is no compelling evidence that the safety of fetal exposure differs among antidepressants. The one exception is monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are not used during pregnancy.

Nevertheless, safety concerns regarding ECT necessitate preprocedure obstetric consultation (consistent with guideline recommendation), with emphasis upon assessing risk factors for vaginal bleeding, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, abruption, and uteroplacental insufficiency due to the association of ECT with transient increases or decreases in blood pressure and uterine contractions. The patient&rsquo;s general medical status is also evaluated. Medical consultation prior to ECT is discussed separately, as is the use of ECT for patients with general medical conditions.

However, a reasonable alternative is to discontinue pharmacotherapy and to begin psychotherapy as maintenance treatment. If psychotherapy is successful as maintenance treatment for a period of time (eg, six months), patients can then attempt to conceive, and psychotherapy is continued during the pregnancy. For women with a more benign course of illness, it is reasonable to either continue pharmacotherapy, or to discontinue their antidepressants and begin psychotherapy, based upon their values and preferences. The efficacy of switching from pharmacotherapy to psychotherapy as maintenance treatment (called &ldquo;sequential treatment&rdquo;) in the general population of depressed patients is discussed separately, as is the choice of psychotherapy.

As an example, one prospective observational study in a perinatal psychiatry program enrolled euthymic, pregnant women with a prepregnancy history of major depression, who were either currently taking antidepressants (primarily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or had recently (&lt;12 weeks prior to last menstrual period) discontinued them for at least one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Among patients who maintained antidepressants throughout the pregnancy (n = 82) or who discontinued antidepressants (n = 65), relapse occurred in fewer patients who continued treatment (26 versus 68 percent). The investigators also found that among patients who stopped treatment, reintroducing antidepressants attenuated the risk of relapse, but not entirely. </p><p>The increased risk of recurrence associated with discontinuation of antidepressants may be especially high in pregnant women with a lifetime history of several (eg, four) depressive episodes before pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This finding is consistent with observations in the general population of patients with major depression that with each recurrence of major depression, the risk of a subsequent episode increases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-course-of-illness#H856424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Course of illness&quot;, section on 'Recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>Many women who learn that they are pregnant while taking antidepressants decide to stop treatment during the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/59,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,62</a>]. Retrospective studies of health insurance databases have found that among women (total n &gt;25,000) who used antidepressants during the three to six months immediately preceding their pregnancy, 50 to 80 percent discontinued treatment during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/25,55,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,55,63,64</a>]. </p><p>For women who conceive while taking antidepressants but wish to discontinue them, a slow taper is preferred rather than abrupt discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>]. As an example, the drug can be tapered over one to two months by decreasing the dose approximately 25 percent every one to two weeks. This can diminish the risk of drug withdrawal symptoms and increase the probability of detecting incipient depressive symptoms before a full-blown depressive episode recurs.</p><p>If a woman becomes pregnant while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> and is stable, we suggest that she continue the medication, especially if response to paroxetine occurred after several other failed antidepressant trials. Although findings from multiple observational studies suggest that paroxetine may be associated with a small absolute risk of congenital cardiac defects, several other studies have found that paroxetine is not associated with cardiac defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. In addition, switching increases the risk of relapse and number of drug exposures. Nevertheless, patients may prefer to switch to another drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>), especially if paroxetine is the only drug they have used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3350047127\" class=\"local\">'Unipolar major depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild to moderate episodes of unipolar major depression are generally characterized by five or six depressive symptoms. Patients with mild to moderate illness do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning, are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgement that places the patient and others at risk for imminent harm. In addition, patients with severe depression can develop complications such as psychotic features, and often have a history of severe or recurrent depressive episodes. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H3732864867\" class=\"local\">'Severity of illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general principles and issues involved in treating unipolar major depression during pregnancy include setting, history of prior treatment, educating patients and families, adherence, monitoring symptoms, prescribing antidepressants, managing nonresponse, and making referrals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in pregnant women: General principles of treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women with severe unipolar major depression, we suggest antidepressant medications as initial treatment rather than psychotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, psychotherapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with a prior history of poor response to multiple antidepressants, or if patients decline pharmacotherapy after weighing the risks. Using psychotherapy is appropriate provided that the depressive syndrome does not include suicidal ideation or obvious impairment of function. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy typically receive psychotherapy as an adjuvant. (See <a href=\"#H87155478\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2096812256\" class=\"local\">'Weighing the risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant patients with severe unipolar major depression who were successfully treated with antidepressants prior to pregnancy should generally receive the same drug during pregnancy. For patients who have not been treated with antidepressants in the past, we suggest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as initial treatment, rather than other antidepressants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We typically select <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> if the patient has not previously used antidepressants; however, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> are reasonable alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H3807951204\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an antidepressant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many pregnant patients with unipolar major depression do not respond to initial treatment with an SSRI. For these treatment resistant patients, we suggest switching to a different SSRI, rather than other antidepressants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H87155490\" class=\"local\">'Treatment resistant patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe antenatal major depression who do not respond to multiple trials of SSRIs are generally switched to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>). (See <a href=\"#H87155576\" class=\"local\">'Treatment refractory patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe, antenatal unipolar major depression may not respond to sequential trials of SSRIs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H2752761921\" class=\"local\">'Other options'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many euthymic women are receiving maintenance pharmacotherapy for past episodes of unipolar major depression, have been stable for a substantial period of time, and are planning to conceive; these patients need to decide whether to continue treatment, based upon the risks of recurrence and maternal depression, as well as the risks of using antidepressants during pregnancy. Major depression is often recurrent, and we encourage patients with a moderate to severe lifetime course of illness to continue antidepressants during conception and the pregnancy, especially if previous attempts to discontinue treatment has caused recurrences. However, a reasonable option is to discontinue pharmacotherapy and to begin psychotherapy as maintenance treatment. If psychotherapy is successful as maintenance treatment for a period of time, patients can then attempt to conceive, and psychotherapy is continued during the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H494063\" class=\"local\">'Euthymic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We encourage women who are currently depressed, treated with an antidepressant, and planning to conceive to defer conception until they have remitted and remained stable for a sufficient period of time. (See <a href=\"#H494075\" class=\"local\">'Depressed patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who currently suffer unipolar major depression and are treated with pharmacotherapy may present with an unplanned pregnancy; we encourage these patients to continue their antidepressant, especially if the depressive episode has been severe. However, if the depressive syndrome has been mild to moderate and the patient feels strongly about avoiding further exposure, pharmacotherapy can be discontinued for the first trimester (during organogenesis), and subsequently restarted. In addition, it is reasonable to switch the patient from pharmacotherapy to psychotherapy, while monitoring for deterioration. However, discontinuing antidepressant medications may cause recurrence of depression.
