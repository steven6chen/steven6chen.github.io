Although not yet approved for clinical use in the United States, branched and fenestrated endovascular aortic devices have been developed to allow perfusion into specific aortic branches depending upon the level of repair (eg, renal artery, internal iliac artery). These advanced devices allow endovascular management of juxtarenal and potentially suprarenal aneurysms, and preservation of hypogastric flow when an adequate landing zone in the common iliac artery is not present.</p><p>The placement of aortic endovascular grafts is associated with device-related complications, which can include component disconnection, stent-graft buckling and migration over time. Secondary intervention is frequently needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. As such, these devices require lifelong surveillance; the long-term outcomes for these devices continue to be studied.</p><p>The specific devices available for endovascular repair of the abdominal aorta will be reviewed here. The indications for, placement of, and complications of these devices are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-endovascular-abdominal-aortic-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of endovascular abdominal aortic repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191837832\"><span class=\"h1\">AORTIC ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aorta is the major arterial conduit conveying blood from the heart to the systemic circulation. It originates immediately beyond the aortic valve ascending initially, then curving to form the aortic arch, and finally descending caudally adjacent the spine. The descending thoracic aorta continues through the hiatus of the diaphragm to become the abdominal aorta which extends into the retroperitoneum to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The abdominal aorta lies slightly left of the midline to accommodate the inferior vena cava which is in close apposition. The branches of the abdominal aorta (superior to inferior) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087 \">figure 1</a>) include the left and right inferior phrenic arteries, left and right middle suprarenal arteries, the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, left and right renal arteries in addition to occasional accessory renal arteries, left and right gonadal arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, the paired lumbar arteries (L1-L4) and middle sacral artery. The abdominal aorta bifurcates into the left and right common iliac arteries, which most often arise at the level of the 4<sup>th</sup> lumbar vertebra. The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet. The internal iliac artery has superior and inferior divisions that supply the pelvic viscera and muscles. The external iliac artery passes beneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191837912\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular aneurysm repair refers to the insertion of endovascular graft components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50772\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50772 \">figure 2</a>), usually via a femoral approach. The endovascular graft is constructed by the in vivo delivery and deployment of the device components in an established order determined by the specific anatomy of the patient. Upon deployment, the endograft expands, contacting the aortic wall proximally and aorta or iliac vessels distally, excluding the aneurysmal aortic wall from blood flow and pressure.</p><p>Although there are significant variations in endovascular graft design, three types of components are common to all: a delivery system, main body device, and device (limb) extensions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620227127\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The various endograft components are typically delivered through the femoral artery, either by direct surgical cut-down or percutaneously. If the femoral artery is too small to accommodate the delivery system, access can be obtained by suturing a synthetic graft of appropriate diameter (often 10 mm) to the common iliac artery to create an iliac conduit through a retroperitoneal incision. The size of the delivery system varies depending upon the device diameter required to provide proper endograft fixation. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620227120\"><span class=\"h2\">Main device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main body device for the abdominal aorta is usually bifurcated. Endovascular grafts rely primarily upon outward tension in the proximal graft to maintain the positioning of the graft. Fixation systems may also include barbs or a suprarenal uncovered extension. Bifurcated abdominal aortic grafts require adjunctive placement of iliac artery limbs to complete the graft. The iliac limbs on the main body device vary in length depending upon whether the graft is a two- or three-component graft. Two-component grafts have one short and one long iliac limb. Three-component devices have two short limbs. </p><p>Endovascular grafts for the abdominal aorta are generally bifurcated; however, some situations require the use of a unibody (ie, not bifurcated) graft, also known as an aorta-uni-iliac (AUI) device. These grafts are used in patients with severe unilateral iliac artery stenosis or occlusion. AUI devices can also be used for the treatment of some ruptured aneurysms. A bifurcated-to-unilateral graft conversion kit can be used in the situation when contralateral iliac artery access or contralateral gate cannulation is difficult or impossible. This kit effectively turns a bifurcated main body graft into a unilateral graft by covering one of the iliac limbs proximally. After deployment of an AUI device, a plug may be inserted into the contralateral iliac artery to prevent retrograde flow of blood into the aneurysm sac, if needed. The contralateral extremity typically requires a femoro-femoral crossover bypass for perfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H441029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Choice of graft'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H2369876151\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Endograft placement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620227113\"><span class=\"h2\">Extensions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One or more extension devices may be needed to provide a complete proximal or distal seal. Following the deployment of the main device and any necessary contralateral limbs or extensions, an aortogram is performed to assure that the endograft has completely excluded the aneurysm from the circulation. The term &quot;endoleak&quot; was coined to describe the persistence of blood flow into the aneurysm. If additional ballooning of the device does not firmly appose the graft to the aortic wall and eliminate a type I endoleak, placement of additional proximal aortic or iliac extensions may be needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191828485\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal endovascular devices are increasingly being used as a minimally-invasive alternative to open surgical repair of the aorta. The main indication for these devices is treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Endovascular repair of the abdominal aorta has also been used to treat isolated infrarenal aortic dissection, traumatic aortic injuries, and aortic atheroembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Endovascular grafts for the abdominal aorta are generally modular, bifurcated devices; however, an aorta-uni-iliac (AUI) device or bifurcated-to-unilateral graft conversion kit may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H620227120\" class=\"local\">'Main device'</a> above.)</p><p>Controlled comparisons of abdominal aortic stent-grafts have not been performed. Devices available to treat the abdominal aorta include the Zenith, Excluder, AFX and Powerlink, Endurant, Aorfix, Ovation, and Incraft grafts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>). A number of investigational devices are in early clinical testing phases. The essential features of the grafts approved for use in the United States and clinical data supporting them are discussed below. The features of these grafts are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191829332\"><span class=\"h2\">Zenith</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Zenith abdominal endograft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>) is a bifurcated, modular, three-component system. It is composed of woven polyester (ie, Dacron) sutured to stainless steel Gianturco Z-stents, with a bare suprarenal stent for active fixation of the proximal graft. </p><p>The main body is available in diameters that range from 22 to 36 mm and lengths that range from 82 to 149 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The iliac limbs are available in 8 and 24 mm diameters in lengths ranging from 3.7 to 12.4 cm. The delivery sheath for bifurcated grafts is between 18 and 20 French (6.0 to 7.67 mm) depending upon the size of the graft, and the sheaths for other components range from 14 to 16 French (3.67 to 5.33 mm). </p><p>The safety and efficacy of the Zenith abdominal endograft was evaluated in a comparison study involving 352 patients in four study groups: an open surgical control group, a standard-risk (SR) group, a high-risk group, and a roll-in group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Eighty control patients were enrolled with the intent of comparing them with the standard repair endovascular group. The technical success rate for endovascular repair was 99.7 percent. Perioperative (30-day) morbidity (cardiac, pulmonary, renal) was significantly decreased compared with the control group. Endovascular repair was also associated with fewer transfusion requirements, diminished blood loss, shorter length of hospital and intensive care unit stay, and quicker return to daily activities. Perioperative (30-day) mortality was significantly lower in the endovascular repair group (0.5 versus 2.5 percent) compared with the open surgical group. At one year of follow-up, all-cause mortality was not significantly different between the groups (3.5 percent in the standard risk endovascular repair group versus 3.8 percent in the control group). There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality or aneurysm-related death between the standard risk endovascular group and the control group on Kaplan-Meier analysis. </p><p>There were no immediate conversions reported, but three late conversions were performed: one for endoleak, one for a rapidly expanding supraceliac pseudoaneurysm, and one for rupture at 222 days postoperatively. The need for reintervention was significantly higher (11 versus 2.5 percent) for the standard risk endograft group compared with the control group at one year follow-up. The incidence of endoleak (mostly Type II) was 7.4 percent at 12 months and 5.4 percent at 24 months. Migration was not seen in any patient after 12 months. At two years follow-up, the majority of the aneurysms demonstrated shrinkage of the aneurysm sac. In a retrospective review evaluating outcomes of 282 patients over an average of 40 months, aneurysm related mortality was 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among those who required reintervention, 82 percent were performed within the first four years of endovascular repair; no new complications were treated after six years follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191829339\"><span class=\"h2\">Excluder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Excluder device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>) is a self-expanding modular bifurcated two-component graft made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) material bonded to a nitinol exoskeleton and covered with a reinforcing sleeve of <span class=\"nowrap\">ePTFE/fluorinated</span> ethylene propylene (FEP) composite film. The proximal graft and ipsilateral limb have scalloped flares lined with graft material. The proximal graft and distal limbs have an ePTFE sealing cuff to improve apposition to the arterial wall.</p><p>The main body graft is available in diameters ranging from 23 to 31 mm with an ipsilateral limb measuring 12 or 14.5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The length of the body of the graft ranges from 12 to 18 cm. The contralateral limb is available in diameters ranging from 12 to 20 mm and lengths from 9.5 to 13.5 cm. The main device is delivered in an 18 or 20 French (6 to 6.67 mm) sheath. The device employs a unique delivery system that relies upon a pull-cord similar to a dog food bag. Once the device is positioned, the deployment line unlaces from the middle of the device toward both ends. </p><p>The safety and efficacy of the Excluder graft was evaluated in a prospective nonrandomized trial that enrolled 334 patients (235 endovascular and 99 open surgical control patients) in 19 different centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Compared with the control group, the Excluder group had less blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, and decreased length of recovery. At one-year and two-year follow-up, the Excluder group had a significantly lower incidence of major complications (33 versus 67 percent). There were no significant differences between the groups in survival rate at two-year follow-up. In the Excluder group, the incidence of aneurysm-related death was 2.6 percent, but there were no late aneurysm ruptures at four-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Aneurysm sac enlargement, defined as &ge;5 mm change from baseline size, occurred in 3 and 36 percent of patients at one and five years, respectively, after graft placement in the Excluder 98-03 Pivotal Trial, the majority occurring without any apparent endoleaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This phenomenon led the company to release an updated version of the Excluder device in July 2004. The new device incorporated the additional low-permeability layer (FEP) to reduce exudation of fluid flow across the graft material. Following these improvements, minimal aneurysm sac expansion and significant aneurysm sac regression have been found after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms using the new Excluder device at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and with longer follow-up at five and ten years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In one study of 179 patients, the estimated 10-year rate of aneurysm-related death or rupture was 2.1 percent (old and new designs included). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191829346\"><span class=\"h2\">AFX and Powerlink</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AFX and IntuiTrak Powerlink systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>) are modular bifurcated grafts composed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) supported by a self-expanding internal cobalt-chromium alloy skeleton. The main body of the endograft has symmetric iliac limbs. The proximal graft has a bare stent for active fixation and the bifurcation of the graft rests on the aortic bifurcation for anatomic distal fixation. The AFX graft has replaced the initial Powerlink graft design, and is distinguished by a lower profile and a multilayered STRATA ePTFE graft material that is intended to provide greater strength and better conformability. </p><p>The main device is available in diameters ranging from 22 to 28 mm in lengths ranging from 6 to 10 cm with limbs measuring 13 or 16 mm in diameter and lengths from 3 to 5.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The limb extensions range from 16 to 20 mm in diameter in lengths from 5.5 to 8.8 cm. The main device is delivered in a 21 French (7 mm) sheath and the contralateral limb is delivered through a 17 or 19 French (5.67, 6.33 mm) sheath. </p><p>The safety and efficacy of the Powerlink graft was evaluated in a multicenter, nonrandomized comparison study conducted at 15 sites that enrolled 192 patients who received the graft and 66 open surgical patients between 2000 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Technical success was achieved in 97.9 percent of patients. Patients treated with the Powerlink stent-graft had significantly decreased blood loss (341 versus 1582 mL), operative time (133 versus 222 minutes), length of intensive care unit stay (0.78 versus 4.1 days) and hospital stay (3.3 versus 9.5 days) compared with the open control group. There were no significant differences in mortality rates. There were no reported graft-related endoleaks (Type I, III, or IV) at four years of follow-up, and also no reports of ruptures, graft fabric defects, or wire fractures. Aneurysm sac regression was noted in 83 percent of patients. The six-year follow-up results also reported no stent fractures, graft disruptions, or aneurysm ruptures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. No differences in all-cause morbidity were found between the Powerlink and open surgical groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191829362\"><span class=\"h2\">Endurant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Endurant endograft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>) is a modular, bifurcated device composed of a multifilament polyester fabric with an external self-expanding support structure of M-shaped electro-polished nitinol stents. Proximally, it has a suprarenal nitinol stent with anchoring pins for suprarenal fixation. The graft design is intended to treat aneurysms with more challenging anatomy (eg, neck angulation).</p><p>The main device is available in diameters that range from 23 to 36 mm for the main body and 13 to 20 mm for the ipsilateral limb, and in lengths of 12.4, 14.5 and 16.6 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The contralateral iliac stent component ranges from 10 to 28 mm in diameter with 8.2, 9.3 and 12.4 cm lengths. The internal diameter of the delivery sheath for the bifurcated grafts is 18 or 20 French (6.0, 6.67 mm) and the sheaths for other components range from 14 to 16 French (4.67 to 5.33 mm). </p><p>A single arm, multicenter trial evaluating the safety and performance of the Endurant graft was conducted at 26 sites in the United States and enrolled 150 patients between April 2008 and May 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The technical success rate was 99.3 percent. One failure was due to inability to cannulate the contralateral gate and one patient ruptured during the procedure, but was still treated successfully. The perioperative mortality (30-day) rate was zero and the incidence of major adverse events was 4 percent. At one-year follow-up there were no migrations, ruptures, open conversions or graft-related endoleaks (type I or III). Ten aneurysm-related re-interventions were performed during the first year of follow-up, mostly for graft limb thrombosis or stenosis (five) or type II endoleak (two). Aneurysm sac diameter decreased &gt;5 mm at one year in 47 percent of patients and remained stable in 53 percent. No instances of sac growth were reported. Late deaths occurred in 4.7 percent of patients but were not related to the aneurysm repair. The ENGAGE registry, which has enrolled 1262 patients from 2009 to 2011 at 39 sites around the world, has reported similar outcomes at 30 days (all patients) and at one year for 500 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A European trial enrolled 80 patients between November 2007 and August 2008, 71 of whom had moderate infrarenal aortic neck angulation and nine with a high degree of angulation (60&deg; to 75&deg;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The device was successfully delivered and deployed in all cases. At one-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was 5 percent, with potentially one device-related death. Serious adverse events were comparable between the high and moderate angulation groups. There were no device migrations, stent fractures, aortic ruptures, or conversions to open repair. Maximal aneurysm diameter decreased &gt;5 mm in 43 percent of cases. Three secondary endovascular procedures were performed for outflow vessel stenosis, graft limb occlusion, and iliac extension, resulting in a secondary patency rate of 100 percent. No re-interventions were required in the high angulation group. </p><p>Five-year outcomes of the Endurant stent graft regulatory trial in the United States demonstrate that this device appears to be durable with limited adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates, freedom from AAA-related mortality was 99.2 percent; all-cause mortality was 18 percent. There were no endograft migrations, fractures, or conversions to open repair. Endoleaks were identified in <span class=\"nowrap\">7/83</span> patients (8.4 percent) and included type II endoleaks (6), and one endoleak of indeterminate origin. Maximum AAA diameter increased by 5 mm in <span class=\"nowrap\">5/83</span> (6 percent) patients. Eighteen secondary interventions were required in 15 patients (11 percent): 12 for endoleak, 4 for limb occlusion, 1 for stenosis and 1 for thromboembolism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3370244521\"><span class=\"h2\">Aorfix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Aorfix AAA endograft is a bifurcated woven polyester graft supported by a nitinol skeleton. Active fixation is provided by proximal nitinol hooks. The graft is intended to treat angulated aortic necks for up to 90 degrees and tortuous iliac anatomy. The proximal portion of the main graft body is fish-mouthed (rather than circular) in shape, and when positioned properly, the surface area of the potentially achievable seal-zone is increased in the anterior-to-posterior dimension. Because of this feature, the distance from the superior mesenteric artery to the lowest renal artery needs to be at least 15 mm in length to prevent inadvertent coverage of the superior mesenteric artery orifice during graft deployment. The Aorfix graft is currently approved for clinical use and available in Europe, and is awaiting approval in the United States. Short-term and mid-term data from European trials have confirmed the safety of the device and its suitability for treating hostile aorto-iliac anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The PYTHAGORAS trial is currently recruiting participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2274127089\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Ovation endograft system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>) is an ultra-low profile (14-French [Fr, 4.7 mm]) system. The main body is a modular, two docking-limb device with active suprarenal fixation and polymer-filled proximal fixation rings. Short-term outcomes show that the device is safe and effective for treating patients with infrarenal AAA, particularly among those with challenging anatomy including short aortic necks and narrow iliac vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/27-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-34</a>]. Longer-term follow-up is needed and studies are ongoing. </p><p>A multicenter trial was conducted at 36 sites in the United States, Germany, and Chile between 2009 and 2011 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device for treating intrarenal AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. One hundred sixty-one patients were enrolled, with a mean AAA diameter of 54&plusmn;9 mm. The main inclusion criteria included a proximal aortic neck length of &ge;7 mm, inner aortic neck diameter of 16 to 30 mm, distal iliac landing zone length of &ge;10 mm, and iliac diameter of 8 to 20 mm. Clinical follow-up was planned for discharge, 30 days, six months, and annually through five years. The results through one year are summarized. </p><p>The technical success rate for stent-graft placement was 100 percent; 43 percent were able to be placed using percutaneous techniques (ie, no cut-down). The perioperative (30-day) major morbidity and mortality rate was 2.5 percent. At one year, rates for AAA-related and all-cause mortality were 0.6 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.

Endovascular aortic repair requires that specific anatomic criteria be fulfilled, and for those with appropriate anatomy, this technique has become a preferred approach and allows the treatment of patients who might not otherwise be candidates for aortic repair. (See <a href=\"#H1191828461\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endovascular aortic repair involves the insertion of endovascular graft components, usually via a femoral approach. The endovascular graft is constructed in vivo by the delivery and deployment of these components in an established order. Upon deployment, the endograft expands, contacting the aortic wall proximally and aorta or iliac vessels distally to exclude the native, dilated portion of the aortic wall from aortic blood flow and pressure. (See <a href=\"#H1191837912\" class=\"local\">'Basic principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are significant variations in endovascular graft design, three types of components are common to all: the delivery system, main body device, and device extensions. Devices that are commercially available in the United States to treat the abdominal aorta include the Zenith, Excluder, AFX and Powerlink, Endurant, Aorfix, and Ovation grafts. The characteristics for each graft are described above. (See <a href=\"#H1191828485\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal devices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When aortic disease is more extensive and involves branch vessels, the complexity of the repair and risk of complications increases. Approaches to manage more complicated anatomy include debranching procedures and the use of fenestrated and branched endografts. These endografts preserve blood flow into specific aortic branches depending upon the level of repair, but are available only for investigational use in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H1191837723\" class=\"local\">'Advanced devices'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several trials have compared endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair using a variety of endografts for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. These trials have consistently demonstrated significantly reduced perioperative (30-day) morbidity and mortality (1 to 2 versus 3 to 5 percent) for endovascular compared with open surgical repair; however, long-term mortality is not significantly different. Secondary intervention is frequently needed in patients who receive an abdominal endograft. As such, these devices require lifelong surveillance; the long-term outcomes for these devices continue to be studied.
