Structural imaging modalities provide spatial resolution based primarily upon anatomic or morphologic data. Functional imaging modalities provide spatial resolution based upon physiologic or metabolic data. Some techniques provide both structural and functional information.</p><p>The major imaging modalities for structural and functional evaluation of the developing central nervous system (CNS) are ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Ultrasonography and CT provide rapid screening for gross macrostructural abnormalities. Nuclear medicine techniques may offer additional functional data. MRI in current clinical use and advanced MR techniques often provide the most definitive macrostructural, microstructural, and functional imaging information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASONOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The resolving power of ultrasonography (US) is based upon variations in acoustic reflectance of tissues. This technique has many advantages. It is readily accessible, portable, and fast; images are viewed in real time and are multiplanar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. It is less expensive than other cross sectional modalities and is considered relatively noninvasive because it does not involve ionizing radiation. Furthermore, US requires no contrast agent, and patient sedation rarely is needed.</p><p>However, US also has certain limitations. The diagnostic effectiveness of US depends primarily upon the skill and experience of the operator and interpreter. In addition, US requires a window or path for cranial and spinal imaging that is unimpeded by bone or air. Thus, US can be used for neuroimaging in the fetus during a prenatal examination and in the infant who has an open fontanelle and sutures. US also can be used to examine the immature or dysplastic cranium or spine (eg, dysraphism), the orbit, and the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical US is generally considered safe. However, concerns have been raised regarding the use of ultrasonography for nonmedical imaging of the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These concerns include the deposition of radio-frequency from the current generation of machines with 3D and 4D capabilities. As with radiation, the principle of &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; (ALARA) should be followed during ultrasonography to maintain the lowest possible exposure to mechanical and thermal indices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound applications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important applications of US in the neuroimaging of children are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal and neonatal screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53684\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53684 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bedside examination of a critically ill infant who is too unstable to be examined in the radiology department (eg, infant requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid provision of important adjunctive information using Doppler (eg, determination whether a mass is cystic, solid, or vascular), differentiation of subarachnoid collections (eg, benign external hydrocephalus) from subdural collections (eg, chronic subdural hematoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], assessment of vascularity, vascular flow, increased intracranial pressure, or edema (eg, measuring resistive index) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81194\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81194 \">image 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Real-time guidance and monitoring during diagnostic or therapeutic interventional neuroradiologic procedures (eg, transcatheter endovascular ablation of vein of Galen vascular malformation) and surgical procedures (eg, craniotomy and laminectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in US technology include the development of high-resolution transducers, improvements in color Doppler signal processing, and new scanning techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>].

A variety of microbubble-based preparations are being tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Potential applications include the detection of slow blood flow and the assessment of organ perfusion. In addition, if TCD is performed at the same time as bubble echocardiography, the visualization of bubbles in the intracranial circulation indicates significant right-to-left shunting with potential for cerebral thromboembolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Improvements in computerized analysis of textural features of the CNS will provide increased sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PLAIN RADIOGRAPHS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film radiography has little utility in imaging the pediatric central nervous system.

The data are digitized and converted to cross-sectional images with the help of powerful array processors. These devices record, digitize, store, and tomographically reconstruct hundreds of projection images acquired at many angles about the patient, using special mathematical algorithms. High-resolution bone and soft tissue algorithms are needed to demonstrate fine anatomy (eg, the base of the skull). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although CT uses ionizing radiation, current-generation scanners effectively collimate and restrict the exposure to the immediate volume of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Direct imaging usually is restricted to the axial or coronal plane. Reformatting from thin axial sections to other planes (eg, coronal or sagittal) also limits the radiation exposure.</p><p>Projection scout images may provide information similar to plain radiographs but with less spatial resolution. CT scanning of the pediatric central nervous system is performed using either the conventional noncontinuous or the continuous <span class=\"nowrap\">helical/spiral</span> technique; the latter includes the more advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">multidetector/multislice</span> technology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When clinically indicated, CT is considered a relatively safe procedure in children with proper application of radiation protection, appropriate use of nonionic contrast agents, proper administration of sedation or anesthesia when needed, and monitoring of vital signs.</p><p>Relative contraindications to CT in children are unusual but include certain syndromes in which radiation could induce chromosome breaks and increase the genetic predisposition to tumors (eg, ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/1-3,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,15-18</a>]. However, such studies should not be withheld if they are required to provide optimal management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ataxia-telangiectasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ataxia-telangiectasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nijmegen-breakage-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nijmegen breakage syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation dose is particularly important in children because radiation exposure from CT scanning appears to be associated with a small increased lifetime cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In addition, there is a suggestion in the literature that early radiation to the brain may impair long-term cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Although pediatric CT accounts for approximately 15 percent of radiographic examinations, it contributes to an estimated 70 percent of the total radiation dose to the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Most studies of CT have been performed in adults; the same doses of radiation that have been studied in adults are typically used in children. Many CT units have software that automatically chooses tube current based upon optimal image quality calculated for adults.</p><p>Every effort must be made to minimize the radiation dose to children from CT examinations. The policy of &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; (ALARA), or &quot;least radiation dose necessary&quot; to produce a diagnostic scan should always be followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In addition, there was no increase in the number of repeat studies related to poor technical quality.</p><p>The Image Gently campaign (<a href=\"http://www.imagegently.org/&amp;token=McmUHzbivMBbVmUkgiAMB678TmVVVFIsyo/J1puFR+NfPQPaEuVR9OABRV1sK+YQ&amp;TOPIC_ID=6156\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.imagegently.org</a>) offers information for practitioners, radiology technicians, and parents regarding opportunities to use lower radiation doses in the imaging of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedation is rarely required for CT examinations in children because most CT examinations take only seconds or minutes to perform, particularly when ultrafast <span class=\"nowrap\">helical/spiral</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">multidetector/multislice</span> technology is used. High-resolution studies that require immobilization to avoid motion artifact (eg, temporal bone examination) are the exception. A newborn or young infant often can be examined during sleep (eg, after a feeding or at the usual nap-time).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">CT applications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of CT in pediatric neuroimaging has been redefined in the context of accessible and reliable ultrasonography and MRI. Ultrasonography is the procedure of choice for primary imaging or screening of the CNS in the newborn and young infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but has its limitations. When ultrasonography does not satisfy the clinical inquiry, or an acoustic window is not available, CT is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>In other situations, MRI is the preferred imaging technique. However, MRI may not be readily available or feasible. CT is used in these situations, although it is less desirable. Because CT can be performed quickly and safely, imaging should never be delayed for a child with a suspected space-occupying intracranial lesion in order to obtain an MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Typically, an unenhanced brain scan should be performed before a contrast-enhanced scan in patients without a history of atopy or allergy to iodine. In patients with brain abscess, post-contrast only examinations can be used for follow-up.<br/><br/>Vascular-enhanced CT may help in the evaluation of a mass or hemorrhage of unknown etiology and identify the membrane of a chronic subdural collection (eg, child abuse). By identifying the cortical veins, enhanced CT may distinguish prominent low-density subarachnoid collections (eg, benign extracerebral collections or benign external hydrocephalus of infancy) from low-density subdural collections (eg, chronic subdural hematomas or hygromas).

The MRI signal is derived from multiple parameters, including T1, T2, proton density, T2*, proton flow, proton relaxation enhancement, chemical shift, and molecular diffusion. This contrasts with ultrasonography and CT, in which the signal is essentially uniparametric (ie, acoustic reflectance and x-ray attenuation, respectively). MRI also uses many more basic imaging techniques than these other modalities (eg, spin echo, inversion recovery, gradient echo, echo planar, and chemical shift imaging methods). MRI provides multiplanar imaging with equivalent resolution in all planes without repositioning the patient. Bone does not interfere with soft tissue resolution, although metallic objects often produce signal void or field distortion artifacts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRI often provides more sensitive and specific imaging information about pediatric CNS abnormalities than ultrasonography or CT.

However, there is increasing awareness of stroke in children. The etiologies of neonatal and childhood stroke are different from those of adult stroke, since atherosclerosis is usually not a factor in childhood stroke. Common risk factors for ischemic stroke in children include congenital and acquired cardiac lesions, vascular lesions, hematologic abnormalities, infection, and genetic conditions. Sickle cell disease is the most common cause of stroke in children. Abnormalities of the cerebral vasculature that predispose to arterial ischemic stroke include arterial dissection, focal (or transient) cerebral arteriopathy of childhood, fibromuscular dysplasia, moyamoya syndrome, and vasculitis.

MRI has proven particularly useful in the examination of midline brain structures such as the corpus callosum, posterior fossa structures, and the dependent lateral ventricle.

DWI detects the intracellular changes that may result from tissue injury by measuring the rate of diffusion, or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The ADC is higher for free or pure water than for macromolecular-bound water and varies according to the microstructural or physiologic state of a tissue. Clinical applications of DWI include the evaluation of ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76709\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76709 \">image 7</a>), metabolic disorders, assessment of brain maturation, and characterizations of tumors. The diffusion of water decreases within minutes after an ischemic insult and falls progressively during the first hour. Bright signal is demonstrated with DWI at a time when conventional imaging is negative. The early signal is thought to reflect cytotoxic edema. In acute ischemia, ADC values remain decreased or restricted for a period of up to 10 days. In addition, certain tumors, including posterior fossa medulloblastoma, produce a restricted pattern of diffusion abnormality, probably as a result of the high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a refinement of the DWI technique. DTI provides microstructural mapping of normal and injured white matter tracts based upon fractional anisotropic changes (ie, differences related to orientation and development of white matter fibers). Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a measure of the restriction of motion of water in the brain normally constrained by axonal myelination. There is a known pattern of increasing FA in conjunction with decreasing ADC during premyelination and myelination of the normal infant brain. In addition to the quantitative parameters that can be calculated with DTI, tractography can be performed. Tractography connects the fibers with similar FA values to develop a 3D image of the fiber tracts. Certain metabolic disorders are associated with abnormal shifts of water and decreased diffusion; these changes can be detected with DTI, which may provide a means of tracking disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. DTI has a variety of applications in mapping the course, extent, and connectivity patterns of white matter structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These may include surgical planning for patients with arteriovenous malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>] and defining anatomy in patients with central nervous system anomalies or injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) is based on the principle of dye dilution and can be used to evaluate cerebral perfusion through the application of a dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted MRI technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. Arterial spin tag labeling (ASL) techniques also have been developed; ASL utilizes the signal change from water endogenous to arterial blood as it flows from the neck to the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. PWI offers a qualitative and quantitative assessment of normal and abnormal cerebrovascular dynamics, including relative cerebral blood volume, relative cerebral blood flow, mean transit time, and time to peak arrival of contrast. These measurements are complementary to conventional MRI. Applications of PWI include evaluation of ischemic cerebrovascular disease (eg, hypoxia-ischemia, moyamoya, sickle cell disease), differentiation of tumor progression from treatment effects, and brain activation imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional MRI (fMRI) is an advanced application of PWI that is used to localize brain activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. fMRI displays local or regional changes in cerebral blood flow that accompany the stimulation or activation of somatosensory, special sensory (eg, visual, auditory), motor, or cognitive centers. fMRI can provide important information regarding cognitive and behavioral disorders.

It provides quantitative information about cellular metabolites because signal intensity is directly related to the metabolite concentration. Cellular metabolites of interest include N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), which is a marker of axons and neurons; creatine, which is a measure of high energy phosphate products, such as ATP and ADP; and choline, which is a marker of cell membrane turnover. Efficiently obtaining single and multiple spectroscopic samples is possible using the high inherent sensitivity of hydrogen-1 to detect low concentration metabolites in healthy and diseased tissues. MRS may detect biochemical changes before morphological changes are apparent and, thus, provide insight into the follow-up assessment and prognosis of a variety of CNS processes.<br/><br/>MRS is used primarily in the assessment of brain development and maturation, perinatal brain injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67971\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67971 \">waveform 1</a>), childhood central nervous system neoplasia and treatment effects, and metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. As an example of the application of MRS, in the presence of a high grade malignant tumor such as a posterior fossa medulloblastoma or WHO grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme, NAA will be nearly completely absent owing to the destruction of normal underlying brain parenchyma, whereas choline will be markedly elevated owing to the increase in cell membrane turnover.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) suppresses background tissues and increases resolution for vascular flow enhancement (eg, MRA) and gadolinium enhancement (eg, to demonstrate tumor seeding).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher field strength 3Tesla magnets (3T) are an important advance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Tumor types that take up 99mTc-MIBI include brainstem glioma, fibrillary astrocytoma, other low-grade astrocytomas, and glioblastoma multiforme. 99mTc-MIBI scans demonstrate changes in these tumors over time and correlate with histologic grade. In contrast, tumors demonstrated on MRI that are <strong>not</strong> visualized on 99mTc-MIBI SPECT include craniopharyngioma, medulloblastoma, and optic glioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS lymphoma &mdash; Thallium 201 (201-TI SPECT) is useful for the diagnosis of head and neck lymphoma.

Ideally, both ictal and interictal SPECT should be obtained to localize the seizure focus; subtraction examinations can be performed off-line once the images are processed. Because cerebral blood flow changes are extremely rapid during the ictal phase, ictal injections should be performed within the first five to 10 seconds of seizure onset to obtain accurate localization. Timely injections during the ictal phase remain the main limitation of SPECT in children with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].<br/><br/>Ictal SPECT scans can be used to localize the epileptic focus in patients with epilepsy. Focal increased perfusion via SPECT occurs in up to 90 percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Ictal patterns vary, but the most common pattern is unilateral temporal hyperperfusion with relatively decreased perfusion in other cortical areas in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere. SPECT localization of epileptic focus has been reported in 70 to 90 percent of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy. Ictal SPECT studies also are useful in studying seizure spread. In temporal lobe epilepsy, ipsilateral basal ganglia hyperperfusion may be seen. In extra-temporal lobe epilepsy, the pattern of spread is more complex. In mesial frontal seizures, for example, the areas of activation often involve ipsilateral or bilateral basal ganglia and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">PET scans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In positron emission tomography (PET), the detection and tomographic imaging of dual-photon positron emitting radionuclides serves as a functional imaging modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. PET neuroimaging is based on the assumption that areas of high radioactive uptake are associated with brain activity. The flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is generally believed to be correlated with brain activity, is measured using radioactive tracers, such as 15-oxygen (15-O), 18-fluorothymidine (18-F) or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). For practical reasons, FDG is the preferred tracer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">PET applications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PET imaging may be useful for the evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, lymphoma, epilepsy, encephalitis, and other pediatric disorders affecting the CNS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS tumors &mdash; In children, PET and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> (which permits more accurate anatomic localization with sequential imaging on the same machine) are increasingly used in the diagnosis of CNS pathology and head and neck tumors.

FDG-PET with MRI coregistration and image fusion on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanners results in better tumor localization and differentiation between benign and malignant pathology. The degree of FDG uptake in CNS tumors correlates with World Health Organization malignancy grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Even with this correlation between tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">hotspot/brain</span> index and mitotic activity, there remains considerable overlap between high-grade and low-grade pediatric tumors. In addition, certain benign tumors are known to have high FDG uptake. These include pilocytic astrocytoma, choroid plexus papilloma, and the pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. The use of new PET tracers in CNS tumors, including radiolabeled amino acids, 11-C-choline and 18-F-choline, appear promising in differentiating benign from malignant neoplasms. Tumor proliferation imaging with radiolabeled nucleoside analogs to assess DNA synthesis also holds promise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoma &mdash; The role of PET in childhood lymphoma is undergoing evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children/abstract/96,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,99</a>].

The majority of PET studies in children are obtained between seizures, largely because of the practical difficulties inherent with ictal studies. When PET is concordant with the results of electroencephalography, it is superior to CT or MRI alone. Although MRI is highly sensitive in detecting seizure foci and other lesions in temporal lobe surgical candidates, PET may be indicated when the MRI is normal. FDG-PET parallels the results of MR spectroscopy in epileptic foci and non-epileptic foci throughout the brain.
