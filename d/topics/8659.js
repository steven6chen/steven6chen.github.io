Symptoms do not typically occur unless the aneurysm is large and are primarily related to compression of surrounding structures. Like abdominal aortic aneurysms, IAAs have a propensity for life-threatening rupture as diameter increases. On occasion, aneurysm thrombosis may lead to peripheral thromboembolism or acute limb ischemia. </p><p>The management of asymptomatic IAAs depends upon the size of the aneurysm, the presence or absence of coexisting abdominal aortic aneurysm or other aneurysm (eg, femoral, popliteal), and patient comorbidities. Patients with symptomatic IAAs should be referred for prompt vascular evaluation and repair.</p><p>The diagnosis and management of IAAs will be reviewed here. The surgical and endovascular management of IAAs is reviewed elsewhere.

Approximately two-thirds of patients with IAA have involvement of more than one segment of the iliac arterial tree; one-third of IAAs are bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The common iliac arteries are the terminal branches of the abdominal aorta and arise at the level of the 4<sup>th</sup> lumbar vertebra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087 \">figure 1</a>). The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet. The internal iliac artery gives off branches to the pelvic viscera and also supplies the musculature of the pelvis. The external iliac artery passes beneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20024768\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of iliac aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any vessel, a true IAA is defined as a focal dilation of the artery with a diameter that is increased more than 50 percent compared with the normal diameter of the artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In men, the common iliac artery normally averages 1.2&plusmn;0.2 cm, whereas in women it is smaller, averaging 1.0&plusmn;0.2 cm. The internal iliac artery in both genders averages 0.54&plusmn;0.15 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Based upon these values, for the common iliac artery, an aneurysm is generally present if the artery measures &gt;1.85 cm in males and &gt;1.5 cm in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An internal iliac artery with a diameter more than 0.8 cm is likely aneurysmal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107323044\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solitary iliac artery aneurysms (IAAs) are uncommon. The overall incidence of solitary IAA in the general population is estimated to be approximately 0.03 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Solitary IAA represents approximately 0.4 to 1.9 percent of all cases of aneurysmal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Isolated iliac artery aneurysms are very rare in the pediatric population and are usually related to connective tissue disorders or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The incidence of IAA associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is higher. Given an incidence of AAA of approximately 5 percent based upon screening studies, and that approximately 25 percent of patients with AAA have an IAA, the incidence of IAA associated with AAA in the general population is approximately 1 percent. </p><p>Risk factors for degenerative IAA are the similar risk factors for other degenerative large vessel aneurysms (abdominal aortic aneurysm, popliteal aneurysm) and include male gender, white race, advancing age, history of smoking, hypertension and other risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H1382371318\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>In a retrospective study evaluating surgical treatment for isolated IAA in 56 patients, 96 percent of the patients were men, 60 percent had a significant smoking history, 79 percent had hypertension, 50 percent had coronary artery disease, and 27 percent of patients had prior AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>In a large retrospective review examining 715 common IAAs, 94 percent of patients were men, the mean age was 72 years, and 69 percent of patients had hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this series, hypertension predicted faster iliac artery expansion compared with normotensive patients (0.32 versus 0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20024782\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of IAAs are true aneurysms that are the result of arterial wall degeneration. Less commonly, a pseudoaneurysm is the cause of iliac artery dilation and can be due to para-anastomotic graft failure following a prior aortic graft repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], vascular injury from penetrating mechanisms (gunshot, knife), or iatrogenic injury during hip replacement, lumbar disc surgery or other pelvic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>IAAs have also been associated with Behcet&rsquo;s syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], fibromuscular dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], Takayasu&rsquo;s arteritis and other connective tissue disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In rare cases, infected aneurysm can develop in the iliac arteries and organisms including Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella and Candida have been isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>].

The etiology of this imbalance is multifactorial and likely a complex interplay of inflammatory, immunologic and potentially mechanical and genetic factors. A common systemic etiology for large vessel aneurysm formation is supported by the occurrence of multiple large vessel aneurysms in the same patient. The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H431203144\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm diameter and rupture risk'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20026251\"><span class=\"h2\">Iliac artery expansion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of isolated IAAs and those in association with an AAA is continued expansion over time with the observed rate of expansion related to iliac artery diameter on initial diagnosis. Data for the expansion of IAA come mostly from studies evaluating the much more prevalent common iliac artery aneurysm. There are few studies relating to the natural history of internal and external IAAs to help guide their management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H721247733\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated iliac artery aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a retrospective review evaluating aneurysm growth rates, isolated IAAs &lt;3 cm in diameter expanded at an average rate of 1.1 mm per year, whereas aneurysms &gt;3 cm expanded by 2.6 mm per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20025038\"><span class=\"h3\">Iliac artery aneurysms with coexistent abdominal aortic aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IAA is frequently associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72488\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72488 \">image 1</a>). Between 15 to 40 percent of patients who present with abdominal aortic aneurysm have at least one IAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11,20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20-25</a>]. In a retrospective review of 439 patients with 715 common IAAs, 86 percent had an abdominal aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Iliac aneurysm was bilateral in 70 percent of those who had an associated AAA. </p><p>In a review of 190 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), surveillance found that 41 percent of the patients had a concomitant common IAA defined by a diameter &gt;16 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In this study, a regression model was developed to determine iliac artery growth rates. Iliac artery expansion depended upon baseline iliac diameter. A common iliac artery measuring 16 mm could be expected to expand to 25 mm within 10 years, and a 23 mm common iliac artery would reach 35 mm. Expansion of an IAA was more likely in patients who had AAA that also expanded. No correlation was found between AAA growth rate and CIA growth rate, or AAA diameter and CIA growth rate. The authors concluded the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common iliac artery measuring &lt;16 mm when diagnosed and associated with AAA &lt;4 cm could reasonably be reevaluated when intervention for the AAA is planned because of the slower growth rates</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common iliac artery measuring of &gt;16 mm should be followed independent of the AAA. </p><p/><p>Although this model is helpful in guiding surveillance of small iliac artery aneurysms, it does not predict growth for common IAA &gt;26 mm. It also does not reflect the impact of smoking and hypertension on common IAA growth rates. </p><p>Other clinical studies have found increased expansion rates for larger versus smaller iliac artery diameters. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 201 patients found that after elective open infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a tube graft, aneurysmal common IAAs measuring 19 to 25 mm in diameter expanded more compared with normal caliber common iliac arteries over an average follow-up of 7.1 years (mean growth 2.4 mm versus 1.1 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expansion of IAAs following endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm was 1.5 mm for larger (&gt;16 mm) and 1.1 mm with smaller (&le;16 mm) iliac arteries over a mean follow-up of 44 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lastly, in a review of 438 patients with 715 common IAAs, 377 patients with 633 common IAAs had current or previously repaired AAA. Expansion rates were measured in 15 percent of the treated iliac aneurysms (n = 104). Of the common IAAs that were monitored for growth, 51 percent were &gt;3cm. The median growth rate for common IAAs &gt;3 cm was 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108704530\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of aneurysm and association with other aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an IAA also have a high incidence of aneurysms in the contralateral iliac artery and femoral arteries. The presence of these other aneurysms, particularly abdominal aortic aneurysm, impacts the management of the IAA. (See <a href=\"#H108756454\" class=\"local\">'Indications for repair'</a> below.)</p><p>Thus, it is important to perform a full arterial assessment when iliac aneurysm is detected because of the high rate of coexistent aneurysm.

Larger aneurysms (diameter &gt;6 cm) are more likely to be associated with the development of symptoms (compression, thrombosis, thromboembolism) or iliac artery rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/2,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29,30</a>]. In a study of internal IAAs, the mean size at diagnosis was 7.7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Approximately one-half of patients are asymptomatic and the IAA discovered incidentally at the time of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> imaging for a different indication.

The clinical presentation of external iliac artery aneurysm may be similar. A retrospective review found 11 cases of isolated true external iliac artery aneurysms.

As with the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the sensitivity of abdominal and rectal palpation in detecting IAA is probably dependent upon the size of the aneurysm.

Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound is the screening test of choice for asymptomatic patients, whereas for patients with symptoms, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography provides a more accurate diagnosis. The diagnostic accuracy of vascular imaging for iliac aneurysm is based upon sensitivities and specificities measured using these modalities to diagnose other vascular diseases, most notably, abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is often co-existent with iliac artery aneurysm. Specific considerations for imaging the iliac artery are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H15828721\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis is a good noninvasive technique to demonstrate iliac artery disease but imaging may be limited if the iliac vessels are tortuous or deep, and overlying bowel gas may obscure the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/33,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,50,51</a>]. The precise location of the aneurysm (common, external, internal iliac artery) may be difficult to determine on ultrasound. If the IAA can be adequately imaged with ultrasound, then ultrasound is generally used to follow the aneurysm over time for expansion. (See <a href=\"#H20037944\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance ultrasound'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) angiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60706%7ESURG%2F74061\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60706 graphicRef74061 \">image 2A-B</a>) is very accurate for diagnosing IAAs and provides extensive detail of aorto-iliac anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Ruptured and symptomatic aneurysms are repaired to reduce mortality associated with rupture, to relieve symptoms, and reduce the risk of future rupture. Early diagnosis, careful surveillance of small iliac aneurysms and repair of symptomatic and larger iliac aneurysms reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with IAA. Multiple studies have found that mortality ranges from 20 to 55 percent for emergent repair of IAA compared with approximately 1 percent for elective repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11,29,35,42,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,35,42,52</a>]. </p><p>Asymptomatic iliac artery aneurysm (IAA) is managed conservatively with serial imaging studies, or repaired.

The decision for elective repair is based on rupture risk, which depends upon aneurysm size and upon the expected expansion rate of the aneurysm relative to the patient&rsquo;s life expectancy. The presence of other aneurysms and the risk of rupture associated with them, particularly abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), also impacts decision-making.</p><p>All patients with IAA should be treated to manage their risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The management of risk factors associated with IAA is similar to that used to limit the expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysm and is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Given the natural history of iliac artery aneurysm with relatively slow growth rates and low rupture rates for iliac aneurysms &lt;3.5 cm, aneurysms up to 3.5 cm can probably be safely observed but more data is needed before confirming a higher threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/11,29,35,42,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,35,42,52</a>].

In a multicenter study, 147 patients who previously underwent open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a tube graft were included and divided into three groups based upon common iliac artery diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group A (n = 59): normal common iliac artery diameter &le;12 mm </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group B (n = 53): ectatic iliac arteries with a diameter that was 12 to 18 mm </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group C (n = 35): aneurysmal iliac arteries with a diameter &ge;18 mm </p><p/><p>After 5.5 years, common iliac arteries in Group A or B remained &le;25 mm and no patient experienced significant iliac artery growth. In group C, 10 of 35 patients had a common iliac artery diameter &ge;25 mm; three patients required surgery to treat the IAA during follow-up. If the preoperative iliac artery diameter is &ge;25 mm, a bifurcated graft should be used when treating AAA and IAA simultaneously. For patients with a life expectancy of more than 8 years, taking into account iliac artery expansion rates (discussed above), repair of AAA with a bifurcated graft is justified for an IAA with a diameter &ge;18 mm. </p><p>For patients with AAA undergoing endovascular repair, it is essential to provide adequate distal fixation of the iliac limb into the iliac artery. If appropriate apposition of the iliac endograft limb to the common iliac artery cannot be achieved due to aneurysmal dilatation, then the iliac aneurysm should be treated simultaneously. This is usually accomplished by extending the iliac limb of the AAA endograft into the external iliac artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iliac-artery-aneurysm/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

True aneurysms involve all layers of the vessel wall, whereas false aneurysms do not. The majority of aneurysms of the iliac arteries are true aneurysms. The common iliac artery is likely to be aneurysmal when it measures &gt;1.85 cm in adult males and &gt;1.5 cm in adult females. An internal iliac artery with a diameter more than 0.8 cm is consistent with aneurysm in most individuals. (See <a href=\"#H544011285\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20024761\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic issues'</a> above and <a href=\"#H108704530\" class=\"local\">'Site of aneurysm and association with other aneurysms'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliac artery aneurysms (IAAs) are most closely associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Up to 40 percent of patients who present with abdominal aortic aneurysm have at least one IAA. The common iliac artery is affected in 70 percent of patients who have IAA. (See <a href=\"#H108704530\" class=\"local\">'Site of aneurysm and association with other aneurysms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk factors for true aneurysm of the iliac artery are similar to other degenerative large vessel aneurysms and include smoking, hypertension, male sex, advancing age, and other large vessel aneurysm. Other causes are generally due to trauma, or iatrogenic instrumentation. (See <a href=\"#H107323044\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20024782\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of IAAs, either isolated or in association with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), is continued expansion over time. Similar to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), growth rates for IAAs depend upon diameter, with larger aneurysms having greater rates of expansion. (See <a href=\"#H20024782\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonruptured IAAs do not usually cause symptoms unless the aneurysm is large enough to compress surrounding structures. Less commonly, patients can present with symptoms of lower extremity ischemia due to arterial obstruction from iliac aneurysm thrombosis or distal embolization of intraluminal thrombus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm#H1231035344\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"#H20024782\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IAA rupture can be the initial presentation with acute abdominal, thigh, or groin pain, accompanied by hemodynamic instability. Rupture into adjacent structures (eg, rectum, ureter, bladder, iliac vein) can also occur. The average size of ruptured isolated iliac aneurysms is 5.5 cm. Mortality with rupture ranges from 50 to 100 percent with poor outcomes often related to a delay in diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H544011335\" class=\"local\">'Rupture'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-iliac-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of iliac artery aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IAAs are often diagnosed incidentally as a result of imaging tests performed in patients being evaluated for other problems such as abdominal or pelvic pain, other aneurysm, or peripheral artery disease. IAA is reliably diagnosed using ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. (See <a href=\"#H544011342\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ruptured IAA undergo emergent repair of the aneurysm to reduce mortality. Symptomatic IAA is repaired to relieve symptoms. Patients who have symptoms typically have larger aneurysms and are also at high risk for rupture. (See <a href=\"#H544011372\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For IAA &ge;3.0 cm in diameter, we suggest elective repair over conservative management in patients with a good operative risk and life expectancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with IAA &lt;3.0 cm are typically observed; however, repair of asymptomatic IAA below this threshold may be prudent or required during the course of managing other aneurysmal disease in the aorta or femoropopliteal segments. Rapid aneurysmal expansion, ie, &ge;7 mm in six months or &gt;10 mm in one year, increases the risk of IAA rupture and also indicates the need for repair. (See <a href=\"#H544011372\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no studies to help guide the follow-up of IAA. For patients who do not have an indication for iliac aneurysm repair, we perform serial physical examination and imaging at six-month intervals. If the size of the aneurysm is stable over several examinations, annual follow-up is reasonable.
