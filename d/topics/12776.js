Most of the oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, although a small amount dissolves into the plasma. The oxygen is then transported from the lungs to the peripheral tissues, where it is removed from the blood and used to fuel aerobic cellular metabolism. This process can be conceptualized as three steps: oxygenation, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption. In this topic review, oxygen delivery and consumption are reviewed. Oxygenation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial oxygen content (CaO<sub>2</sub>) is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin plus the amount of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>CaO<sub>2</sub> (mL O<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/dL)</span> = (1.34 x hemoglobin concentration x SaO<sub>2</sub>) + (0.0031 x PaO<sub>2</sub>)</p></div></div><p>where SaO<sub>2</sub> is the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and PaO<sub>2</sub> is the arterial oxygen tension. In dyshemoglobinemias, the oxygen content is calculated with the same equation, although the saturations (and therefore the oxygen content) will be different for a specific PaO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Normal CaO<sub>2</sub> is approximately 20 mL O<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/dL</span>.</p><p>Similarly, the mixed venous blood oxygen content (CvO<sub>2</sub>) is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin plus the amount of oxygen dissolved in mixed venous blood:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>CvO<sub>2</sub> (mL O<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/dL)</span> = (1.34 x hemoglobin concentration x SvO<sub>2</sub>) + (0.0031 x PvO<sub>2</sub>)</p></div></div><p>where SvO<sub>2</sub> is the mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation and PvO<sub>2</sub> is the mixed venous oxygen tension.

It can be measured directly or calculated. Both approaches assume that all unused oxygen passes from the arterial to the venous circulation.</p><p>Direct measurement of VO<sub>2</sub> is performed by respirometry. During respirometry, the patient breathes through a chamber that receives continuous air flow. Measurement of the oxygen depleted from the chamber, as well as the carbon dioxide and water vapor produced in the chamber, is used to determine VO<sub>2</sub>. Respirometry can be used in mechanically ventilated patients, but the accuracy of direct measurement of VO<sub>2</sub> diminishes at high oxygen concentrations (eg, &gt;80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].

It is most commonly expressed as the oxygen extraction ratio, which is the proportion of arterial oxygen that is removed from the blood as it passes through the microcirculation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>O<sub>2</sub> Extraction Ratio = (CaO<sub>2</sub> - CvO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">)/CaO<sub>2</sub></span></p></div></div><p>Normal O<sub>2</sub> extraction ratios range from 0.25 to 0.3.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under normal circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) is proportional to oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen extraction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen extraction are inversely proportional to one another</p><p/><p>At rest, VO<sub>2</sub> remains constant over a wide range of oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) because changes in DO<sub>2</sub> are balanced by reciprocal changes in oxygen extraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52578\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52578 \">figure 1</a>). VO<sub>2</sub> decreases if DO<sub>2</sub> declines to such a degree that it cannot be balanced by increasing oxygen extraction. The threshold value of DO<sub>2</sub> below which VO<sub>2</sub> will fall is called the &quot;critical DO<sub>2</sub>&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54410 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>When metabolic demand increases (eg, exercise, pregnancy), VO<sub>2</sub> also increases because more oxygen is required to maintain aerobic cellular metabolism. This is normally achieved by increasing both DO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. VO<sub>2</sub> is disproportionately impacted by the increased oxygen extraction, with the increased DO<sub>2</sub> contributing little [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Enhanced extraction of oxygen is probably mediated at the capillary level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Recent studies suggest dysregulation of peripheral extraction may play an important role in limiting exercise capacity in some disorders such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ABNORMALITIES OF OXYGEN DELIVERY AND DEMAND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased oxygen delivery or increased metabolic demand are common sequelae of medical illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased oxygen delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) will decrease if cardiac output falls or arterial oxygen content (CaO<sub>2</sub>) declines.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac output can decrease due to cardiac disease or hypovolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CaO<sub>2</sub> can decrease due to anemia or poor oxygenation. The latter can be caused by lung disease (eg, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, diffusion limitation), a right-to-left shunt, diminished inspired oxygen, or hypoventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In the setting of diminished DO<sub>2</sub>, maintenance of a normal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) can be accomplished by a compensatory increase in oxygen extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If increased oxygen extraction is insufficient to maintain VO<sub>2</sub>, cardiac output will increase in an effort to improve DO<sub>2</sub>. VO<sub>2</sub> will fall if these actions are insufficient and DO<sub>2</sub> is below the critical DO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased metabolic demand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic demand is elevated in critically ill patients (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/3,6,14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,14-21</a>]. VO<sub>2</sub> increases because more oxygen is required to maintain aerobic cellular metabolism. In critically ill patients, VO<sub>2</sub> elevation may be disproportionately accomplished by increasing the DO<sub>2</sub>. This is different from healthy individuals in whom VO<sub>2</sub> elevation is disproportionately accomplished by increasing the oxygen extraction, with DO<sub>2</sub> contributing little [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Whether such a difference exists between healthy and critically ill individuals is controversial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proponents believe that VO<sub>2</sub> is disproportionately affected by DO<sub>2</sub> because oxygen extraction is impaired during critical illness. Supporting this hypothesis, lactic acidosis is often present despite increased DO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In other words, anaerobic metabolism is required despite an increased supply of oxygen. Ineffective oxygen extraction may be due to poor oxygen uptake or poor utilization by the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opponents argue that both VO<sub>2</sub> and DO<sub>2</sub> were calculated in most of the studies that suggest that DO<sub>2</sub> has a disproportionate impact on VO<sub>2</sub> during critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This could introduce mathematical coupling errors, which would falsely increase the strength of the relationship between VO<sub>2</sub> and DO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, VO<sub>2</sub> was not disproportionately affected by DO<sub>2</sub> in the few studies that directly measured VO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/3,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25-28</a>].</p><p/><p>We believe that the relationship between DO<sub>2</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub> in critically ill patients is similar to that in healthy patients during increased metabolic demand (eg, exercise, pregnancy). In other words, we believe that increased oxygen extraction, and not increased DO<sub>2</sub>, has the greatest impact on increasing the VO<sub>2</sub> in critically ill patients. We base this belief on the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous studies have evaluated the impact of augmenting DO<sub>2</sub> on VO<sub>2</sub> with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/3,7,9,25-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,9,25-44</a>]. Methods of augmenting DO<sub>2</sub> have included inotropic agents, saline loading, and vasodilators to improve cardiac output, as well as red blood cell transfusions to increase arterial oxygen content (CaO<sub>2</sub>). Regardless of the intervention, DO<sub>2</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub> were strongly correlated when VO<sub>2</sub> and DO<sub>2</sub> were both calculated, but not when VO<sub>2</sub> was directly measured.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A few studies have evaluated the impact of augmenting DO<sub>2</sub> and patient-centered outcomes, such as survival, organ failure, length of ICU stay, and length of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygen-delivery-and-consumption/abstract/35,37-39,45-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37-39,45-51</a>]. While some of the studies found an improvement in morbidity or mortality, others found no effect or potential harm. Those that demonstrated improvement had significant methodologic problems, such as baseline differences between the treatment and control groups, and failure to use an intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p/><p>Taken together, we believe there are insufficient data to warrant the routine augmentation of DO<sub>2</sub> in critically ill patients if there is no evidence of ongoing tissue hypoxia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspired oxygen from the environment moves across the alveolar-capillary membrane into the blood and is then transported to the peripheral tissues.
