Therefore, the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency depends upon a critical level of clinical suspicion. Adrenal crisis should be considered in any patient who presents with peripheral vascular collapse (vasodilatory shock), whether or not the patient is known to have adrenal insufficiency. Likewise, isolated corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency, although rare, should be considered in any patient who has unexplained severe hypoglycemia or hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150357769\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266394312\"><span class=\"h2\">Exogenous glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged administration of pharmacologic doses of synthetic glucocorticoids is by far the most common cause of corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency and consequent adrenal insufficiency.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The principles involved in weaning patients from chronic high-dose glucocorticoid therapy are discussed elsewhere.

While the diagnosis may be obvious when classic symptoms and signs are present, early symptoms (such as fatigue and lassitude) are nonspecific. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result, the possible presence of adrenal insufficiency is sometimes overlooked while other possibilities are pursued:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss and gastrointestinal complaints may raise suspicion of gastrointestinal malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous hyperpigmentation is not always present. Hyperpigmentation is absent in some patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and in all patients with secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, hyperpigmentation can be caused by antineoplastic, antimalarial, and other drugs, such as tetracyclines, phenothiazines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and by heavy metals.

Although laboratory testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, both laboratory and patient errors can cause misleading results. One way to minimize these errors is to make certain that the different tests are internally consistent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-in-the-laboratory-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles in the laboratory evaluation of adrenocortical function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Further complicating the diagnosis is the fact that the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency, autoimmune adrenalitis, is a process that usually worsens over a period of many months or years. Two groups followed patients with adrenal autoantibodies but no evidence of adrenal insufficiency for three to five years and concluded that there were four stages in the development of adrenal insufficiency:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1: High plasma renin activity and normal or low serum aldosterone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2: Impaired serum cortisol response to ACTH stimulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3: Increased morning plasma ACTH with normal serum cortisol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 4: Low morning serum cortisol and overt clinical adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]</p><p/><p>Thus, by the time the patient has developed low serum cortisol concentrations, adrenal destruction is essentially complete.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum cortisol concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency of any cause depends entirely upon the demonstration of inappropriately low cortisol production. Most tests use total serum cortisol as the diagnostic measurement. Caution should be taken in interpreting the results in patients with abnormalities of cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) or albumin, such as patients with cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, or those taking oral estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In these settings, decreased or increased levels may lead to an incorrect diagnosis. Salivary or serum free cortisol have been suggested as alternatives but are not widely available, and criteria for response have not been developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150357819\"><span class=\"h3\">Morning serum cortisol concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal subjects, serum cortisol concentrations are higher in the early morning (about 6 AM), ranging from 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (275 to 555 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> than at other times of the day. An early morning low serum cortisol concentration (less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [80 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> is strongly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>One report evaluated the utility of basal morning serum cortisol measurements in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Values below 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (138 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> had almost 100 percent specificity, but only 36 percent sensitivity (as defined by a subnormal serum cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia). Using a higher serum cortisol of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (275 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> as the criterion for adrenal insufficiency increased the sensitivity to 62 percent, but reduced the specificity to 77 percent. Thus, a low morning serum cortisol concentration alone is not a reliable predictor of deficient adrenal function.</p><p>Similar considerations apply to high serum cortisol values. A morning serum cortisol concentration of more than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (415 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> predicts a normal serum cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia or a short ACTH test in virtually all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/12,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16-19</a>]. A morning serum cortisol greater than 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> is even more reassuring, and if increased CBG levels are not suspected (eg, patient is not on estrogen), then no further testing is required.</p><p>However, occasional patients with partial secondary adrenal insufficiency (based on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> or insulin tests, but with normal basal cortisol values) have had an inadequate clinical response to the stress of surgery or sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The overall clinical importance of these observations is not clear because the prevalence of the scenario is not known. Additionally, some studies suggest that normal subjects do not require elevated serum cortisol concentrations after a stress such as major abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] to survive and recover from the surgery in a normal fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150358186\"><span class=\"h3\">Morning salivary cortisol concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similarly, a salivary cortisol concentration at 8 AM above 5.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (16 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> excludes adrenal insufficiency, whereas a value below about 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> makes the probability of adrenal insufficiency high. The test has been used to screen for adrenal insufficiency, but has not been fully validated as the only diagnostic test.

Unfortunately, plasma ACTH results are usually not available immediately and it is important (as with the patient who presents in shock) to determine quickly whether primary adrenal insufficiency is the cause. This can be done indirectly by stimulating the adrenal gland with exogenous ACTH. It is useful to measure plasma ACTH and serum cortisol before injecting the ACTH; however, in the acute setting, the cortisol response will be used to make the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and a decision regarding ongoing treatment. The ACTH value, generally available later, can be used to establish the level of the defect.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Short ACTH stimulation tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> should be performed in virtually all patients in whom the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is being considered, unless the diagnosis has been ruled out by a basal serum cortisol value in the upper end of the reference range or higher. The agent used is synthetic ACTH(1-24) (cosyntropin), which has the full biologic potency of native ACTH(1-39). In healthy individuals, cortisol responses are greatest in the morning, but in patients with adrenal insufficiency, the response to cosyntropin is the same in the morning and afternoon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. As a result, it is best to perform the test in the morning to avoid a falsely abnormal result in a healthy subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A standard high dose and a low dose test are available.

A cosyntropin dose of 0.5 mcg per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> dose has also been suggested, as it has the advantage of compensating for plasma volume. However, it may not result in the same peak serum cortisol concentrations at 30 minutes as a 1 mcg dose because the peak with the smaller dose tends to be reached earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, the 1 mcg dose is recommended over a lower dose.

Cortisol secretion is deficient in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency despite the fact that their ability to secrete corticotropin (ACTH) is intact. Conversely, patients with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency have intrinsically normal but atrophic adrenal glands that are capable of producing cortisol but fail to do so because ACTH secretion is deficient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-and-tertiary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Basal plasma ACTH, renin, and aldosterone concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the basal plasma ACTH concentration can usually distinguish between these disorders.

When coupled with simultaneous measurement of basal serum cortisol, measurement of plasma ACTH may both confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and establish its cause. This measurement can be done with the cortisol when the suspicion is high; alternatively, ACTH can be measured after the diagnosis is established. When there is no urgency in establishing the cause of adrenal insufficiency, as in patients with chronic mild symptoms and signs, treatment decisions may await the results of these tests.</p><p>The approach is somewhat different in previously undiagnosed patients who present in hypotensive crisis. These patients may have adrenal insufficiency or one of several other possible diagnoses. Furthermore, adrenal insufficiency, if present, may have been caused by infection, a bleeding diathesis, or metastatic disease that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. In these patients, measurement of basal serum cortisol will potentially confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>While a basal plasma ACTH, renin, and aldosterone measurement may be ordered with the cortisol measurement, treatment must proceed immediately without waiting for the test results. Often resuscitation includes empiric <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> treatment so that the short <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> cannot be performed immediately.

Plasma levels of renin and aldosterone are usually unaffected in secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency, but mineralocorticoid deficiency can sometimes occur after very prolonged deficiency of ACTH. Serum sodium is often decreased with normal serum potassium secondary to increased vasopressin levels resulting from its decreased inhibition by cortisol.

The atrophic adrenal glands in secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency recover cortisol secretory capacity if chronically exposed to ACTH, whereas the adrenal glands in primary adrenal insufficiency are partially or completely destroyed, are already exposed to maximally stimulating levels of endogenous ACTH, and cannot respond to additional ACTH.</p><p>Because this test requires hospitalization and is more expensive than measurement of plasma ACTH, it is rarely used except in complicated clinical settings or when the ACTH or cortisol results are non-diagnostic. As an example, a patient treated for presumed adrenal insufficiency may have secondary adrenal insufficiency as a result of treatment. If the initial diagnosis is in question, a prolonged ACTH infusion may be used to differentiate between primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, so that weaning of the glucocorticoid replacement might be considered.

The single-dose overnight metyrapone test is as reliable and quicker than the standard three-day test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and has the additional value of being apparently safe for outpatient use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].
