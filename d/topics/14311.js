This is a spectrum of disorders that ranges from the more benign lymphomatoid papulosis (which almost always regresses spontaneously) to the neoplastic primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL), and includes &quot;borderline&quot; cases with features of each.</p><p>This topic will focus on the diagnosis and management of PC-ALCL. The diagnosis and management of systemic ALCL and lymphomatoid papulosis are presented separately.

In an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, 157 cases of primary, localized CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder were documented over a 30-year timespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range 5 to 98 years). There was a slight male predominance (58 percent) and most cases were diagnosed in Whites (87 percent). Other epidemiologic reports have had similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177676750\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with PC-ALCL present with solitary or grouped nodules growing over weeks to months and measuring up to several centimeters. These nodules typically ulcerate with time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83089 \">picture 1</a>). The lesions regress in up to 50 percent of cases but rarely completely resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Multifocal disease is rare at the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83091\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83091 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83092\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83092 \">picture 3</a>) and extracutaneous spread occurs in up to 13 percent of cases, at the time of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Skin biopsy specimens are characterized by a dense dermal infiltrate that does not usually involve the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. The infiltrate is comprised of cohesive sheets of large CD30-positive tumor cells that morphologically resemble those of systemic ALCL (ie, large cells with abundant pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm and round or pleomorphic, often horseshoe-shaped nuclei with prominent nucleoli). Approximately one-quarter have an atypical, non-anaplastic appearance. Reactive lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils are commonly present in the periphery of the lesion and in ulcerating lesions in association with epidermal hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma#H5617650\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Classical variant'</a>.)</p><p>By definition, at least 75 percent of the tumor cells express CD30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. In addition, most cases express CD4 and have variable loss of CD2, CD3, and CD5. Most cases are positive for cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA, HECA-452), but, unlike systemic ALCL, they lack expression of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Immunophenotype'</a>.)</p><p>Most cases show clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor (TCR) genes, although TCR proteins are often not expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. Unlike systemic ALCL, PC-ALCL do not have gene rearrangements involving the ALK gene on chromosome 2p23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2257773564\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PC-ALCL requires a representative biopsy. Excisional biopsies are preferred to incisional biopsies. If a punch biopsy is taken, the diameter should be at least 4 millimeters. The biopsy specimen is evaluated for morphology, growth pattern, and immunohistochemical studies. The diagnosis is based upon the presence of characteristic findings on biopsy specimens in conjunction with the clinical features found on presentation. (See <a href=\"#H3177676750\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p>All patients with a presumed diagnosis of PC-ALCL should undergo a staging assessment to confirm the absence of systemic disease. This evaluation includes a physical examination, complete blood count with differential, and radiographic staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. For imaging, we prefer a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan combined with positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT),</span> but a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is acceptable if PET is not available. The utility of a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate in the absence of clinically or radiographically detectable disseminated disease remains debatable, but we do suggest it. Others reserve bone marrow examination for patients with multifocal tumors, unexplained cytopenias, and those with documented extracutaneous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A clinical or radiographic suspicion of disseminated disease should be confirmed by biopsy since local or regional nodes may be abnormal due to inflammation alone. Of importance, the presence of pathologic involvement of local nodes alone does not seem to portend an adverse prognosis in patients with PC-ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3535904525\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PC-ALCL present with solitary or grouped slowly enlarging nodules that demonstrate a CD30-positive lymphoid infiltrate on biopsy. The main entities that should be considered in the differential diagnosis are lymphomatoid papulosis, systemic ALCL, transformed mycosis fungoides, and reactive causes of CD30-positive lymphoid infiltrates.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP)</strong> &ndash; LyP is a recurrent, self-healing condition characterized by a papulonodular skin eruption with histologic features of a CD30-positive lymphoid proliferation of atypical T cells. In contrast to PC-ALCL, LyP lesions are usually smaller (&lt;2 cm) and resolve spontaneously after weeks to months, often leaving residual scars and hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,11</a>]. There is considerable clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic overlap between LyP and PC-ALCL. A waxing and waning clinical course is consistent with LyP. Skin lesions that do not spontaneously regress within eight weeks are suggestive of PC-ALCL. The term &quot;borderline&quot; is used for cases in which a distinction between PC-ALCL and LyP cannot be made despite careful clinical and pathologic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphomatoid-papulosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphomatoid papulosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transformed mycosis fungoides</strong> &ndash; About half of transformed mycosis fungoides and S&eacute;zary syndrome express CD30. A previous history of patch or plaque mycosis fungoides or erythroderma is suggestive of the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mycosis-fungoides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of S&eacute;zary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic lymphoma</strong> &ndash; As described above, all patients with a presumed diagnosis of PC-ALCL should undergo a staging assessment to confirm the absence of systemic disease. Involvement of regional lymph nodes does not necessarily indicate the presence of systemic disease as pathologic involvement of local nodes alone does not impact the prognosis in patients with PC-ALCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In patients with cutaneous lesions suggestive of PC-ALCL, expression of ALK or identification of a translocation involving ALK is highly suggestive of cutaneous involvement of systemic ALCL rather than PC-ALCL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-systemic-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Immunophenotype'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) can present with cutaneous lesions that may be difficult to distinguish from PC-ALCL. The cells can be anaplastic in appearance, express CD30, and are ALK negative. ATLL is caused by the human retrovirus HTLV-1 and the key distinguishing feature is the presence of HTLV-1 in the malignant cells of ATL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) expresses CD30 and rarely presents with cutaneous involvement. Unlike PC-ALCL, HL expresses CD15. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia</strong> &ndash; CD30-positive lymphoid infiltrates may develop in response to insect bites or infestations (eg, scabies), viral infections (eg, herpes simplex, varicella-zoster), and certain medications (eg, anticonvulsant drugs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These non-neoplastic causes are usually associated with a lower percentage of CD30-positive cells on biopsy, do not have a waxing and waning clinical course, and do not show T cell receptor (TCR<em>)</em> gene rearrangement on molecular genetic studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphomatoid-papulosis#H8448445\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphomatoid papulosis&quot;, section on 'CD30+ inflammatory and infectious diseases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3486491931\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key to the management of patients with PC-ALCL is to avoid overtreatment. Oncologists unfamiliar with the disease may recommend aggressive systemic chemotherapy including high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation when such steps are unnecessary and overly toxic. (See <a href=\"#H2787834435\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> below.)</p><p>Most data regarding management of recurrent, multifocal, or systemic PC-ALCL come from small cohort series, case reports, and small single-center trials. Interpretation of the available evidence is further complicated by the fact that patients with relapsing disease are treated with several therapies concurrently, thereby limiting assessment of the efficacy of individual modalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1309753570\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with PC-ALCL present with isolated lesions that can be managed with complete surgical excision (with negative margins) or radiation. Using this approach, the majority of patients will achieve a complete remission, although most will recur and require subsequent therapy.</p><p>For patients with solitary lesions without lymph node involvement, either of these modalities is acceptable. A choice is often made based on the location of the lesions and expertise available at the treatment center. For patients with pathologically confirmed, isolated involvement of local nodes, we suggest radiation to the primary lesion and the local node(s) rather than surgical excision alone or systemic therapy. In this setting, regional lymph node involvement does not appear to impart an adverse prognosis.</p><p>A retrospective cohort analysis evaluated the efficacy of surgical excision with or without radiation in 56 patients with CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among those with solitary PC-ALCL treated with surgical excision, 95 percent achieved a complete response and 41 percent recurred within a follow-up period of 22 months. Among those treated with surgery plus radiation, 64 percent recurred during a follow-up period of 55 months. This was not a randomized trial and the patient populations likely differ between the two groups. Even so, these results suggest that there is no compelling evidence that adding radiotherapy to complete surgical excision benefits patients with localized disease.</p><p>The optimal dose of radiation for PC-ALCL is not known. Electrons are frequently used with a dose of 36 to 40 Gy and a margin of at least 2 cm, though lower doses may be equally efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3624865569\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the vast majority of patients will attain a complete remission following initial therapy, most will recur within the first five years. The management of recurrent disease is largely dependent on the extent of disease. However, many patients will experience serial relapses and will be treated with each of the therapies described at some point during their disease course. A preferred order for their use has not been established. A choice is made based on the patient's prior treatment, the therapies' expected toxicities, and comorbid illnesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H767815173\"><span class=\"h3\">Localized lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous recurrences after primary surgery or radiation can be treated with the same modalities again, although multiple surgeries <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiple radiation treatments often induce morbidity or patient inconvenience over time. Given the tendency for spontaneous regression, recurrent lesions can be observed if they are not bothersome to the patient.</p><p>Patients who experience multiple recurrences for whom repeated surgical excision <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation could become excessively morbid are typically better served by systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1513033771\" class=\"local\">'Multiple lesions'</a> below.)</p><p>Case reports and small case series have described the use of topical therapies such as the immune response modifier <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], intralesional interferon alfa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a> gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Topical bexarotene can cause an intense localized retinoid dermatitis that often necessitates concomitant administration of topical corticosteroids.

In one study, 10 of 13 (77 percent) patients with PC-ALCL responded to oral methotrexate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In our experience, even once monthly dosing can be effective to maintain remissions. We limit maintenance to three years because 50 percent of patients treated with methotrexate for three years had evidence of hepatic fibrosis in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Before initiating long-term methotrexate therapy, screening for hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection is recommended. In patients with infection, this allows a decision whether to avoid the use of methotrexate, to try to eradicate the viral infection before initiating therapy, or to suppress viral replication during immunosuppressive therapy.

Most patients present in their sixth decade with slowly enlarging solitary or grouped nodules. The nodules typically ulcerate with time and, while up to half regress, they rarely completely resolve. (See <a href=\"#H544497575\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3177676750\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin biopsy usually demonstrates a dense dermal infiltrate comprised of CD30-positive tumor cells that morphologically resemble those of systemic ALCL. Unlike systemic ALCL, PC-ALCL lack expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and do not have gene rearrangements involving the <em>ALK</em> gene on chromosome 2p23. (See <a href=\"#H3177676750\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PC-ALCL is based upon the presence of characteristic findings on skin biopsy specimens in conjunction with the clinical features found on presentation. All patients with a presumed diagnosis of PC-ALCL should undergo a staging assessment to confirm the absence of systemic disease. A clinical or radiographic suspicion of disseminated disease should be confirmed by biopsy. Involvement of regional lymph nodes does not necessarily indicate the presence of systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H2257773564\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main entities that should be considered in the differential diagnosis are lymphomatoid papulosis, systemic ALCL, transformed mycosis fungoides, and reactive causes of CD30-positive lymphoid infiltrates. (See <a href=\"#H3535904525\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PC-ALCL is an indolent disease and avoidance of overtreatment is important. Most patients present with isolated lesions that can be managed with complete surgical excision (with negative margins) or radiation. Using this approach, the majority of patients will achieve a complete remission, although most will recur and require subsequent therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1309753570\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of recurrent disease is largely dependent on the extent of disease. Many patients will experience serial relapses.
