Generally, these are the result of soft tissue compression between a bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The consequences of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury range from nonblanchable erythema of intact skin to deep ulcers extending to the bone. </p><p>Pressure-induced injuries impose a significant burden not only on the patient but on the entire health care system. Reducing their frequency is an important component of current goals for patient safety, as evidenced by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) 5 Million Lives Campaign and the decision by the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to not reimburse hospitals for the treatment of hospital-acquired pressure-related injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Knowledge of factors contributing to the pathogenesis of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury allows the identification of patients at risk for ulcer development such that preventive measures may then be targeted to those specific patients. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury will be reviewed here. Prevention and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3711283010\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) made changes to their classification in April 2016 and suggested using the terminology &quot;pressure injury&quot; instead of &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; to describe these wounds. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76128204\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'NPUAP staging'</a>.)</p><p>These changes were made to recognize the fact that lesser degrees of skin damage due to pressure may not be associated with skin ulceration (Stage 1) and that deep tissue injury can occur without overlying skin ulceration (suspected deep tissue injury) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903 \">table 1</a>). However, their generalized term &quot;pressure injury&quot; does not address the many other types of injury that can result from pressure, such as rhabdomyolysis in an unconscious patient. Thus, we will use the term &quot;pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot; to encompass the broad range of ischemic damage that can be caused by prolonged pressure. The terms &quot;pressure-induced skin injury&quot; or &quot;pressure-induced soft tissue (or deep tissue) injury&quot; are used where specifically applicable. We use the term &quot;pressure injury&quot; when referring to the staging of a specific lesion as defined by the NPUAP classification (eg, unstageable pressure injury) or to replace the term &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; in studies published prior to this classification change that use &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; generically when the stage is not specified. We use the term &quot;pressure ulcer&quot; for the specific circumstance where the integrity of the skin surface is disrupted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries are among the most common conditions encountered in acutely hospitalized patients or those requiring long-term institutional care. The incidence varies widely by clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. An estimated 2.5 million pressure-induced injuries are treated each year in acute care facilities in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Methods of studying and reporting their incidence include direct patient examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], use of databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and surveys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These studies tend to be small and often involve only a single facility, making generalizability uncertain. Caution is required when interpreting the reported incidence and prevalence rates since the methodology and duration of follow-up varies between studies. The most accurate estimates are derived from studies where clinician-researchers have directly examined the patients. Studies have also differed on whether they included superficial ulcer stages (stage 1 ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62903 \">table 1</a>)). Although stage 1 pressure injuries are frequently encountered, many epidemiological studies have elected not to include them since they are difficult to reliably detect. </p><p>One study based on hospital billing codes showed an increase in the number of hospital stays involving pressure injuries in the United States by nearly 80 percent between 1993 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In more than 90 percent of cases, the pressure-induced injury was not the original cause of admission. Most patients were over age 65. More than one-half of the patients with pressure-induced injuries required subsequent care in long-term care facilities, compared with only 16.2 percent of patients without pressure-induced injuries. However, as coding practices have changed over time, and since this study did not include chart review or direct patient evaluation, changes identified may be overstated. </p><p>Most pressure-induced injuries develop during acute hospitalizations in spite of the adoption of national prevention objectives. Among patients in acute care hospitals, prevalence rates have ranged from 3 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/8,9,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,13-16</a>]. However, rates are higher in high-risk groups. In one report of patients in an intensive care unit, over 50 percent of patients developed a stage 1 or greater pressure injury when managed with a standard mattress bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Another cohort study observed that pressure injuries developed in 36 percent of older adult patients with a hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Pressure injuries also are common among patients admitted to nursing homes, with reported rates on admission ranging from 10 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/10,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19-21</a>]. Prevalence rates are generally lower (3 to 12 percent) among long-term nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/8,10,19,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,19,21-24</a>]. Studies using databases have found that 4 to 8 percent of nursing home residents develop stage 2 or deeper pressure injuries over six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>]. However, incidence rates (including stage 1 injuries) as high as 24 percent have been noted when residents were regularly examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], with over 70 percent of high-risk patients developing a pressure-induced injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. New models of nursing home care that emphasize culture change to promote more resident-centered care have not been associated with worsening rates of development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>The frequency of pressure-induced injuries among outpatients has not been well defined. However, they may be common among patients receiving home nursing services. One study reported a 9.2 percent prevalence of stage 2 or higher pressure injuries in a multistate sample of home care patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A retrospective review that evaluated the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) in 1.94 million patients at the time of enrollment in a home care program found a prevalence of 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among home care patients without a pressure injury on admission, another study noted a 6.3 percent incidence of ulcer development during the home care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76125456\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of a pressure-induced injury is a complex process that requires the application of external forces to the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, external forces alone are not sufficient to cause an ulcer; rather, the interaction of these forces with host-specific factors is what ultimately leads to tissue damage.</p><p>The traditional teaching is that the development of pressure-induced injury is due to a combination of pressure (force per unit area), friction, shearing forces (gravity effect on friction), and moisture, but other factors may contribute; friction and moisture may have a limited role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Pressure applied to the skin in excess of the arteriolar pressure (32 mmHg) prevents the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues, resulting in tissue hypoxia, accumulation of metabolic waste products, and free radical generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Pressure in excess of 70 mmHg for two hours results in irreversible tissue damage in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Ulcer formation may occur more rapidly with higher pressures. A synthesis of clinical, animal, and in vitro studies has suggested that pressure-induced injuries may develop with one to four hours of sustained pressure load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Tissues vary in their susceptibility to pressure-induced injury, with muscle being the most susceptible, followed by subcutaneous fat and then dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, extensive deep tissue damage can occur with initially little or no evidence of superficial tissue injury. A high-stage pressure injury is initiated as a deep tissue injury that may then progress to the surface. There is little evidence to suggest that high-stage pressure injuries develop as a gradual progression from stage 1 through stage 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/2,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76128773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>Pressures are greatest over bony prominences where weight-bearing points come in contact with external surfaces, which can include immobilization devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A patient lying on a standard hospital mattress may generate pressures of 150 mmHg. Sitting produces pressures that are as high as 300 mmHg over the ischial tuberosities. Pressure over a bony prominence tends to result in a cone-shaped distribution with the most affected tissues located deep, adjacent to the bone-muscle interface. Thus, the extent of injury to deep tissues is often much greater than perceived from the visible ulcer on the skin surface, and the skin changes are just the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Although hypoxia has traditionally been considered the main factor in the development of pressure-related skin and soft tissue injury, it is increasingly recognized that compression and reperfusion injury also play an important role. In animal models, two hours of compression will result in irreversible muscle damage, whereas damage from tourniquet-induced ischemia over the same period of time was reversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In an animal model, a neuronal mechanosensor responsible for pressure-induced vasodilation appears to be protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Shearing forces occur when patients are placed on an inclined surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60284\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60284 \">figure 1</a>). Deeper tissues, including muscle and subcutaneous fat, are pulled downward by gravity, while the superficial epidermis and dermis remain fixed through contact with the external surface. The result is stretching, angulation, and trauma to local blood vessels and lymphatics. Shear forces alone may not cause ulceration but appear to have an additive effect such that in the presence of pressure, more severe tissue damage will occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Superficial lesions are primarily the result of moisture and friction and perhaps should not even be considered pressure injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/2,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,36</a>]. Exposure to moisture in the form of perspiration, feces, or urine may lead to skin maceration and predispose to superficial ulceration. There is little evidence to suggest what the magnitude of the contribution of moisture is to the development of skin injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Friction occurs when patients are dragged across an external surface. This results in an abrasion with damage to the most superficial layer of skin. Friction contributes most to stage 2 pressure injuries, with limited contributions to stage 3 or stage 4 injuries, since it does not cause the necrotic changes associated with deep tissue injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76126129\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 100 risk factors for the development of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries have been identified in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Risk factors can be divided into those that impact the magnitude and duration of pressure and those that affect individual susceptibility and tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The most important factors include immobility, malnutrition, reduced perfusion, and sensory loss, which are discussed below.</p><p>Other risk factors have included cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, recent lower extremity fractures, incontinence, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/7,43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,43-47</a>]. But whether these are independent risk factors or simply reflect the high prevalence of immobility among frail, older adult patients is not known for certain. As an example, urinary incontinence is frequently cited as a predisposing factor, with some studies suggesting that incontinent patients have up to a fivefold higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, there is a strong correlation between incontinence and immobility. A national survey of nursing home discharges found that 94 percent of incontinent patients with pressure injuries were bed- or chair-bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Urinary incontinence often does not remain as an independent predictor of pressure-induced injury in risk-adjusted analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76125515\"><span class=\"h2\">Immobility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immobility is the most important host factor that contributes to development of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury. Immobility may be permanent or transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There is a high correlation between a lack of spontaneous nocturnal movements in studies using devices that measure body movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, methods to measure immobility in clinical settings are generally not available. Accordingly, investigators have often relied upon clinical characteristics as markers for immobility, including functional measures such as whether patients are ambulatory or bedbound as well as clinical information such as a history of cerebrovascular accident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76125527\"><span class=\"h2\">Malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malnutrition is also a risk factor for the development of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries. Animal studies have found that more severe pressure-induced skin destruction occurred in malnourished animals than in well-nourished animals exposed to similar amounts of pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, cross-sectional studies have suggested that patients with pressure injuries are more likely to have hypoalbuminemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/46,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50</a>].</p><p>It is unclear which nutritional measures best predict risk, although prealbumin levels are often used in clinical practice. There is no lab value that gives an indication of risk. The strongest nutritional measure may simply be whether the patient has adequate dietary intake and can maintain <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/26,50,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,50,52</a>]. Among nursing home residents, lower body mass index has also been shown to be a strong predictor (&lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>The role of nutrition in prevention and treatment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76125533\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced skin perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of inadequate skin perfusion has been increasingly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In the setting of decreased perfusion, pressure applied to the skin for less than two hours may be sufficient to cause severe damage. When vital organs such as the kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract are not adequately perfused, blood flow to the skin will also be decreased, which increases the risk for the development of pressure-induced injuries.</p><p>Factors that contribute to reduced perfusion include volume depletion, hypotension, vasomotor failure, and vasoconstriction (secondary to shock, heart failure, or medications), and underlying peripheral artery disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies have reported an association between low blood pressure and pressure injuries, although this has not been consistently found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/26,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,56,57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A global measure of disease severity, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score, has been associated with pressure injuries in the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] but not among other hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Another illness severity measure, the Comprehensive Severity Index (CSI), has been associated with the pressure injuries among nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated skin blood flow over bony prominences during surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A fivefold intraoperative increase in skin blood flow was seen in patients who did not develop a postoperative pressure-induced injury, compared with no increase in skin blood flow in patients who did develop a pressure injury.

A comprehensive history and physical examination should identify potentially correctable predisposing factors.

Reducing the prevalence of pressure injuries is a national goal in the United States as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External factors that lead to the development of pressure injuries include pressure, shearing forces, friction, and moisture. Interaction of external factors with host-specific factors such as immobility, incontinence, and compromised nutritional status culminates in tissue damage. Decreased skin perfusion resulting from hypotension, shock, or peripheral artery disease is increasingly recognized as an important cause. (See <a href=\"#H76125456\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge of factors contributing to the pathogenesis allows the identification of patients at risk for development of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury. Preventive interventions may then be targeted to those specific patients. (See <a href=\"#H76126129\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using risk prediction tools to identify patients at risk for the development of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injuries (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Among the available risk prediction tools, the Braden scale may be the best choice in the United States, given widespread familiarity with it. Depending upon the measured level of risk, specific interventions may then be initiated or altered accordingly.
