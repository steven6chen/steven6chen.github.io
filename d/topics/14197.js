It forms the third component of the classical triad of Graves' disease (goiter, ophthalmopathy, pretibial myxedema). It is not restricted to the pretibial area but may spread to the ankle and dorsum of the foot and may present on the elbows, knees, upper back, and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pretibial myxedema used to occur in up to 5 percent of patients with Graves' disease and 15 percent of patients with Graves' disease and ophthalmopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], but the incidence of pretibial myxedema has declined considerably, probably because the diagnosis of Graves' hyperthyroidism is now established much earlier and antithyroid therapy is initiated sooner.</p><p>Pretibial myxedema also occurs, very rarely, in patients with no past or present thyroid dysfunction and in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of pretibial myxedema will be reviewed here. Other clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretibial myxedema results from the accumulation in the dermis of glycosaminoglycans (GAG), especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, secreted by fibroblasts under the stimulation of cytokines. The cytokines arise from the lymphocytic infiltration, which is best seen in early lesions. The resulting characteristic pathologic changes are mucinous edema and the fragmentation of collagen fibers with deposition of acid mucopolysaccharides (hyaluronic acid) in the papillary and reticular dermis, with subsequent extension into deeper tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. An increased number of fibroblasts have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Clinically, one sees nonpitting edema of the dermis, due both to the hydrophilic nature of these substances and secondarily to compression of dermal lymphatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and fragmentation of dermal collagen fibers.</p><p>The etiology of pretibial myxedema is not proven. These patients characteristically have very high serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies when compared with patients with fewer manifestations of Graves' disease.</p><p>The demonstration of TSH receptor protein expression by normal dermal fibroblasts raises the possibility that TSH-receptor antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antigen-specific T cells initiate the inflammatory response, which stimulates the production of GAG by these cells, as seen in the accompanying Graves' orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon induce GAG release from fibroblasts and may be secreted by Th1 type T cells activated by TSH receptor antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>An etiologic role for TSH receptor antibodies and TSH receptor-specific T cells could also explain the occasional worsening of dermopathy after trauma, surgery, and radioiodine therapy for hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among them, trauma to the pretibial region may be the most common precipitating factor initiating an inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], and it has been seen occasionally after thyroid surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tobacco use may also be a risk factor for the development of dermopathy, similar to its role in increasing the risk for thyroid eye disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57417960\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretibial myxedema is characterized by bilateral, asymmetric, nonpitting, scaly thickening and induration of the skin, most commonly as one or a few well-demarcated papules or nodules several centimeters in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They may be violaceous or slightly pigmented (yellow-brown) and often have an orange-peel appearance. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic or even painful. The most frequent location of pretibial myxedema is over the lower legs, especially the pretibial areas or the dorsum of the foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75580\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75580 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64524\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64524 \">picture 2</a>). Rarely, the fingers and hands, elbows, arms, or face are affected. The lesions usually appear over a period of several months and then stabilize or, in some cases, regress spontaneously. In rare patients, however, the lesions progress to involve the legs, feet, or hands completely, resulting in a form reminiscent of elephantiasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F88932\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88932 \">picture 3</a>). The skin is thickened, woody, firm, with edema, skin fibrosis, and verrucous nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 178 patients followed for an average of 7.9 years, the following was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpitting edema was the most prevalent form of dermopathy (43 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretibial area was most commonly involved (99 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually all patients had coexisting ophthalmopathy (97 percent)</p><p/><p>Pretibial myxedema is rarely the presenting feature of autoimmune thyroid disease (ie, preceding abnormalities in thyroid function tests) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>]. The development of pretibial myxedema is not related to thyroid function, and patients may be hyperthyroid, euthyroid, or hypothyroid at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients may have other signs of hyperthyroidism, including clubbing of the fingers and osteoarthropathy of the phalanges of the hands and feet (thyroid acropachy), or symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism may be absent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>). Specific ocular findings in patients with coexisting Graves' orbitopathy may include periorbital edema, conjunctival injection and edema, proptosis, and extraocular muscle dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TSH receptor antibodies are persistently elevated in almost 100 percent of patients with Graves' disease and pretibial myxedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57418037\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pretibial myxedema is based upon the history and the characteristic clinical appearance of the skin lesion (the location, nonpitting nature, and distinct borders of the lesions). Punch biopsy is rarely necessary for diagnosis, particularly when the characteristic skin lesion develops in a patient with active hyperthyroidism or history of hyperthyroidism and Graves' ophthalmopathy. Punch biopsy of the skin may be necessary in patients who present with skin lesions in the absence of active hyperthyroidism or history of autoimmune thyroid disease. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) can be detected on hematoxylin and eosin staining and confirmed with alcian blue, colloidal iron, or toluidine blue. Periodic acid-Schiff reaction (PAS) is negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretibial myxedema may resemble the skin lesions caused by inflammatory dermatoses, such as stasis dermatitis from chronic lymphatic and venous obstruction of the legs, chronic dermatitis, and cutaneous mucinosis (in patients with lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, scleroderma). It may also resemble lichen amyloidosis, hypertrophic lichen planus, and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. However, when the patient is known to have Graves' disease, none of these skin diseases in the differential diagnosis are likely to apply. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stasis-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stasis dermatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrobiosis-lipoidica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrobiosis lipoidica&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with pretibial myxedema do not seek treatment, because the extent of the lesions is limited, and they are asymptomatic. The usual indications for treatment are pruritus, local discomfort, or the unsightly appearance of the lesions. However, it is reasonable to treat all new lesions in the hope of preventing them from becoming more chronic. Treatment is less effective in chronic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>]. The treatment approach described below is based upon case series and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>The initial treatment includes minimizing risk factors, such as sensibly avoiding tobacco, reducing weight, and normalizing thyroid function. Normalization of thyroid function does not necessarily improve the myxedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, severe disease is most often encountered in patients with longstanding untreated Graves' thyroid disease. Some experts advocate the use of compression stockings (20 to 30 mmHg) to improve lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/1,3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,13</a>].</p><p>For initial pharmacologic therapy, medium to high potency topical corticosteroids with or without occlusion or intralesional corticosteroids are our suggested approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). We use the topical application of a glucocorticoid ointment covered by an occlusive dressing (eg, 0.025% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinolone</a> acetonide) under plastic wrap nightly or every other night. We use intralesional corticosteroids if there is no improvement with topical treatment after 4 to 12 weeks, especially for plaque and nodular forms of dermopathy. In an old prospective study, nine patients with pretibial myxedema were treated with intralesional injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide. Complete resolution was obtained in seven of the nine patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There are no more recent trials of treating this now uncommon disease. However, this regimen will often lead to regression of the lesions, especially those that are no more than a few months old. Once the lesions regress, the frequency of glucocorticoid application can be reduced. Resistant lesions may require systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Some cases can spontaneously resolve after several years.</p><p>Longstanding pretibial myxedema may be quite resistant to all therapy. For more severe cases, some have recommended intensive treatment of coexisting lymphedema with physiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A number of case reports have suggested that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> may be helpful in resistant cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This drug prevents the proliferation of fibroblasts. In other case reports, B cell depletion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and plasmapheresis were found to be helpful in severely affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> has been reported to be effective in an uncontrolled case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Surgical excision has also been tried, but as described above, such trauma almost always precipitates a recurrence of the disease and should not be attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little is documented about long-term outcomes in patients with pretibial myxedema. However, in a retrospective study of 178 patients followed for an average of 7.9 years, more severe cases, which were treated with topical glucocorticoids, occurred in 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with milder forms (40 percent) did not receive any therapy. Overall, 50 percent of patients had moderate improvement or complete remission, while 50 percent had minimal or no improvement. Patients who were untreated had a tendency for better outcome, but these were the patients with milder disease. All five patients with the most severe disease (elephantiasis) were less likely to have remission despite treatment with steroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretibial myxedema results from the accumulation in the dermis of glycosaminoglycans (GAG), especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, secreted by fibroblasts under the stimulation of cytokines.
