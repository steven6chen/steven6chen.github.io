Imaging has been limited to intraoperative observations and occasional MRI and CT scans. However, high resolution ultrasound has opened up this field to clinicians, and modestly priced portable instruments are now routinely available that can provide qualitative and quantitative details about nerve and muscle disease.</p><p>This topic will review the use of ultrasound for the evaluation of neuromuscular disease. Electrodiagnostic methods for neuromuscular disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971315\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL AND HISTORICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since its first use in the 1950s for medical practice, ultrasound has evolved into a sophisticated imaging modality employed by specialists to diagnose a broad range of clinical disorders. Early instruments depended on single linear echo latencies to measure fetal head width or midline shift in adults with suspected intracranial mass lesions. Current technology, however, provides real-time two-dimensional images that can be reconstructed into three dimensions (3D) and their change over time (4D) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With the advent of inexpensive, portable units of sufficiently high resolution, the use of ultrasound in the evaluation of muscle and nerve disease is becoming commonplace.</p><p>The physics of ultrasound is briefly reviewed here as it is pertinent to the study of muscle and nerve and is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-essentials-physics-and-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography essentials: Physics and instrumentation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-safety-of-diagnostic-ultrasound-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and safety of diagnostic ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The fundamental technique of ultrasound involves the insonation of tissue and analysis of the echoes reflected back to the insonating transducer. Reflected ultrasound occurs at interfaces within or between tissues of different acoustic impedance, a measure directly proportional to the speed at which sound travels through them. Bone conducts sound much faster than soft tissue; soft tissue slightly faster than water, but much faster than air. As such, the brightest echoes in the body are seen between bone and soft tissue. The use of coupling gel between skin and transducer minimizes the reflection that would otherwise occur between skin and air.</p><p>The frequency of insonated sound determines resolution and depth of penetration. Higher frequencies provide better resolution of superficial structures because of their shorter wavelengths, but lower frequencies provide better images of deep structures, albeit at somewhat lower resolution. This is the same principle that explains why the low pitched rumble of thunder is audible for miles, but the sharp, high pitched sounds are only heard with nearby lightning strikes. Intraluminal ultrasound probes offer one means of obtaining high resolution in certain types of deep structures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravascular-ultrasound-optical-coherence-tomography-and-angioscopy-of-coronary-circulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy of coronary circulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to acoustic impedance, another property known as anisotropy is relevant to sonographic differentiation. Anisotropy is the tendency of tissues to reflect sound in a directionally dependent manner, as opposed to diffusely scattering the reflection. Different tissues exhibit variable degrees of anisotropy, and higher degrees of anisotropy result in differences in echogenicity when the ultrasound probe angle is changed. Using frequent, subtle adjustments in probe alignment, the skilled sonographer differentiates structures by observing the extent of this property in insonated tissues. As an example, tendons appear highly echogenic when the ultrasound probe is angled perpendicular to the tendon, but look almost anechoic when the probe is angled obliquely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Holding the probe perpendicular to the target minimizes the impact of anisotropy and is an approach often used to obtain standardized images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56630\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56630 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Almost any imaging probe can be used to study muscle, although small muscles, such as extensor digitorum brevis, are best evaluated using high-resolution transducers. Much of the literature on muscle ultrasound (often referred to as musculoskeletal ultrasound) deals with the study of structural disorders of muscle such as strains, tears, hernias, hematomas, tumors, and other mass lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In these conditions, the patient often can point to where the problem is. This report will primarily focus on uses of ultrasound in the study of neurologic disorders of muscle and nerve, where knowledge of localization is critical for identifying pathology and the distribution of neuromuscular involvement.</p><p>Ultrasound offers advantages over computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in that it provides real-time and dynamic capabilities, superior edge-to-edge resolution, and lower cost. However, it only provides a keyhole aperture, and as such, optimal use of ultrasound involves sophisticated clinical input to determine specifically where to look for pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971322\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND OF NORMAL MUSCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healthy muscle tissue has a distinctive appearance on ultrasound that readily distinguishes it from other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In the axial image, muscle consists of primarily echolucent (dark) areas interspersed with small bright curved echoes of seemingly random orientations. In the sagittal plane, however, these bright echoes are seen to be the fibrous tissue that surrounds muscle fibers and fascicles and which organizes into recognizable striations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68360\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68360 \">image 2</a>). In bipennate or multipennate muscles, a central aponeurosis can often be identified as an area of thickened fibrous tissue. If followed distally, this structure becomes the tendon. The angle of pennation is critical for determining force dynamics of muscle; because it is distorted in cadaveric specimens, studies involving this parameter should ascertain it from real-time imaging to make accurate determinations of in-vivo muscle function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971329\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound of muscle motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At rest, normal muscle is static with the exception of visible arterial pulsations. However, with slow contraction, the central portion of muscle can be seen to bulge with thinning of its more distal ends. In the area of bulging, thickening muscle fascicles can be seen to jostle for space in the increasingly pressurized environment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76097\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76097 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the sagittal view the angle of pennation can be seen to change as the muscle moves through its range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The bulk of muscle thickening occurs with low levels of muscle contraction and effort, which explains why body builders can demonstrate their physique while retaining a relaxed expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound can also be used to investigate kinesiology. As an example, with isometric dorsiflexion of the foot, the interosseous membrane separating the tibialis anterior from the tibialis posterior bulges posteriorly; with isometric foot inversion, it bulges anteriorly, reflecting the different activation of these two muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81006\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81006 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971336\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND OF DISEASED MUSCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is capable of providing useful real time feedback on the size of muscle and the presence of chronic pathologic changes in muscle. With special quantitative adaptations, the technique may provide additional information about more subtle or acute abnormalities.</p><p>There are four main findings that distinguish diseased muscle from healthy muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased echogenicity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased homogeneity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of the bone shadow</p><p/><p>Of these, increased echogenicity is the easiest to recognize. This results from replacement of normal muscle architecture with fat, fibrosis, loss of healthy muscle, and inflammation, all of which increase tissue reflections of sound. The highly organized nature of the myofibrillar structure of healthy muscle is conducive to sound transmission, whereas fat, inflammation, and fibrosis generate multiple microscopic reflectors of sound. The next most useful finding is atrophy, or loss of normal muscle bulk. This can be evaluated by comparison with published reference values of normal muscle size according to age; for unilateral disorders, side to side comparisons can be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Normal muscle shows very dark muscle tissue surrounded by bright tissue reflections from the supportive fibrous structure in muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As the muscle becomes more echogenic with progressive disease, the distinction between normal fibrous tissue and muscle blurs, making the image more homogeneous. Loss of the bone shadow results from increased attenuation of the ultrasound signal as sound is either reflected or absorbed by the increased fat, fibrosis, and other changes.</p><p>Unlike needle electromyography of muscle, which shows characteristic differences between myopathic and neurogenic findings, ultrasound often does not show a distinct difference between myopathic and neurogenic conditions pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55106\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55106 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60063\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60063 \">image 5</a>). However, the distribution of affected muscles often is informative with respect to etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. Myopathies generally tend to affect proximal muscles and polyneuropathies tend to affect distal muscles. In addition, myopathies often have characteristic distributions, affecting certain muscles more than others. As an example, inclusion body myopathy has a predilection for flexor pollicis longus but spares its antagonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unilateral changes restricted to a single root or nerve distribution are highly suggestive of focal nerve lesions. In some disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle enlargement occurs, and ultrasound effectively identifies hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute severe denervation of muscle leads to increased water content and swelling that cause measurable changes in echogenicity with sophisticated imaging analysis software [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, to simple inspection, such changes are equivocal, unlike changes by electromyography, which can be striking.</p><p>The utility of muscle ultrasound for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders is evolving, particularly in specialized ultrasound centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a 2008 review of prospective case-control studies, the sensitivities of visual evaluation of muscle echo intensity for the detection of a neuromuscular disorder in children ranged from 67 to 81 percent, and corresponding specificities ranged from 84 to 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among studies using methods that quantified muscle echo intensity (eg, by computerized image analysis), the sensitivities were higher and ranged from 87 to 92 percent. Thus, quantitative techniques may yield further improvements in the diagnostic utility of ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A number of studies suggest that ultrasound is sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of myopathy and muscular dystrophy in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. The degree of ultrasound changes in these disorders has also been shown to correlate with findings from other imaging studies and with histopathology. &#160; </p><p>Calcium deposition within muscle, a finding frequently seen following trauma, is easily identified by ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66872\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66872 \">image 6</a>). Subcutaneous vascular calcifications are also readily apparent with this technique, and may be seen in some inflammatory myopathies. Metabolic disorders of muscle, if they are not associated with significant histopathologic changes, typically do not show much change on ultrasound. Similarly, injection of botulinum toxin does little to alter muscle architecture and causes no change in echotexture. However, a single botulinum toxin injection causes measurable loss of muscle thickness at six weeks. This finding suggests that ultrasound might be useful as a biomarker to measure the progression of neuromuscular disease. In addition, ultrasound might be useful to assess the efficacy of therapeutic agents that slow the progression of muscle loss, or reverse atrophy of muscle, should such agents be found effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971343\"><span class=\"h2\">Dynamic changes in diseased muscle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most striking dynamic change in diseased muscle is probably the occurrence of fasciculations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These result from spontaneously discharging motor neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Fasciculations cause contraction of the entire motor unit (the motor axon and all the muscle fibers it innervates). Clinically, a fasciculation appears as a focal twitch in a muscle, and most patients with fasciculations have multiple different motor units that discharge erratically. Many fasciculations, detected by either electromyography (EMG) or by ultrasound, are not clinically apparent, as clinical recognition depends on their proximity to the surface of the muscle, the depth below the skin, and the size of the motor unit involved. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than EMG at detecting fasciculations, probably because it samples a larger muscle region than needle EMG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/6,17,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,26,27</a>]. However, it may be difficult to detect fasciculations on ultrasound in patients who are unable to completely relax. Ultrasound allows specific aspects of fasciculations to be studied, such as twitch contraction time, contraction and relaxation durations, cross sectional area involved by the twitch, and recurrence and serial study, but these features are largely of research significance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60193\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef60193 \">movie 2</a>).</p><p>A variety of other aspects of altered dynamic function of muscle are amenable to study by ultrasound, such as changes in angles of pennation in disorders of muscle shortening, loss of contractile thickening in myopathy or neurogenic weakness, slowed or increased relaxation times in thyroid disease, or myotonia or cramp, but such studies have largely gone unperformed. Several reports indicate that high resolution ultrasound can image fibrillations in muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. While this finding needs further verification, it would have significant ramifications regarding the evolution of the field.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971350\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND OF NORMAL NERVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With currently available high-end instrumentation and high-resolution probes, major upper extremity nerves and their distal branches can be followed from the axilla into the digits in the average patient. In the lower extremity, nerves can be followed from the gluteal region to the feet, but given the large diameter of the legs and the thickness of the feet and sole, it is more difficult to resolve proximal portions of the nerve and terminal branches. Portions of the brachial plexus are readily visible by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], but the lumbosacral plexus, because of its deep location, is not easily imaged in adults.</p><p>Nerves have a distinct appearance on ultrasound, but there is some variation in relation to nerve thickness and surrounding structures. A typical nerve has a honeycomb appearance with a somewhat echogenic external perineurium punctuated by hypoechoic rounded fascicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71933\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef71933 \">movie 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/5,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31,32</a>]. The number of apparent fascicles increases with the resolution of the ultrasound instrument. In contrast, nerve fascicles are not delineated on either CT or 3 Tesla MRI scans. At the wrist, when surrounded by hyperechoic tendons, the nerve appears relatively hypoechoic, and with lower resolution probes, the nerve has a speckled appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/5,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31</a>]. The ulnar nerve at the elbow, perhaps because of its approximation to the bony medial epicondyle, may seem somewhat hypoechoic. In general, nerves are rounded, but their shape varies as they course through the extremity, sometimes assuming a triangular or oval shape in accordance with the tissues they pass through. The median nerve normally flattens in the wrist as it enters the carpal tunnel.</p><p>The fascicular anatomy of nerve is somewhat complex. Major nerve branches are often separate but conjoined within the same nerve sheath for some distance. The peroneal and tibial branches of the sciatic nerve are most striking in this regard, but the motor and sensory branches of the radial nerve are separated into distinct fascicles well before the nerve branches in the forearm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58279\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58279 \">movie 4</a>). Branch points are most easily seen when the nerves split in the same horizontal plane as the direction of the nerve trunk. Deep or diving intramuscular branches are sometimes more difficult to image.</p><p>The brachial plexus has distinct anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The cervical nerve roots, although not visible within the spine, are visible shortly after exiting from the spinal foramina, and they can be seen descending in grouped bundles of fascicles to the subclavian artery. Although gross dissection reveals discrete trunks and cords, it is difficult to define their boundaries with ultrasound in the paraclavicular region where they are compacted together. The plexus can be difficult to image in the subclavicular region, but the nerves are more superficial and readily apparent in the axilla.</p><p>In general, nerves are readily distinguished from tendons, in that they are not freely movable, have different anatomic paths, and show less anisotropy. They are readily distinguished from arteries and veins because they do not pulsate and do not compress. In rare cases where there is venous thrombosis, the unique fascicular structure of the nerve, as well as its course and branching, should be sufficient to differentiate it from other structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The distal portions of cranial nerves can also be imaged with ultrasound. The optic nerve is visible within the orbit, but heat generated by the ultrasound probe can acutely cause cataracts in animals. Therefore, optic nerve evaluations should be done with specialized and safety-checked equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Branches of the facial nerve can occasionally be imaged as they course through the parotid gland, and both the spinal accessory and vagus nerves can be imaged in the cervical region.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971357\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal nerve movement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerves need to be able to move as extremities flex and extend, and as such are capable of movement in a <span class=\"nowrap\">proximal/distal</span> gradient. Ultrasound can demonstrate this type of movement, and also movement relative to nearby structures. For example, with fisting and extreme flexion of the wrist, the median nerve, which is normally situated on the palmar surface of the carpal tunnel, rotates 90 degrees and dives below the other flexor tendons, an observation only apparent with real-time ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74182\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef74182 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53081\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53081 \">movie 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].<strong> </strong>In addition, the nerve can be seen to move proximally and distally with flexion and extension of the digits, although much less than the tendons move [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Similarly, the ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove and the sciatic nerve proximal to the popliteal fossa can be seen to move relative to nearby structures with flexion of the extremity, and subluxation of the ulnar nerve out of the ulnar groove is readily apparent with dynamic imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64956\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64956 \">movie 7</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971364\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND OF NERVE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two consistent changes on ultrasound that can distinguish diseased nerves from normal nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlargement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of echogenicity</p><p/><p>The pathologic basis of these changes on ultrasound is incompletely understood but probably reflects a variety of vascular, inflammatory, or reactive changes.</p><p>Nerve enlargement and loss of echogenicity are commonly observed in most compressive neuropathies and hereditary demyelinating neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. These pathologic changes are convenient in terms of imaging because small diseased nerves (eg, small sensory branches), due to enlargement, are easier to identify on ultrasound than small healthy nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Enlargement can also be seen in inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, but this finding is variable and may be patchy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Increased nerve vascularity may also be present as detected by power Doppler imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Ultrasound has a more limited role in predominantly axonal neuropathies, where structural changes are generally mild or absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although not all studies are consistent, there are data suggesting that diffuse mild nerve enlargement on ultrasound is present at noncompressive sites in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].</p><p>High resolution ultrasound is particularly informative with respect to nerve compression syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and focal enlargement of the nerve is a robust indicator of local pathology.

The ultrasound finding is somewhat counterintuitive in that it is tempting to assume that the nerve is physically smaller in areas where it is compressed, and that it should be hyperechoic due to either reduction of <span class=\"nowrap\">myelin/axonal</span> girth or inflammation. However, detailed studies confirm that overall the median nerve is increased in size in CTS, typically even in areas of compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Because of the distal-proximal sliding of the median nerve at the wrist, the precise site in the carpal tunnel of maximal enlargement of the nerve may vary somewhat from wrist to wrist.</p><p>A different line of evidence has demonstrated a correlation of temporal improvement in nerve ultrasound variables with clinical improvement. As an example, one report noted that the median nerve cross sectional area and vascularity significantly improved following glucocorticoid injections for carpal tunnel syndrome in a timeline that closely tracked improvement in both clinical and electrodiagnostic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Similar studies have shown improvements in ultrasound parameters of the median nerve following surgical decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>The underlying mechanism of nerve swelling with focal compression is hypothesized to be related to damming of axoplasmic flow and increased small vessel blood flow, findings that are consistent with the reduced nerve echogenicity seen on ultrasound. Studies in animals with experimental low-grade compression of nerves show similar swelling distal and proximal to the compressed area, and it seems likely that this is common to many nerve entrapments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/54-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-59</a>].</p><p>Additional abnormalities that occur in CTS include flattening of the median nerve, and on occasion, diminished dimensions of the carpal tunnel itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Other evidence has suggested that nerves are less mobile in CTS, and in our experience, the nerve is less likely to move relative to the tendons in the carpal tunnel in affected patients. It is unclear how robust this finding is or if it is secondary to enlargement of the nerve or whether it reflects intrinsic changes in the freedom of movement of the nerve. Further studies should be informative. Studies looking at proximal and distal movement of the median nerve in CTS have yielded conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/34,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,61</a>]. It is technically challenging to measure this type of movement as it is difficult to identify discrete landmarks in the nerve as it moves in the sagittal plane. Other findings, such as a bifid median nerve, or a persistent median artery, may be relevant with regard to choosing a surgical approach to the disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76718\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76718 \">movie 8</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28971379\"><span class=\"h2\">Other compressive neuropathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the majority of ultrasound studies on nerve compression have examined patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, other studies of compressed nerve, such as the ulnar nerve at the elbow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71846\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71846 \">image 7</a>), have shown that nerve swelling is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-65</a>]. While the data are limited, the absence of conflicting findings suggests that focal nerve enlargement is a robust indicator of local pathology.

The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in such disorders is unknown, and will likely depend on the experience of the operator, the resolution of the instrument, and the degree of surrounding soft tissue changes associated with trauma. Other types of gross nerve lesions are readily identified by ultrasound, including neuromas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51601\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51601 \">movie 9</a>), ganglion cysts, neurofibromas, and neurolymphomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/69-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20833577\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accumulating evidence suggests that ultrasound is useful for detecting diffuse nerve hypertrophy that occurs in certain hereditary demyelinating neuropathies and multifocal nerve enlargement that occurs in demyelinating polyneuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease/abstract/27,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,75</a>].

In the axial image, muscle consists of primarily echolucent (dark) areas interspersed with small linear or curvilinear bright echoes. In the sagittal plane, these bright echoes are seen to be the fibrous tissue that surrounds both muscle fibers and fascicles, and is organized into recognizable striations (See <a href=\"#H28971322\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound of normal muscle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On ultrasound of muscle, both neurogenic and primary muscle diseases are associated with increased echogenicity, atrophy, increased homogeneity, and loss of the bone shadow. In some disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle enlargement occurs, and ultrasound effectively identifies hypertrophy. The most striking dynamic change in diseased muscle is probably the occurrence of fasciculations. (See <a href=\"#H28971336\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound of diseased muscle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With high-end ultrasound instrumentation and high-resolution probes, major upper extremity nerves and their distal branches can be followed from the axilla into the digits in the average patient. In the lower extremity, nerves can be followed from the gluteal region to the feet, but given the large diameter of the legs and the thickness of the feet and sole, it is more difficult to resolve proximal portions of the nerve and terminal branches. Portions of the brachial plexus are readily visible by ultrasound, but the lumbosacral plexus, because of its deep location, is not easily imaged in adults. (See <a href=\"#H28971350\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound of normal nerve'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High resolution ultrasound is particularly informative with respect to nerve compression syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and focal enlargement of the nerve appears to be a robust indicator of local pathology. Ultrasound may be useful for the study of inflammatory and traumatic neuropathies, and can identify neoplastic changes in nerves as well.
