Many factors such as temperature, perfusion volume and pressure, oxygenation, and degree of inflation may impact the likelihood of lung injury during storage or at the time of reperfusion, and also the function of the lung after transplantation.</p><p>Much of the experimental work in lung transplantation over the past decade has focused on optimizing methods of lung preservation to reduce the impact of ischemia-reperfusion injury on post-transplant lung function.</p><p>The preservation of donor lungs for lung transplantation will be reviewed here. An overview of lung transplantation and discussions of donor evaluation and management, the lung transplantation procedure, early postoperative care, and primary graft dysfunction are provided separately.

Key goals include preventing in situ thrombosis and vasospasm and stabilizing the lung for static cold storage. Lung donation after brain death or cardiac death is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Deceased donor evaluation&quot;, section on 'Donation after brain death'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Deceased donor evaluation&quot;, section on 'Donation after circulatory determination of death'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Donation after brain death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lung procurement operation is usually performed through a median sternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In sequence, the pulmonary arteries are dissected free from the ascending aorta and the superior vena cava is dissected free up to the innominate bifurcation. After the heart and lungs are exposed, the donor is anticoagulated with intravenous heparin (300 units per kg). A perfusion cannula is placed in the pulmonary artery at least 1.5 cm distal to the pulmonary valve. A cardioplegia catheter is placed in the ascending aorta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When all teams are ready, a bolus of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprostadil</a>) 500 mcg is administered into the main pulmonary artery. Once the blood pressure starts to decrease, the inferior vena cava is transected; the left atrial appendage vented; and the aorta is cross-clamped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The heart is perfused with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioplegia-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cardioplegia solution</a> and vented through the left atrium. The cold pulmonary flush, low potassium dextran (eg, Perfadex) 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> usually 4 L total at 4&ordm;C, containing an additional 500 mcg of PGE1, is infused through the pulmonary artery while ventilation is continued. It is important to make sure the pulmonary flush solution is infused under gravity drainage no higher than 30 cm above the donor to avoid injury to the pulmonary vasculature (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Steps to optimize lung preservation'</a> below). The cold flush solution is allowed to flow into both pleural cavities to provide the necessary topical cooling of the lungs. Addition of ice slush is not required for the lungs. </p><p>The superior vena cava and azygos vein are transected. The main pulmonary artery is transected at its midpoint, usually at the cannulation site. The aorta is transected. The heart is then attached only by the pulmonary veins. Starting at the right inferior pulmonary vein, and incision is made halfway between the coronary sinus and the right inferior pulmonary vein. Then, under direct visualization from inside the atrium, an atrial cuff encompassing all four pulmonary veins is cut to preserve adequate sewing cuffs for the heart and both lungs. The heart is removed. </p><p>A retrograde flush with 1 L of cold Perfadex is then performed by instilling 250 mL into each pulmonary vein while ventilation is still continued. The proximal trachea just below the larynx is mobilized. The lungs are inflated to a peak pressure of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 50 percent, the trachea is stapled at its proximal end with the lungs at near full inflation (this is a visual judgement to make sure the lungs are not overinflated), with two firings of a TA-30 blue stapler and cut in between, to prevent any airway contamination of the surgical field. Note: A long length of trachea is obtained to facilitate intubation on EVLP if desired. </p><p>The lungs are placed in triple sterile bags with 2 L of cold Perfadex inside and then placed on ice in a cooler for transport. Note that ice is not to be placed in direct contact with the organ. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Donation after cardiac death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A slightly different initial sequence is used for donation after cardiac death (also known as non-heart-beating donation or donation after circulatory determination of death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The first step is systemic heparinization, which is usually given prior to withdrawal of life sustaining therapies, although some centers do not use any heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After reintubation of the donor, a median sternotomy is rapidly performed; the pericardium is opened and the pulmonary artery cannulated (left atrial appendage is transected) and flushed, before any other dissection is performed. After flushing, the procedure follows that for donation after brain death, as described above. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential deceased donor&quot;, section on 'Donation after death determined using circulatory criteria (DCD)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">STEPS TO OPTIMIZE LUNG PRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal lung preservation solution, storage temperature, inflation volume, oxygen concentration, and pharmacologic additives needed to enhance lung graft success continue to be investigated. However, several lung preservation techniques have been developed to protect the procured donor lungs from the major insults (eg, brain death, ischemia, anoxia, extended storage, and reperfusion) that may contribute to primary graft dysfunction and long-term mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-lung-graft-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary lung graft dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Generally, preservation of the procured lungs is initiated with a hypothermic pulmonary artery flush of 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> with a preservative solution, coupled with the topical administration of a cold solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Flushing uniformly cools the lung tissue and removes blood from the pulmonary vascular bed, thereby preventing thrombosis and endothelial injury from retained neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thereafter, the lungs are transported at 4 to 8&ordm;C in a partially inflated state. Specifics of this process are discussed below and are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79611 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Preservation solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experimental work and clinical reports have favored the use of extracellular solutions over intracellular (high potassium, low sodium crystalloid) type preservation solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/11-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-19</a>]. Examples of extracellular solutions include low-potassium dextran (LPD)-glucose solution (eg, Perfadex), developed specifically for lung preservation, and Cambridge solution, Celsior, and Papworth, which are other solutions that are used less commonly. Papworth contains Ringer's lactate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, albumin, and donor blood. Euro-Collins and University of Wisconsin are intracellular solutions that were used historically, with unsuitably high potassium concentrations for the lung. Currently, Perfadex is the preservation solution used in the vast majority of lung transplant programs worldwide.</p><p>The key components of LPD solutions are the dextran and low-potassium concentration. Dextran-40 in the LPD solution functions as an oncotic agent, tending to keep water in the intravascular compartment, and thereby decreasing interstitial edema formation. Dextran-40 also has rheologic properties that reduce the aggregation of erythrocytes and circulating thrombocytes, which may improve the microcirculation and reduce cellular activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The low-potassium concentration maintains normal pulmonary artery pressures during infusion. A further development is the dextran-glucose-based extracellular solution. The addition of glucose is designed to support aerobic metabolism and maintain cell integrity during prolonged ischemia. Perfadex is an LPD-glucose solution that is now available worldwide and is used by most lung transplant centers. The addition of glucose to a lung preservation solution takes advantage of the unique aspect of lung physiology in transplantation; the inflated lung has the ability to supply oxygen to its parenchyma even during storage thus low level aerobic metabolism is supported.</p><p>Several studies have found better post-transplant outcomes (eg, frequency of primary graft dysfunction, duration of ventilator dependence, and 30 day mortality) with individual extracellular solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/13,14,16-18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,16-18,21</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study examined outcomes among 310 consecutive lung transplant recipients whose donor lungs were preserved with Euro-Collins, Papworth, or Perfadex solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lung preservation with Papworth solution was associated with increased mortality compared with the other solutions; preservation with Perfadex was associated with a decreased incidence of primary lung graft dysfunction at 48 hours. Another study retrospectively examined the likelihood of primary lung graft dysfunction among 157 consecutive patients whose donor lungs were preserved with one of three lung preservation solutions (Perfadex, Euro-Collins, and Papworth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Perfadex was superior in preventing moderate to severe grades of primary graft dysfunction, and a trend towards superiority in other early post-transplant outcomes was also noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In a separate retrospective study, LPD (4161 recipients) was compared to University of Wisconsin solution (294 recipients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. LPD was associated with a lower mortality at one year among high risk recipients, but no overall mortality difference was noted between the groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic additives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two pharmacologic agents, prostaglandins and glucocorticoids, have been broadly used for lung preservation. These drugs have been given as pretreatment of the donor before flushing, as part of the flush perfusate itself, and as a treatment for the recipient during and after reperfusion. Other aspects of management of potential lung transplant donors are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-deceased-donor-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Deceased donor evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prostaglandins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprostadil</a>) and I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>, prostacyclin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloprost</a> [a PGI<sub>2</sub> analog]) were originally chosen for lung preservation because their vasodilator activity offset the cold or potassium-induced vasoconstriction of the preservation solution and allowed a more even distribution of perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Subsequent study has found that prostaglandins have additional properties, particularly down regulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression that are probably more important in ameliorating ischemia-reperfusion injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Many centers routinely inject PGE1 into the pulmonary artery just before flushing and also add PGE1 into the preservation solution based on the experimental evidence, although clinical trial data in humans are lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Methylprednisolone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> has become an empirical standard therapy to most clinical protocols because of its broad anti-inflammatory actions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Methylprednisolone, 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> is typically administered intravenously to the donor before procurement and to the recipient immediately before reperfusion. The use of hormonal therapy in deceased donors is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-deceased-organ-donor#H3310044518\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the deceased organ donor&quot;, section on 'Hormonal therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Temperature of preservation solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the optimal temperature has been debated, most centers use a practical and easily achievable flush temperature of 4 to 8&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hypothermia reduces metabolic activity such that cell viability can be preserved in the face of ischemia (5 percent of the metabolic rate at 37&ordm;C). Cold temperature preservation thus continues to be an important component of lung preservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterograde and retrograde flush</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterograde flush refers to the administration of flush solution through the pulmonary artery with drainage from the pulmonary veins. The usual volume is 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. Retrograde flush refers to the administration of the flush solution to each pulmonary vein, usually 250 mL to each vein, with drainage through the pulmonary artery. The combination of both procedures appears to achieve better lung function; most transplant centers combine an anterograde flush followed by a retrograde flush [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In an experimental model, a retrograde flush improved lung preservation, compared with anterograde flush alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This effect was attributed to a more effective clearance of red cells within the capillaries and better distribution of the flush solution. It also provides the added advantage of removing any clot or emboli in the pulmonary arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume of preservation solution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although scientific data are limited regarding the ideal volume of preservation solution, typically about 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of perfusate is infused after lung extraction, as this effectively clears the lungs of blood cells and uniformly cools the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Usually this takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure of preservation solution infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited regarding the optimal pulmonary artery pressure for infusion of the preservation solution. The need for complete clearance of the vascular bed has to be balanced against the risk of injury to the low pressure pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. We typically use a perfusion pressure in the lower range (10 to 15 mmHg) and avoid exceeding a maximum perfusion pressure of 22 mmHg (30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. This is easy to achieve by hanging the flush solution bags at 30 cm above the donor and flushing with gravity perfusion pressure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung inflation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflation of the lungs with an oxygen mixture during the ischemic period appears to protect the lung; however, scientific information regarding ideal oxygen concentration and inflation pressure is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Based on studies in animal models, three primary mechanisms are thought to contribute to the protective effect of inflation with oxygenated air:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efficient aerobic metabolism is maintained</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integrity of pulmonary surfactant is preserved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelial fluid transport is improved</p><p/><p>Lung inflation is generally limited to 50 to 75 percent of the total lung capacity (based on visual assessment) or to an airway pressure of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to avoid over distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Usually, an inspired oxygen tension (FiO<sub>2</sub>) ranging from 30 to 50 percent is used. Once the lungs have been inflated, the trachea is clamped for storage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Storage temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal temperature for donor lung storage remains unclear. Preservation at 4 to 8&ordm;C decreases cellular metabolic activity and preserves the cellular function, however cold storage may compound some aspects of ischemia-reperfusion injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Specifically in the lung, hypothermia may result in increased extravascular fluid and pulmonary vasoconstriction, contributing to diminished oxygen exchange and increased vascular resistance after reperfusion. Some experimental work has suggested that lungs preserved at 10&ordm;C instead of 4&ordm;C had superior lung function after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, the most common temperature for lung storage continues to be 4&ordm;C, as the logistics of transportation may prolong storage time and necessitate the margin of safety provided by the lower temperature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemic time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acceptable limits of ischemic time are not known, although based on animal experiments, the longer the ischemic time, the greater the risk of severe reperfusion injury. Clinically, the underlying state (eg, injury, age) of the donor lung to start with will define what duration of ischemia will be tolerated by that lung. Ischemic times up to eight hours are generally considered acceptable. </p><p>The risks of primary graft dysfunction and 30 day mortality increase with more than eight hours of ischemia; however, ischemic times of up to 12 hours have been successfully reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/6,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,44-46</a>]. Therefore, the decision to accept lungs with longer ischemic times is made with the consideration of the constellation of other predictive risk factors in the lung donor (eg, age, clinical variables, smoking history) and also consideration of the status or condition of the recipient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2332172678\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR AND RECIPIENT SIZE MATCHING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to estimate the size of the donor lung required for the particular recipient. An oversized lung may lead to space compatibility issues and an undersized lung may lead to a more severe reperfusion injury syndrome. </p><p>In general, the total lung capacity (TLC), both ACTUAL (measured) and PREDICTED (calculated using standard equations based on height and sex), of the recipient patient are known. The PREDICTED TLC of the donor lung can be calculated based on the same prediction formulas for height and sex. Thus, the recipient and donor are matched based on the calculated donor TLC that will fit into the chest (donor TLC falls between the actual and predicted recipient TLC volumes). If a significant size mismatch is identified, a planned non-anatomic lung volume reduction or lobar lung transplants can be appropriately anticipated and planned for if needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">NEW APPROACHES TO ORGAN PRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintaining organ viability during preservation is an important prerequisite for successful outcome after transplantation.

However, the need to use suboptimal donor lungs to expand donor lung availability and difficulties assessing lung function in donation after cardiac death have made it necessary to explore alternative preservation techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], such as ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP, also known as ex vivo reconditioning) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-63</a>].</p><p>Normothermic EVLP is being increasingly investigated and applied clinically. EVLP is an important assessment and treatment platform to manage donor lungs and is generally used with a period of protective cold static preservation before and after normothermic EVLP. It is important to note that while continuous normothermic ex vivo perfusion of lungs is effective in rescuing or reassessing organs otherwise not suitable for transplantation, it has not been shown to be safer or superior to cold static preservation for standard criteria donor organs. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Steps to optimize lung preservation'</a> above.)</p><p>An acellular EVLP technique has been developed that can maintain donor lungs for at least 12 hours at body temperature without inducing injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/59,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,63-65</a>]. EVLP also allows evaluation of lung function after ventilation ex vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In normothermic EVLP, the lungs are flushed with cold Perfadex solution for transportation and after arrival at the transplant center placed in an EVLP chamber. Following cannulation of the pulmonary artery and left atrium, anterograde flow is initiated with room temperature perfusate, and the temperature is gradually increased to 37&ordm;C. When 32&ordm;C is reached, ventilation is begun using a tidal volume of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> (ideal donor body weight) at 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min</span>. </p><p>In preliminary studies, the outcomes of EVLP-treated otherwise unacceptable lungs appear similar to conventional donor lungs. In an observational cohort study, 63 recipients of EVLP-treated allografts were compared with 340 recipients of conventionally managed donor allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Allograft survival for EVLP and conventional donor lung recipients was 79 versus 85 percent at one year, 71 versus 73 percent at three years, and 58 versus 57 percent at five years. Freedom from chronic lung allograft dysfunction, lung function test parameters, and acute rejection episodes was similar between the groups.</p><p>Another question is whether EVLP might improve (or worsen) the function of lung allografts that are deemed acceptable. In a randomized, single-center trial, 80 recipient-donor pairs that met standard criteria were assigned to EVLP or standard management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The incidence of primary graft dysfunction &gt;1 was slightly lower in the EVLP group at all time points although the difference did not reach significance (5.7 percent versus 19.5 percent at 24 hours, p = 0.10). The duration of intubation and hospital stay were comparable between the groups, as was the 30 day survival.</p><p>One study demonstrated that a combination of cold static preservation and normothermic EVLP could substantially increase safe preservation time of donor lungs. Patients receiving lungs with more than 12 hours of preservation had similar outcomes compared with patients receiving lungs with a shorter preservation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor lung preservation refers to the process of maintaining a donor lung from the time of procurement until reperfusion in a way that will optimize post transplantation function. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Just prior to procurement, the donor is anticoagulated with heparin and a bolus of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprostadil</a>) is administered into the pulmonary artery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Donor lung procurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During procurement, lungs are flushed with preservation solution at a temperature of 4 to 8&ordm;C and stored at 4 to 8&ordm;C to reduce metabolic activity. An infusion of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of perfusate solution at a pressure 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is sufficient to clear the lungs of blood cells and cool the lungs uniformly. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Steps to optimize lung preservation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PGE1 is also added to the flush solution to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and offset cold-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prostaglandins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid overdistension, lung inflation is generally limited to 50 to 75 percent (visually) of the total lung capacity or to an airway pressure of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. An FiO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 50 percent is used. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Lung inflation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic times of up to eight hours between procurement and re-implantation are generally considered acceptable; historical registry data reflected increased mortality risk with more than eight hours of ischemia. However, successful outcomes have been reported with ischemic times up to 12 hours. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic time'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ex vivo lung perfusion is an emergent and promising technique to increase the number and quality of available allografts. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Normothermic ex vivo perfusion'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-donor-lung-preservation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Puri V, Patterson GA.
