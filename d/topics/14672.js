The goals of treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) are to improve skin manifestations, to alleviate associated systemic symptoms, and to minimize risk for life-threatening systemic complications. Treatment of localized pustular psoriasis is indicated to minimize the development of bothersome or disabling symptoms.</p><p>The treatment of generalized and localized pustular psoriasis will be reviewed here. The clinical features of pustular psoriasis, the management of pustular psoriasis in pregnant women (impetigo herpetiformis), and the management of other forms of psoriasis are reviewed separately.

A preceding history of psoriasis may or may not be present. The acute variant (also known as generalized pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch) is characterized by sudden onset of the pustular eruption accompanied by systemic symptoms of fever and malaise. Laboratory abnormalities, such as leukocytosis, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated liver enzymes are common. In addition, serious complications, including sepsis and hepatic, respiratory, or renal dysfunction can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H86559923\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Generalized pustular psoriasis'</a>.)</p><p>GPP may also present as a less acute disorder in which patients develop widespread annular or figurate erythematous plaques with peripheral pustules and scale (generalized annular pustular psoriasis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Pain and fever may accompany these cutaneous manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H506198852\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>There is no cure for GPP and recurrences are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, long-term treatment often is required to minimize recurrences of disease.</p><p>Increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of GPP associated with <em>IL36RN</em> mutations may lead to new therapeutic options for this form of GPP. (See <a href=\"#H54691300\" class=\"local\">'IL36RN mutations'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H86559776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167785525\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the optimal approach to the treatment of GPP is complicated by the lack of high quality data on the efficacy of treatments for this disease. Data on treatment primarily consists of findings of retrospective studies, case reports, and expert opinion. Interpretation of the available data is further compromised by the lack of a validated grading system for the severity of GPP and the absence of a standardized method of assessing the response to treatment. The approach described in this topic reflects our preferred approach based upon review of the literature and clinical experience; other approaches also may be reasonable. </p><p>Our approach to treatment consists of the following key steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Determine need for hospitalization and supportive care </strong>&ndash; Patients with acute GPP usually appear systemically ill and admission to the hospital often is necessary to ensure adequate supportive care. The decision to hospitalize a patient is made based upon global consideration of the severity of illness, vital sign stability, fluid and electrolyte status, and concern for systemic infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Supportive skin care measures may help to soothe skin symptoms in patients with GPP. Use of moisturizers, wet wraps, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oatmeal baths can be beneficial in patients with this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Identify and discontinue the causative drug (in drug-induced cases) </strong>&ndash; The withdrawal or administration of a variety of drugs has been linked to GPP. Systemic glucocorticoids are commonly cited contributors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In general, a causative agent should be discontinued provided this can be done safely. However, there is insufficient evidence to confirm the best way to discontinue systemic glucocorticoid therapy when GPP is precipitated by systemic glucocorticoid withdrawal. Options include maintaining the glucocorticoid dose until disease control is achieved with other therapies and continuing to taper the systemic glucocorticoid during the initiation of GPP therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H86559840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Precipitating factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initiate treatment to control skin disease </strong>&ndash; Medical treatment options for GPP consist of systemic therapies, topical therapies, and phototherapy. We typically use systemic treatment for the initial management of adults with GPP because phototherapy tends to have a delayed onset of action and topical therapies are impractical for the treatment of widespread disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to limiting factors such as drug availability and patient-specific contraindications, the selection of an initial systemic therapy for GPP is based upon the acuity and severity of disease. Whereas adults with slowly progressing, relatively stable eruptions can be managed with agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, patients with acute, severe disease requiring rapid improvement may benefit from initial treatment with faster acting therapies, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Patients who do not respond well or cannot tolerate these interventions may benefit from other treatments, such as anti-interleukin (IL)-17 agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H90812547\" class=\"local\">'Patients with severe acute disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H167785561\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical therapies, including topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogs, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, primarily serve as adjuncts to systemic therapy in adults with GPP. We typically focus topical therapy on areas of persistent or recalcitrant skin involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Phototherapy is a second-line treatment typically reserved for patients who have already achieved control of acute disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Manage extracutaneous complications </strong>&ndash; Extracutaneous complications such as sepsis or internal organ dysfunction should be managed appropriately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H251419367\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical course'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The approach to treatment reviewed below focuses on nonpregnant adults with GPP. The treatment of pregnant women and children with GPP is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatoses-of-pregnancy#H52\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatoses of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Pustular psoriasis of pregnancy'</a> and <a href=\"#H167785579\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167785531\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our selection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> as first-line therapeutic options for adult-onset GPP is in agreement with a 2012 consensus statement from the task force of the National Psoriasis Foundation Medical Board [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acitretin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> are generally well-tolerated drugs that can be used for long-term treatment. However, as noted above, the time to treatment efficacy for acitretin and methotrexate tends to be longer than for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Thus, for our patients with severe, acute disease that warrants rapid stabilization and improvement, the faster acting drugs infliximab and cyclosporine are our preferred initial agents. Once control of acute disease is achieved, patients may be transitioned to acitretin, methotrexate, or other therapies.</p><p>In addition to rapidity of onset, other patient-specific factors can influence treatment selection. As an example, the requirement that women abstain from pregnancy for three years after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> treatment gives acitretin a relative contraindication for use in women of childbearing age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86907155\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with relatively stable disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acitretin</a> is our treatment of choice for the initial management of adults with relatively stable GPP. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> is an alternative first-line treatment. We also use these drugs for long-term treatment of GPP following control of severe acute disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86907161\"><span class=\"h4\">Oral retinoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral retinoids (etretinate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>) are well-accepted and widely used treatments for GPP. Etretinate was withdrawn from the US market in 1998 and replaced by its metabolite acitretin because of concern about the prolonged elimination half-life life of etretinate. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; Although oral retinoids are considered a standard treatment for GPP, evidence to support their use is limited. Some support for the use of oral retinoids stems from a Japanese study that analyzed treatment data from 385 patients with acute GPP obtained through questionnaire responses from multiple community center hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The study found that among 188 patients treated with retinoids, treatment was reported as effective in 84 percent. Retinoid treatment regimens were not standardized; typically, treatment was with etretinate (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and tapered as tolerated). Many patients received retinoids in combination with other therapies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A separate retrospective study of 63 patients hospitalized at Mayo Clinic-affiliated hospitals between 1961 and 1989 also suggests efficacy of oral retinoid therapy. Good responses were recorded in all of six patients treated with etretinate for acute GPP and both of two patients given the drug for annular pustular psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is some evidence to suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>, which is not considered effective for chronic plaque psoriasis, may be of benefit in GPP. In a series of 11 adults with GPP, isotretinoin therapy seemed beneficial for improving pustule formation in 10 patients, although monotherapy with the drug did not seem to be effective for clearing all lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Isotretinoin also appeared useful in an adolescent female who failed to respond adequately to topical corticosteroids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and in two patients who did not tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acitretin</a> is our preferred oral retinoid for GPP because clinical experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> for this indication is more limited and etretinate is not available in the United States. Our usual starting dose for acitretin is 0.75 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. Japanese authors have suggested an initial dose of etretinate of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Improvement in GPP (ie, cessation of new pustule formation and initial improvement in other clinical signs) is usually noted within 7 to 10 days of oral retinoid therapy. After disease control is achieved, the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> can be tapered slowly to the lowest dose necessary to maintain the response. It is impossible to predict for individual patients but a complete response often requires two to three months to achieve. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of adverse effects of oral retinoids include xerosis, cheilitis, dry mucous membranes, hypertriglyceridemia, hair loss, liver function test abnormalities, bone changes, and visual changes. Oral retinoids are teratogenic and pregnancy should be avoided for three years following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> therapy. Therefore, the drug has a relative contraindication for women of childbearing age. In contrast, pregnancy is contraindicated for only one month following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-isotretinoin-therapy-for-acne-vulgaris#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Isotretinoin safety'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86907167\"><span class=\"h4\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> appears to be effective for GPP and is an alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Data on the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> for GPP are limited. In a multicenter study in Japan in which community hospitals were sent questionnaires about patients with GPP, efficacy of methotrexate was documented for 76 percent of 41 patients given this therapy alone or in conjunction with other therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, in a retrospective study of 63 patients hospitalized for GPP at Mayo Clinic affiliated-hospitals between 1961 and 1989, good responses to methotrexate were reported for three of eight patients with acute GPP and both of two patients with annular pustular psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A typical dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> for adults with GPP is 15 mg per week, with a maximum dose of 25 mg per week. Methotrexate is <strong>not</strong> given daily. Absorption of oral methotrexate may be reduced at higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Thus, when doses higher than 15 mg per week are required, we often use subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Myelosuppression is a potential serious adverse effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> therapy that warrants careful administration of treatment and laboratory follow-up. The amount of methotrexate used for the initial dose varies among experts, with some experts initiating with a small test dose (eg, 5 mg per week) followed by upward titration of the dose and others initiating at higher doses (eg, 15 mg per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When treating older adult patients or patients with renal insufficiency, the initial dose should not exceed 10 mg per week. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> include gastrointestinal distress, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and teratogenicity. Methotrexate should be combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation (eg, 1 mg of folic acid per day) to decrease hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Monitoring protocols for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> treatment vary; in general, a complete blood count with differential and platelets should be performed at baseline and soon after the initiation of methotrexate and following dose increases. While some clinicians perform hematologic testing approximately one week after dose initiation or changes, others (including the author) perform tests after two to four weeks provided the patient is not an older adult individual and does not have renal insufficiency. Hematologic testing is repeated every two to four weeks during the first few months of treatment and is subsequently tapered to every one to three months. Periodic laboratory monitoring of kidney and liver function is also indicated during methotrexate therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86907173\"><span class=\"h4\">Topical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the widespread nature of GPP, topical medications are primarily reserved for adjunctive therapy. Topical therapies that have seemed useful for adjunctive therapy in case reports are similar to those used in chronic plaque psoriasis, and include topical corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], combination therapy with a topical corticosteroid and topical vitamin D analog [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Systemic therapies have included oral retinoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, systemic glucocorticoids, methotrexate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a>, and anakinra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/98,100-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,100-106</a>]. The efficacies of these interventions have not been compared and the best approach to treatment is unclear.</p><p>Our initial choice for treatment of ACH is typically a super-potent topical corticosteroid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=halobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">halobetasol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a>), which we instruct the patient to apply to the affected areas once to twice daily for two to four weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). Preferably, the patient should apply the medication under an occlusive dressing at night, particularly during the first week of therapy. Plastic wrap is commonly used as an occlusive dressing. Alternatively, occlusion can be applied using damp cloth covered by dry cloth. </p><p>If a good response to treatment occurs, the frequency of application can be tapered as tolerated to a frequency as low as once or twice per week. Alternatively, we prescribe a topical vitamin D analog (eg, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> or calcipotriene) in conjunction with the super-potent topical corticosteroid and instruct the patient to apply the topical corticosteroid followed immediately by the vitamin D analog once to twice daily for two to four weeks. Once sufficient improvement is achieved, we taper the topical corticosteroid as tolerated and continue treatment with the vitamin D analog. A commercial product containing both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> dipropionate and calcipotriene is available.</p><p>When patients fail to respond adequately to topical therapy, we proceed to local phototherapy or systemic therapy, although we usually continue to use topical corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Both PUVA photochemotherapy and narrowband UVB have appeared effective for ACH in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pustular-psoriasis-management/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. We often use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) as our first-line systemic treatment, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> as alternatives. If a patient fails to improve with these traditional systemic therapies, we may attempt treatment with a biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>.

The goals of treatment are to improve skin manifestations, alleviate systemic symptoms, and prevent serious or life-threatening complications of this disease. (See <a href=\"#H167786956\" class=\"local\">'Generalized pustular psoriasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for adults with GPP include topical therapies, systemic therapies, and phototherapy. Most patients require systemic therapy. Topical therapies are primarily used as adjuncts to systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H167785525\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As part of the initial management of patients with GPP, the need for hospitalization should be assessed. In addition, the patient&rsquo;s medical history should be reviewed for drugs that may contribute to the development of GPP. (See <a href=\"#H167785525\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to the treatment of GPP is influenced by the acuity and severity of symptoms. For adult patients with relatively stable disease, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> is an alternative first-line treatment. For adult patients with severe acute GPP, we suggest initial therapy with fast-acting therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H167785531\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other therapeutic agents that may be effective in adults with GPP include inhibitors of the Th17 pathway, psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>. Combination therapy with more than one treatment can also be attempted. (See <a href=\"#H167785561\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic glucocorticoids can induce rapid improvement in GPP, but have been identified as potential inciting factors for this disease. We do not usually use systemic glucocorticoids for the treatment of GPP. (See <a href=\"#H167785567\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on the treatment of acute GPP in children are very limited. Options for first-line therapy include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>. Some children with annular pustular psoriasis can be managed with topical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H167785579\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of GPP associated with <em>IL36RN</em> mutations may lead to new therapeutic options for this form of GPP.
