It contains a variety of structures that surround the inguinal and femoral canal. The key landmarks of the inguinal canal include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inguinal ligament </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The internal and external inguinal rings </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spermatic cord in males </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The round ligament in females </p><p/><p>The anatomic region known as Hesselbach&rsquo;s triangle helps differentiate indirect hernias, which pass outside this triangle through the inguinal canal, from direct hernias which protrude into this space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83015 \">figure 2</a>). Hesselbach&rsquo;s triangle is defined laterally by the inferior epigastric artery, medially by the lateral border of the rectus muscle, and inferiorly by the inguinal ligament. The femoral canal contains the femoral artery, nerve, and vein that exit the femoral ring into the proximal thigh.</p><p>Indirect hernias result from two anatomic defects: weakening of the fascia of the transversalis muscle fibers at the internal abdominal ring and the potential space from a persistent processus vaginalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83013 \">figure 3</a>). In males, the obliteration of the processus vaginalis occurs during the first two years of life, but as many as 40 percent remain patent, 20 percent of which will later develop into inguinal hernias. Indirect inguinal hernias in males and females occur more frequently on the right, the side where the migration of the testicle or round ligament occurs last. The female counterpart of the processus vaginalis commonly disappears by eight months of gestation, although patency may persist into childhood. If patency persists, the patent processus is termed the canal of Nuck. Embryology of the testes and ovaries are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Embryology'</a>.)</p><p>Inguinal lymph nodes are important structures adjacent to the inguinal canal that are present in the superficial and deep planes. The medial portion of the superficial nodes drain lymph from the skin in the perineum, gluteal region, and lower abdominal wall as well as the vaginal mucosa, penis, scrotum, and anal canal. The lateral group and the vertical superficial nodes drain the lower back below the iliac crest, the anterior leg, lateral upper leg, and medial foot. The deep inguinal nodes lie beneath the fascia and medial to the femoral vein and drain the superficial nodes in addition to the clitoris, the glans of the penis, and the medial ipsilateral leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7223760\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF INGUINAL SWELLING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of inguinal swelling are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83582\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83582 \">table 1</a>). Pediatric inguinal swelling occurs mostly from inguinal hernias, especially in boys, who are affected six times more often than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, it is important to consider the different features and characteristics of masses in the inguinal or groin area to exclude other causes, such as congenital anomalies, infections, and neoplasms. In most instances careful clinical evaluation with selected use of ultrasonography can rapidly establish the etiology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11662269\"><span class=\"h2\">Inguinal hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inguinal hernias in children may present as intermittent, reducible, or incarcerated inguinal masses. Inguinal hernias may be indirect or direct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83015 \">figure 2</a>) with indirect hernias occurring much more frequently than direct hernias and much more commonly in males than females. (See <a href=\"#H7223753\" class=\"local\">'Inguinal anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Indirect hernias appear when abdominal contents pass lateral to the epigastric artery, through the inguinal canal, and into the scrotum or labia through the external inguinal ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a>). They may contain omentum, bowel, and rarely, the appendix (also called an Amyand hernia). In males, the scrotum is full which helps differentiate inguinal hernias from retractile, ectopic, or undescended testes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83101\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83101 \">picture 1</a>). In females, reproductive organs are often present, including the ovary, fallopian tube, and rarely, the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83100\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83100 \">picture 2</a>). It can be difficult to differentiate a sliding hernia of the ovary from a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck since both can present as non-painful, palpable, movable inguinal masses in females. The ovary, however, can become incarcerated within the canal, presenting as a painful mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Inguinal mass in a female'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis and treatment of inguinal hernias varies by gender and presenting features, and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964165928\"><span class=\"h2\">Femoral hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Femoral hernias are very uncommon. In children, a hernia in the groin area is almost 250 times more likely to be an indirect hernia than a femoral one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Children with femoral hernias have swelling in the upper thigh, below the inguinal ligament and medial to the femoral artery, often in association with crampy abdominal pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83045 \">figure 4</a>). Despite the difference in anatomic location, pediatric femoral hernias can be clinically difficult to distinguish from the inguinal variety and are frequently misdiagnosed preoperatively by surgeons and referring physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Femoral hernias are less likely to be incarcerated than the inguinal variety, but incarcerated femoral hernias are often complicated by sliding ovaries, especially in female infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In adults, femoral hernias are more common in older women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When suspected, prompt surgical consultation is warranted as femoral hernias are more apt to present with strangulation and to require emergency surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37562546\"><span class=\"h2\">Spermatic cord hydrocele</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hydrocele of the spermatic cord occurs when fluid accumulates along the cord in the inguinal canal or upper scrotum, but is separated from the testes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83047 \">figure 5</a>). Whereas an indirect hernia occurs from a failure of the processus vaginalis to close, a cord hydrocele occurs from an abnormal closure of the processus vaginalis where the distal portion closes and midportion remains patent along the cord. Cord hydroceles are much less common than indirect hernias. In a large series of ultrasounds performed to evaluate for inguinal masses or swelling, a cord hydrocele was present in only 1.5 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Although mixed forms have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], cord hydroceles are typically classified into one of two types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Non-communicating (encysted)</strong> &ndash; This is the<strong> </strong>most common variety and is characterized by fluid pooling along the length of the cord but not communicating with the peritoneal cavity or tunica vaginalis. Since the encysted type does not communicate with the peritoneal cavity, the size does not change with increases in intra-abdominal pressure, such as crying fits or coughing, nor is this type reducible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Communicating (funicular)</strong> &ndash; Unlike the encysted type, the funicular type communicates freely with the peritoneal cavity at the internal ring. Therefore, the swelling in the inguinal area can enlarge with increased intra-abdominal pressure, and can decrease in size when the patient relaxes. Communicating cord hydroceles can be difficult to distinguish from indirect inguinal hernias on physical examination, and ultrasound is frequently required to establish the diagnosis.</p><p/><p>Regardless of type, children with spermatic cord hydroceles warrant referral to a surgeon with pediatric and genitourinary expertise. Herniotomy is frequently performed to prevent later development of an indirect inguinal hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2467130\"><span class=\"h2\">Inguinal lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphadenopathy is characterized by non-tender swelling or enlargement of the lymph nodes. Lymph node swelling can occur secondary to a generalized or localized process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-etiology#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Localized lymphadenopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-etiology#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Generalized lymphadenopathy'</a>.)</p><p>Although inguinal adenopathy may arise adjacent to the inguinal canal, it can be differentiated from an indirect inguinal hernia because of the characteristic rubbery and limited movement of the swelling and its location outside of the inguinal canal. In addition, the enlarged lymph node will produce a mass that does not extend into the scrotum or labia. Direct and femoral hernias may be confused with lymphadenopathy because the bulge is either above (direct) or below (femoral) the inguinal canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83015\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83015 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83045 \">figure 4</a>) and the swelling does not extend into the genitalia. However, unless incarcerated, these hernias will have a cystic quality on palpation. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalized lymphadenopathy with inguinal involvement</strong> can be associated with infectious disease (HIV, EBV, miliary tuberculosis, etc), metabolic disease (Gaucher, Niemann-Pick, etc), rheumatologic disease (eg, JIA, SLE, etc), immunologic disease (eg, chronic granulomatous disease, serum-like sickness reaction, etc), malignancy (eg, leukemia, lymphoma, etc), inflammatory disease (eg, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Churg-Strauss], etc), lymphoproliferative disease (eg, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Castleman&rsquo;s disease) or medication reaction.

Localized infections causing inguinal lymphadenopathy can include fungal disease (eg, tinea corporis), parasitic disease (eg, filariasis, etc), bacterial skin disease (eg, furuncle, cellulitis, impetigo), and venereal disease (eg, herpes simplex, primary syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-lymphadenopathy-in-children-etiology#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Etiology&quot;, section on 'Inguinal'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2467137\"><span class=\"h2\">Inguinal lymphadenitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphadenitis can be differentiated from lymphadenopathy by the presence of tenderness, often accompanied by erythema and fluctuance.<strong> </strong>Tender lymph nodes in the groin (or axilla) are sometimes termed &ldquo;buboes&rdquo;, derived from the exudative lymph nodes characteristic of bubonic plague. The term is now used to describe the tender and swollen lymph nodes associated with local skin infections or ulcerative lymphadenitis caused by venereal diseases, often in conjunction with genital ulcerative lesions. If secondary swelling from the lymphadenitis involves the genitalia, differentiating this condition from an incarcerated inguinal hernia may be difficult, especially when pain limits the inguinal examination. In these instances, ultrasonography can be diagnostic. </p><p>Inguinal lymphadenitis can be divided into the following categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Animal and tick vectors</strong> &ndash; Infections spread by animal or tick-borne transmission to the lower extremity can cause a regional lymphadenitis from draining lymph proximal to the area of entry. These infections can cause lymphadenopathy, but typically the nodes are tender. Examples of these diseases include: tularemia, plague, brucellosis, and cat-scratch disease.

Pseudo-buboes may feel like swollen or obstructed lymph nodes but are caused by subcutaneous granulation and are eventually broken down and replaced by ulcers. There are several types of ulcers, but the ulcero-vegetative variety is most common and is characterized by a beefy-red non-tender ulcer that bleeds readily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83016\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83016 \">picture 5</a>).

The testes can move up into the inguinal canal as a result of an exaggerated cremasteric reflex. The retractile testis can be &ldquo;milked&rdquo; back into the scrotum by gently applying downward pressure across the top of the palpable mass. Testicular retraction can recur, and no treatment is necessary if the testis is freely movable. However, these patients warrant referral to an urologist for follow-up because approximately one-third of retractile testicles can become undescended with time. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ectopic or undescended testes</strong> &ndash; An ectopic testis is characterized by a testis that naturally descends through the external ring, but then becomes lodged outside of the natural path, most commonly in a superficial pouch near the external ring or less commonly in the suprapubic region, femoral canal, perineum, or contralateral scrotal compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74686\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74686 \">figure 6</a>). Undescended testes can be one-sided (70 percent) or bilateral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51355\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51355 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89318 \">picture 7</a>) (30 percent) and may present as a mass in the inguinal canal. Undescended testicles are associated with an underdeveloped scrotum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-management#H169927\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a>.) </p><p/><p>The goal of the genital examination is to determine if a suspected testicular mass in the inguinal canal of a patient without significant blunt scrotal trauma is a retractile, ectopic, or undescended testis. If the testicular mass cannot be moved into the scrotum, and the hemi-scrotum is empty, then an ectopic or undescended testis is suggested. An undescended testis can lodge anywhere along its line of descent, including the inguinal canal, the external inguinal ring, or intra-abdominally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89319 \">picture 8</a>). While an intra-abdominal testis will not be palpable, remnants of the gubernaculum or dissociated epididymis and vas deferens may be present in the inguinal canal. If the testicular mass is tender or causes pain, this suggests a torsion of an undescended or ectopic testis, sometimes referred to as a cryptorchid testicular torsion.

With significant force to the pelvis, the testes can become displaced, often into a superficial pouch anterior to the external oblique aponeurosis, and rarely into the penile, pubic, canalicular, or perineal areas. </p><p>Clinical findings typically consist of a unilateral tender mass present in the inguinal area in association with an empty hemiscrotum in a patient without a prior history of cryptorchidism or orchiectomy. Rarely, bilateral dislocations may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A traumatic testicular dislocation can be difficult to recognize on initial examination, especially when associated with swelling, ecchymosis, obesity, and pelvic injury. As an example, in an observational study of 1967 abdominal blunt trauma patients over a 15 year period, nine testicular dislocations were reported and all were missed on initial evaluation.

The use of POCUS is limited by the expertise required to both acquire and interpret the images. Use of POCUS should therefore be restricted to trained and experienced providers and should not replace traditional ultrasonography to confirm findings when appropriate. Because the minority of cases of painless inguinal swelling require emergency surgical correction, POCUS may be a reasonable option to expedite emergency department care or to guide coordinated outpatient care when traditional US evaluation may be unnecessary or not readily available. More research is needed to evaluate the impact of POCUS on efficacy, medical decision making, and potential cost savings in children with inguinal swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography (CT)</strong> &ndash; CT is typically <strong>not</strong> necessary but may offer some utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma with testicular dislocation or when evaluating inguinal masses suspicious of malignancy, both for staging and to help better define the mass and it&rsquo;s tissue of origin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7223842\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to inguinal swelling differs in boys versus girls. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2469141\"><span class=\"h2\">Male</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to inguinal swelling starts with recognizing the potentially emergent conditions that require acute management or immediate intervention, which are always signified by the presence of pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83583\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83583 \">algorithm 1</a>). In boys, a painful inguinal lump may indicate an incarcerated or strangulated indirect inguinal hernia, lymphadenitis, torsion of an undescended testis, or when occurring after major genitourinary trauma, a testicular dislocation. An incarcerated or strangulated femoral hernia is identified by a painful lump that is located below the inguinal ligament in the mid- or upper- thigh.

An incarcerated or strangulated femoral hernia is identified by a painful lump that is located below the inguinal ligament in the mid- or upper- thigh. Other differentiating features include the presence of fever, erythema, or induration which suggests localized cellulitis with lymphadenitis. (See <a href=\"#H7223788\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p>Because incarcerated or strangulated indirect inguinal hernias in girls frequently contain reproductive organs (eg, ovary or fallopian tube), the clinician should attempt a gentle reduction and then obtain an US if not successful. If the US shows that reproductive organs are not present, then further efforts at reduction are appropriate. Prompt surgical consultation is warranted for symptomatic girls with entrapped hernias that cannot be reduced. (See <a href=\"#H7223788\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7223833\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p>Infant females in particular, may have herniated reproductive organs that are <strong>not</strong> incarcerated or strangulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-inguinal-swelling-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This is characterized by a palpable, often pearly, movable mass in an asymptomatic female infant. Gentle reduction in these patients will not be successful and further delineation by ultrasound followed by elective referral to a surgeon with pediatric expertise is warranted. </p><p>Other causes of non-painful inguinal swelling in girls include reducible inguinal hernias, lymphadenopathy, or soft tissue tumors. As in boys, a reducible inguinal hernia should be referred for elective repair. Additional evaluation of lymphadenopathy depends upon the degree of illness in the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106348 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106345\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106345 \">table 3</a>), the presence of genital ulcers, or clinical suspicion for malignancy.
