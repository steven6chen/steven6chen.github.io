It may be made difficult by the asthma-exacerbating effect of some antihypertensives. As an example, beta blockers should be used with great caution or not at all in patients with chronic asthma (but not COPD) or acute allergic or exercise-induced bronchospasm. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, among the most widely used antihypertensive drugs, can induce a bothersome cough that, although not damaging to the lungs, often can be confused with cough due to such underlying pulmonary diseases such as asthma and COPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BETA BLOCKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with asthma, beta blockers can cause increased bronchial obstruction and airway reactivity, as well as resistance to the effects of inhaled or oral beta receptor agonists (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Even topical ophthalmic administration of nonselective beta blockers for the treatment of glaucoma has led to asthmatic exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, beta blockers appear to be safe in patients with COPD and indeed may reduce mortality and exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The acute clinical effects of beta-1-selective beta blockers and nonselective beta blockers on pulmonary function in patients with asthma were examined in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 32 randomized trials including 1367 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-1-selective beta blockers significantly reduced forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) by 7 percent and attenuated the bronchodilator response to inhaled beta-2-selective agonists by 10 percent. In addition, one in eight patients had a 20 percent or greater decrease in FEV1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonselective beta blockers had more profound effects on pulmonary function: FEV1 was significantly reduced by 10 percent, and the bronchodilator response to inhaled beta-2-selective was reduced by 20 percent.</p><p/><p>This meta-analysis suggests that even beta-1-selective antihypertensive agents should be used with caution in patients with asthma, especially in those with severe obstruction or markedly reduced pulmonary function at baseline.</p><p>The precise mechanism of beta blocker-induced bronchoconstriction is unknown. Parasympathetic pathways of airway control may be involved since the anticholinergic drug oxitropium bromide can inhibit the effect of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACE INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effect of therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is cough, which develops in 3 to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The cough is typically described as dry, irritative, and persistent but rarely productive. The possibility that this cough may represent an asthma equivalent has been suggested by the demonstration of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in some affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but this has not been a consistent finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There are also conflicting data on whether patients with underlying asthma are more likely than non-asthmatics to develop cough after ACE inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers&quot;, section on 'Cough'</a>.)</p><p>One study of adverse respiratory reactions to ACE inhibitors found that reactions diagnosed as asthma, bronchospasm, or dyspnea were reported with one-tenth the frequency of cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although exacerbation of airflow obstruction has not been a significant problem in asthmatic patients, several cases of worsening asthma have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>At present, ACE inhibitors are currently not first-line therapy in patients with asthma or COPD. However, these agents are <strong>not</strong> contraindicated in these disorders as long as the clinician is aware of the relatively uncommon complication of worsening airflow obstruction. An alternative, when it is desirable to block the renin-angiotensin system, is administration of an angiotensin II receptor blocker.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTOR BLOCKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin II receptor blockers do not appear to induce cough. Furthermore, among patients with symptomatic asthma, one study found no increase in cough or bronchial hyperreactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The authors concluded that these drugs may have a safety profile in asthmatics similar to calcium channel blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIURETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretics can be effectively used in asthmatics, but the potential for serious hypokalemia must be recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This problem is related to the ability of inhaled beta-2 receptor agonists to drive potassium into the cells (acutely lowering the plasma potassium concentration by as much as 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and of oral corticosteroids to mildly enhance urinary potassium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H17666854\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Elevated beta-adrenergic activity'</a>.)</p><p>There is a second potential problem with diuretic therapy in patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnia. In this setting, diuretic-induced metabolic alkalosis can suppress the ventilatory drive, potentially exacerbating the degree of hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Thus, it is safest to administer only low thiazide doses (12.5 to 25 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>) to nonedematous hypertensive patients with asthma or COPD. Low-dose therapy may be both effective and less likely to produce unwanted side effects such as hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

In addition to effectively lowering the blood pressure, they also have the theoretical advantages of opposing muscle contraction in tracheobronchial smooth muscle, inhibiting mast cell degranulation, and possibly reinforcing the bronchodilator effect of beta agonists. Nifedipine, for example, can antagonize the bronchoconstricting effects of antigen, histamine, or cold air challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], although most studies have shown no significant clinical benefit of calcium antagonists in asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>When examined in clinical trials, these agents have been shown to modestly improve or not affect pulmonary function in asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-asthma-and-copd/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. Thus, the use of a low-dose thiazide alone or with a calcium channel blocker represents the preferred regimen for the initial management of the hypertensive asthmatic.
