The incidence of skull fractures in children who present for outpatient evaluation of head trauma ranges from 2 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The parietal bone is involved most frequently, followed by the occipital, frontal, and temporal bones. Linear fractures are most common, followed by depressed and basilar fractures.</p><p>The causes of skull fracture and the causes of head injury typically are not separated in the literature except for infants, who are at increased risk of skull fractures from minor mechanisms of trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The major causes of head injuries in children are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls &ndash; 35 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recreational activities &ndash; 29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor vehicle crashes &ndash; 24 percent</p><p/><p>Falls are a common cause of head injury in children younger than two years of age, whereas motor vehicle crashes and assault are more common in 4- to 17-year-olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Boys are more likely to sustain traumatic head injuries than are girls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-falls-in-children#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of falls in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Intentional injury is an important cause of skull fractures, particularly in young children. One retrospective study reviewed the medical records of 287 children (aged one week to 6.5 years) who were admitted to a metropolitan children's hospital with head injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Intentional injuries accounted for 19 percent. The mean age was 0.7 years for the intentional injury group versus 2.5 years for the unintentional group. Subdural hematoma; subarachnoid hemorrhage; retinal hemorrhages; and associated cutaneous, skeletal, and visceral injuries are more common in intentional than unintentional head injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location and pattern of a skull fracture depends upon the nature and site of the causative impact. Fractures may involve the flat bones (eg, frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital) or the base of the skull. Fractures are classified according to their appearance, location, degree of depression, and whether they are in communication with the air sinuses of the skull which increases the risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Linear fractures account for approximately 75 percent of skull fractures in children. They are single or multiple fracture lines that involve the thickness of the skull and may disrupt underlying vascular structures. They start at the point of maximum impact and spread but do not cross suture lines. Multiple linear fractures indicate multiple sites of impact or repetitive injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Comminuted</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comminuted skull fractures consist of multiple associated linear fractures. They usually result from larger forces of impact than do single linear fractures. Stellate or comminuted fractures of the occipital bone often result from repeated blows against an object, and may suggest child abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Depressed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depressed skull fractures are the result of significant force and frequently are associated with underlying cerebral injury. They may result from blows over small areas (eg, from a hammer or heel of a shoe). The depressed bone can lacerate the underlying dura or penetrate the brain tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Depressed skull fractures increase the likelihood of posttraumatic seizures and infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Open</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open skull fractures are skull fractures that permit communication between the skull and the outside of the scalp or mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract. Open fractures increase the risk of central nervous system infection. The two types of open skull fractures are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skull fractures that have an overlying laceration, also called compound fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skull fractures that disrupt the paranasal sinuses or middle ear and may be associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea or otorrhea. The evaluation of suspected CSF rhinorrhea is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nasal trauma and fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a skull fracture usually is suggested by the history and physical examination. The history may include penetrating trauma, intentional injury, or injury associated with loss of consciousness. The older child may complain of localized pain and swelling. The physical examination can include soft-tissue swelling, hematoma, palpable fracture or skull defect, crepitus, or signs of basilar skull fracture. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Basilar skull fracture'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with skull fractures are at risk for traumatic brain injury (TBI) with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and concussion. Thus, they warrant careful neurologic assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Secondary survey'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear skull fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Linear fractures occur most frequently in the parietal bone but can occur in any bone of the calvarium. Of linear skull fractures, 15 to 30 percent are associated with TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most linear skull fractures have associated physical examination findings, including overlying hematoma or soft tissue swelling; the soft-tissue swelling may not be present immediately after the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Scalp hematomas are predictive of skull fractures in infants younger than one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>]. In one prospective study of 422 asymptomatic infants with head injury, hematomas of the parietal or temporal regions increased the likelihood of underlying skull fracture, whereas hematomas of the frontal region did not (odds ratio: 38, 16, and 0.6 for parietal, temporal, and frontal hematoma, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, a stepwise relationship was noted between the size of the hematoma and the likelihood of skull fracture (odds ratio: 27, 5.5, and 3, for large, moderate, and small hematomas, respectively). However, most children with isolated scalp hematomas and no other clinical symptoms do <strong>not</strong> have a clinically important traumatic brain injury.

Approximately 30 percent of children with depressed skull fractures have associated TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. The risks of dural tear and brain laceration increase with the depth of the depression. In addition to intracranial hemorrhage, complications of depressed skull fractures include compression of underlying brain parenchyma, intraparenchymal bone fragments, cerebrospinal fluid leak, growing skull fracture, and cosmetic deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Basilar skull fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basilar skull fractures involve the base of the skull. In children, they are associated with significant adverse outcomes. As an example, in an observational study of over 550 children with basilar skull fractures determined during emergency department evaluation for head injury, 14 percent were intubated for &gt;24 hours, 13 percent underwent neurosurgery, and 6 percent died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Enlargement is caused by herniated brain, a leptomeningeal cyst, or dilated ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These fractures commonly are called growing skull fractures, traumatic encephaloceles, or leptomeningeal cysts. Neurologic findings or cranial growth asymmetry may be present if associated compression of the underlying brain is present.</p><p>The incidence of growing fractures is not known. In one study of 592 children with head injuries, the prevalence was 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Growing skull fractures occur predominantly in children who are younger than three years of age and in whom the diastasis is greater than 3 to 4 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. They usually are detected within one year of an acute head injury as a localized swelling or palpable skull defect that increases in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. However, they may go undetected for years and present with delayed onset of neurologic symptoms (headache, seizure, or neurologic deficit) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND RADIOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skull fractures should be suspected in patients with the following findings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized tenderness and swelling of the frontal bone or scalp, especially if associated with a palpable fracture, skull defect, or crepitus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of basilar skull fracture:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood behind the tympanic membrane (hemotympanum) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62387\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62387 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subcutaneous bleeding around the orbit (raccoon eyes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69662\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69662 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subcutaneous bleeding over the mastoid process (Battle sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69660 \">picture 3</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid leak from the ear (CSF otorrhea)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid leak from the nose (CSF rhinorrhea)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cranial nerve deficits leading to facial paralysis, anosmia, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, nystagmus, tinnitus, or hearing loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered mental status after a head injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penetrating head injury</p><p/><p>Imaging establishes the diagnosis of a skull fracture. Modalities for radiologic evaluation of children with suspected skull fractures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuroimaging</strong> &ndash; When skull fracture is suggested by clinical findings in children with acute head injury, we recommend unenhanced computed tomography (CT) to provide rapid diagnostic confirmation. Three dimensional reconstruction images increase the sensitivity of CT for detecting skull fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Temporal bone CT without contrast, including fine cuts in the axial and coronal planes are indicated in children with signs of basilar skull fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neuroimaging-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neuroimaging in children&quot;, section on 'CT applications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Head CT is preferred over simple radiography because it can identify both skull fractures and TBI. Although ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown potential for detecting skull fractures and TBI without radiation, it is not widely available, is currently less sensitive for detecting bone fracture, and is more costly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other clinical criteria for determining which children with minor head injury should undergo head CT is discussed separately. The threshold for obtaining a CT scan in infants younger than two years, particularly those younger than three months, should be lower than it is for older children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H1237555\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skull radiographs</strong> &ndash; Skull radiographs can be used to identify and classify skull fractures. However, computed tomography of the head, either standard or three dimensional projections, are more accurate for diagnosing pediatric skull fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Furthermore, the absence of a fracture does not reliably exclude TBI. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 16 studies to evaluate variables that predict significant TBI in children with minor head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although presence of a skull fracture was a good predictor of TBI, (RR 6.1, 95% CI 3.4-11.2), it was neither sensitive (59 percent) nor specific (88 percent) enough to perform well as a diagnostic test. Thus, plain radiographs should <strong>not</strong> be used as a screening test to determine whether a child with known head trauma should undergo CT to identify TBI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Skull radiographs may be performed when the history of trauma is uncertain (eg, evaluation of suspected abuse), or to rule out the presence of a superficial foreign body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, they should only be performed when interpretation by a pediatric radiologist or specialist with similar expertise (eg, pediatric neurosurgeon) is available. Interpretation by other physicians is likely to have poor sensitivity and specificity. As an example, when reading skull radiographs of children younger than two years of age, pediatric emergency physicians identified skull fractures with a sensitivity of 76 percent and a specificity of 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If plain radiographs identify a skull fracture, neuroimaging (CT or MRI) is warranted although the risk for serious intracranial injury in well-appearing children with a nondepressed frontal skull fracture appears to be low. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> &ndash; Preliminary observational studies suggest that bedside ultrasonography can detect skull fractures but reported sensitivity and specificity are not sufficient to replace CT as the diagnostic test of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. As an example, in a case series of 69 children with head injury warranting CT who also had point of care ultrasonography, ultrasound detected skull fractures with a sensitivity of 88 percent and specificity of 97 percent when performed by clinicians who received a one hour focused training session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
