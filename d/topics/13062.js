Thyroid failure is seen in up to 10 percent of the population, and its prevalence increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is characterized clinically by gradual thyroid failure, with or without goiter formation, due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland involving apoptosis of thyroid epithelial cells. Nearly all patients have high serum concentrations of antibodies against one or more thyroid antigens; diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid, which includes predominantly thyroid-specific B and T cells; and follicular destruction, which is the characteristic hallmark of thyroiditis.</p><p>The cause of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is thought to be a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. The familial association with Graves' disease and the fact that Graves' disease may sometimes evolve into Hashimoto's thyroiditis (and vice versa) indicate that the two disorders are closely related pathophysiologically, albeit not functionally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The pathogenesis and precipitating factors for Hashimoto's thyroiditis are discussed here. The treatment of hypothyroidism and the pathogenesis of Graves' disease are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The name Hashimoto's thyroiditis is derived from the 1912 pathology report by Hashimoto describing patients with goiter and intense lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid as &quot;struma lymphomatosa&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57542 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some clinicians reserve this term only for patients with hypothyroidism. However, many patients do not have hypothyroidism, and others have no goiter or even have an atrophic thyroid gland. These are considered manifestations of the same disease with differing clinical phenotypes. The presence of serum thyroid autoantibodies may be sufficient evidence for Hashimoto's disease. This logic is based upon the observation that thyroid antibodies correlate well with the presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate in the thyroid gland at autopsy examination of individuals with no history of thyroid failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Hence, the two extreme forms of the disorder are goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis and atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis, with the common pathologic feature being lymphocytic infiltration and the common serological feature being the presence of high serum concentrations of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg). Given the pathogenetic and pathologic similarities, we use the term Hashimoto's thyroiditis for all forms of chronic autoimmune (lymphocytic) thyroiditis. Although the thyroid enlargement that can occur is usually asymptomatic, rare patients have thyroid pain and tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], particularly if there is rapid thyroid swelling, and such patients may even require surgical relief.</p><p>Hashimoto's thyroiditis is primarily a disease of women, with a sex ratio of approximately 7:1; it can also occur in children (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence&quot;</a>). Variant mild forms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis have been given names such as silent (or painless) thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, both of which are transient but may be followed years later by thyroid failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=painless-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Painless thyroiditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While hypothyroidism is the characteristic functional abnormality, the inflammatory process early in the course may involve enough apoptosis to cause thyroid follicular disruption and thyroid hormone release, causing transient hyperthyroidism sometimes referred to as Hashitoxicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Some of these patients have a transiently increased radioiodine uptake, and rare patients may cycle between hypothyroidism and Graves' disease, perhaps secondary to alternating production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor blocking and stimulating antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antibodies to the TSH receptor'</a> below.)</p><p>The usual course of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is gradual loss of thyroid function. Among patients with this disorder who have mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism, exhibited as slight increases in TSH and the presence of thyroid antibodies, overt hypothyroidism occurs at a rate of approximately 5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Overt hypothyroidism, once present, is permanent in nearly all cases, except in some children and postpartum women in whom it is often transient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRATHYROIDAL LYMPHOCYTIC INFILTRATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic histopathological abnormalities are profuse lymphocytic infiltration, lymphoid germinal centers, and destruction of thyroid follicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57542\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57542 \">picture 1</a>). Fibrosis and areas of follicular cell hyperplasia, presumably induced by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), are also seen in patients with severe disease and the fibroblast reaction may become excessive as seen in Reidel's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The intrathyroidal lymphocytes are both T and B lymphocytes. T cells and plasma cells may be seen between the follicular cells within a thyroid follicle, a phenomenon called &quot;peripolesis.&quot; There has been recent insight into the development of intrathyroidal germinal centers and lymph vessels suggesting the importance of local chemokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID ANTIGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several antibodies and antigen-specific T cells directed against thyroid antigens have been described in chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. The major antigens are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroglobulin (Tg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid peroxidase (TPO, historically known as the &quot;microsomal&quot; antigen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tg is synthesized by follicular cells and secreted into the lumen of the thyroid follicle, where it is stored as colloid. TPO catalyzes the iodination of tyrosine residues of Tg to form monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76931 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;</a>). The induction of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis in mice using either Tg or TPO as antigen provides evidence for their potential role in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The <em>TG</em> gene may be a susceptibility gene for autoimmune thyroid disease coding for Tg variants of different immunogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>When stimulated by TSH, the thyroid follicular cells take up Tg from the colloid. The Tg is then cleaved by peptidases yielding thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which are released into the extracellular fluid. Some Tg is detectable in the serum of normal subjects, and the concentration may be increased in patients with any thyroid disease.</p><p>Tg is a large glycoprotein dimer, each subunit being approximately 330 kD. Approximately 45 of its 72 tyrosine residues can be iodinated in vitro, but only a few are primary iodine acceptors in vivo. These few are located in defined amino acid sequences near the amino and carboxyl terminals of the Tg molecule. Both the extent of iodination and posttranslational modifications of Tg are probably important determinants of its immunogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>TPO is a key enzyme in thyroid hormonogenesis. It is located on the luminal surface of the microvilli of thyroid epithelial cells. The gene for human TPO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] codes for an enzyme that is a 107 kD glycoprotein (933 amino acids) with 10 percent carbohydrate and a membrane-spanning region close to the carboxy-terminus. TPO catalyzes both tyrosine iodination and coupling of iodotyrosyl residues to form T3 and T4. Polymorphisms in the <em>TPO</em> gene have been associated with TPO antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] but have not been directly associated with clinical Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">The TSH receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor contains 764 amino acids and is a G-protein-coupled receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The first 415 amino acids define a large extracellular domain, encoded by 10 exons. The remaining 349 amino acids constitute the seven transmembrane segments, the intracytoplasmic segments between them, and the intracytoplasmic tail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72949\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72949 \">figure 2</a>). TSH binds to multiple sites in the extracellular domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Antibodies to the TSH receptor may be found in a small number of Hashimoto's patients (approximately 15 percent) and may be of the blocking or stimulating variety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>TSH receptor mRNA has also been detected in other tissues (eg, fibroblasts, adipocytes, cardiac muscle cells, pituitary cells, bone cells, and brain). Although the role of the receptor in many of these tissues is unclear, data suggest that TSH can modulate bone cell and adipocyte function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The retroocular expression of the TSH receptor has been implicated in Graves' ophthalmopathy and dermopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF B CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B cells from thyroid tissue of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are activated, as indicated by their ability to secrete thyroid antibodies spontaneously in vitro. Thus, the thyroid gland is a major site of thyroid antibody secretion. Additional evidence for this is the decline in serum thyroid antibody concentrations that occurs after surgery and during administration of antithyroid drugs to patients with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There is also evidence that extrathyroidal lymphoid tissues may contribute to antibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibodies to Tg and TPO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis have high serum concentrations of antibodies to thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). These antibodies are also found, although usually in lower concentration, in patients with other thyroid diseases including Graves' disease and in many subjects with no clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid dysfunction but who presumably have a mild thyroiditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76522\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76522 \">table 1</a>). On average, up to 20 percent of all women may have such antibodies depending on the different assays reported. The antibodies are polyclonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and are usually immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) or IgG3 antibodies, but may be of any subclass and, therefore, their ability to fix complement (primarily IgG1 and IgG3) and pass through the placenta varies. Some Tg and TPO antibodies can lyse thyroid cells in vitro, and some TPO antibodies may inhibit TPO enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], although such observations are in dispute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The polyclonality of these autoantibodies is strong evidence that they are a secondary phenomenon to the thyroid damage inflicted initially by T cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibodies to the TSH receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies of the stimulating variety were first identified by their prolonged thyroid-stimulating activity when serum from patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism was injected into animals; this activity was originally called the long-acting thyroid stimulator (LATS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Subsequently, IgG fractions of serum from these patients were found to have thyroid-stimulating actions qualitatively similar to those of TSH in many bioassays and to block binding of radiolabeled TSH to thyroid membranes; in other words, the IgG fraction contained TSH receptor antibodies that acted as TSH agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Later, with the use of TSH binding competition assays, TSH receptor antibodies were detected in the serum of some patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. However, these antibodies, which are also usually polyclonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], block the action of TSH rather than activating thyroid tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69820\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69820 \">figure 3</a>). Stimulating and TSH-blocking antibodies bind to the leucine-rich repeat region of the extracellular domain of the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Blocking-type TSH receptor antibodies, as well as autoantibodies to TPO and Tg, are sometimes found in patients with overt and subclinical autoimmune thyroiditis, most commonly of the atrophic variety. As noted above, patients who had both Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' hyperthyroidism at different times have also been described; at the appropriate times, their serum contained a predominance of TSH receptor-blocking antibodies or TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. Both types of antibodies may cross the placenta and influence thyroid function. Studies suggest that Hashimoto's patients may also have TSH receptor antibodies of the stimulating variety but which are unable to stimulate much thyroid hormone synthesis because of the thyroid cell destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Function of thyroid antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies have the potential to fix complement if they are of the appropriate IgG subclass. As a result, complement-dependent antibody-mediated cytotoxicity may contribute to thyroid damage in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], but the importance of this action, in comparison with T cell- and cytokine-mediated apoptosis, is most likely only minor. More important is the potential role of thyroid antibody-secreting B cells in presenting attached thyroid antigen to the T cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">THE ROLE OF T CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T cells in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis react with processed thyroid antigens and peptides derived from these antigens. These activated T cells secrete cytokines which themselves activate a variety of other immune cells. T cells have three roles in this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibody production (a Th2 type of function [see below])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apoptotic destruction of thyroid cells by activating cytotoxic T cells (a Th1 function) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53741\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53741 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of the local immune response </p><p/><p>The Th1 CD4+ lymphocytes, when stimulated by antigen, secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-beta.

A T cell clone that caused cytolysis of autologous thyroid cells has been reported in a patient with Hashimoto's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

The V, D, and J genes code for the site on the receptor that recognizes a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, affording antigen specificity. In addition to the many V (&gt;100) and J (&gt;50) genes present in the genome, random nucleotide additions and deletions to the D region add immense complexity to the receptor repertoire, causing this region, referred to as the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3), to be the major locus of antigen recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Although some patients display a restricted (oligoclonal) T cell repertoire, many different V genes coding for the T cell antigen receptor are usually present in T cells from the thyroid and peripheral blood of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69608 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This finding suggests that many antigenic epitopes are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease by the time the patient's pathologic material is available for examination. In contrast, the number of V genes coding for T cell antigen receptors in T cells from patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism is usually much more limited.

Immune suppression can be exerted in a variety of other ways including the direct effects of cytokines and the influence of &quot;anergized&quot; T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

These include the current major hypotheses for all autoimmune diseases: molecular mimicry and bystander activation including the involvement of thyroid cell expression of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and activation of thyroid cell apoptosis by a Fas ligand-Fas interaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54613\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54613 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mimicry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to this proposal, Hashimoto's disease is caused by the immune response to a foreign antigen such as a virus that is structurally similar to an endogenous substance. As an example, both bacteria and humans have heat shock proteins. During the course of a bacterial infection, the host has an antibody and T cell response to the microbe's heat shock protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. These antibodies and T cells may then cross-react with the host's heat shock protein. If the mimicked protein were a thyroid antigen on the thyroid, thyroiditis could ensue.

Expression of these molecules on thyroid follicular cells can be induced by interferon gamma and other products of T cells, when the T cells are activated (eg, by a viral infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]; expression can also be induced by viruses directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

Normal thyroid epithelial cells express a variety of death receptors, including Fas. Activation of the Fas ligand-Fas signaling system could contribute to the follicular cell destruction characteristic of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid follicular cells are induced to express functional Fas and also Fas ligand by cytokine stimulation from antigen-presenting cells and Th1 cells (eg, interleukin-1 [IL-1]). This may cause self-apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In one study, for example, apoptosis occurred in thyroid cells from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis expressing Fas or normal thyroid cells in which Fas was induced by IL-1b, after the cells were exposed to other thyroid cells constitutively expressing Fas ligand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Thus, any event that leads to local production of IL-1b might initiate thyroid cell induced thyroid cell apoptosis. More likely, however, the accumulated and activated T cells expressing Fas ligand may induce apoptosis of the thyrocytes directly by interacting with Fas on the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Patients with subacute granulomatous (DeQuervain's) thyroiditis (presumed to be a viral infection) and congenital rubella may have thyroid antibodies for a few months after their illnesses, and the infections could initiate expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in the thyroid gland. However, neither disorder is known to be commonly followed by chronic thyroiditis although evidence of thyroid autoimmunity may persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second case of hyperthyroidism described by Parry in 1825 was a 21-year-old woman whose symptoms began four months after she had been thrown accidentally down the stairs in a wheelchair. Subsequently, stress of various types has been linked to Graves' hyperthyroidism. The proposed mechanisms include induction of immune suppression by non-antigen-specific mechanisms, perhaps due to the effects of cortisol or corticotropin-releasing hormone on immune cells, followed by immune hyperactivity leading to autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Such a mechanism might be operative in postpartum thyroiditis, which occurs three to nine months after delivery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum thyroiditis&quot;</a>). However, there is currently no evidence linking emotional or psychologic stress to Hashimoto's thyroiditis most probably because of the long natural history of the disease requiring a large part of the gland to be damaged before thyroid function is compromised.

Firstly, there is skewed X chromosome inactivation, which was found in 34 percent of female twins with autoimmune thyroid disease and only 11 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>], and so it is possible that the self-antigens on the inactivated X chromosome might not be expressed sufficiently to allow tolerance.

The <em>FOXP3</em> gene is on the X chromosome and commits na&iuml;ve T cells to become Treg cells, but the association is not strong and not seen in any of the Graves' disease genome-wide association studies (GWAS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356308201\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, there is a marked increase in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells which lead to diminished function of both T cells and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], and the rebound from this immunosuppression is thought to contribute to the development of postpartum Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

The trophoblast cells, located in the placenta and subject to maternal immune surveillance, serve as physical barriers between mother and fetus, and they have been shown to express several immune-modulating molecules, such as human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), Fas ligand, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase as well as secreting a variety of cytokines. HLA-G is one of the members of the MHC class I family and is known to inhibit natural killer function and dendritic cell maturation. Fas ligand interacts with Fas antigen and induces apoptotic cell death of fetal antigen-reactive maternal lymphocytes. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which catalyzes tryptophane in lymphocytes, has proven to be critical in the maintenance of allogeneic pregnancy in the mouse. Other than these local modulators, progesterone produced by the placenta affects cytokine profiles across the whole maternal immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].
