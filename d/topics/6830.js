The clinical manifestations of seizures vary based on the location of the seizure in the brain and the amount of cortex that is involved. Focal seizures are further classified according to whether consciousness is altered or not during the event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91409 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3005304355\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal seizures with retained awareness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of focal seizures with retained awareness (previously called simple partial seizures) vary from one patient to another and depend entirely on the part of the cortex that is disrupted at the onset of the seizure.</p><p>A seizure that begins in the occipital cortex may result in flashing lights, while a seizure that affects the motor cortex will result in rhythmic jerking movements of the face, arm, or leg on the side of the body opposite to the involved cortex (Jacksonian seizure). A seizure that begins in the parietal cortex may cause distortion of spatial perception; a seizure that begins in the dominant frontal lobe may cause sudden speech difficulties.</p><p>The symptoms that a patient experiences at the beginning of a seizure are sometimes referred to as the warning or aura. Auras are focal seizures that affect enough of the brain to cause symptoms, but not enough to interfere with consciousness. Auras that commonly occur in patients with epilepsy are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55996\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55996 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Some patients may have brief, subtle auras that go unrecognized or unreported for many months before they present with a more prolonged seizure or one that evolves into a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. A history of such events increases diagnostic confidence in seizure versus other paroxysmal events and has implications for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1988589890\" class=\"local\">'Prior events'</a> below.)</p><p>Postictally, patients may return immediately to their pre-event baseline or may experience a period of worsened neurologic function related to the location of the seizure in the brain. For example, patients with a simple motor seizure involving the left arm may have postictal weakness lasting for minutes to hours, referred to as a postictal Todd paralysis. In some cases, postictal weakness or aphasia is more prominent than the ictal phase of the seizure, leading clinicians to consider transient ischemic attack or stroke as a possible diagnosis at the time of initial presentation. (See <a href=\"#H1618254736\" class=\"local\">'Postictal period'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2472319025\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal seizures with impaired awareness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some focal seizures are associated with altered awareness at the onset of the seizure or as it progresses. These seizures, previously called complex partial seizures, are the most common type of seizure in adults with epilepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>During a typical focal seizure with impaired awareness, patients appear to be awake but are not in contact with others in their environment and do not respond normally to instructions or questions. They may stare into space and either remain motionless or engage in repetitive behaviors, called automatisms, such as facial grimacing, gesturing, chewing, lip smacking, or repeating words or phrases. Some patients may become hostile or aggressive if physically restrained.</p><p>Focal seizures with impaired awareness typically last less than three minutes and may begin with a phase of preserved awareness, which the patient sometimes can later describe. Afterward, the patient enters the postictal phase, often characterized by somnolence, confusion, and headache for up to several hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59341\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59341 \">table 3</a>). Patients often have no memory of what took place during the seizure other than, perhaps, the aura.</p><p>Focal seizures of both types may propagate diffusely to cause bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (previously referred to as secondarily generalized seizures). If propagation is slow, initial focal symptoms may be readily evident to the patient and observers prior to onset of the convulsive movements. If propagation is rapid, the seizures may closely resemble generalized-onset tonic-clonic seizures. In either case, patients may be amnestic to the initial focal phase of the seizure due to the effects of the generalized seizure. (See <a href=\"#H2802871457\" class=\"local\">'Generalized seizures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2802871457\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also called grand mal seizures, major motor seizures, or convulsions) are the most common type of generalized seizures.</p><p>Generalized tonic-clonic seizures begin with an abrupt loss of consciousness, sometimes in association with a scream or choking sound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54942 \">table 4</a>). All of the muscles of the arms and legs as well as the chest and back then become stiff. The patient may begin to appear cyanotic during this tonic phase. After approximately one minute, the muscles begin to jerk and twitch for an additional one to two minutes. During this clonic phase the tongue can be bitten, and frothy and bloody sputum may be seen coming out of the mouth. The postictal phase begins once the twitching movements end. The patient is initially in a deep sleep, breathing deeply, and then gradually wakes up. Postictal confusion or agitation is common. (See <a href=\"#H1618254736\" class=\"local\">'Postictal period'</a> below.)</p><p>In adults with a first-time seizure, most unprovoked generalized seizures represent secondarily generalized seizures that have evolved from a focal-onset seizure. As discussed above, symptoms of the focal phase of the seizure may be subtle or so brief that the patient has no recollection or warning prior to losing consciousness.</p><p>Other subtypes of generalized seizures are absence seizures, more often seen in childhood in association with generalized epilepsy syndromes, and clonic, myoclonic, tonic, and atonic seizures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence seizures (also called petit mal) usually occur during childhood and typically last between 5 and 10 seconds. They frequently occur in clusters and may take place dozens or even hundreds of times a day. Absence seizures cause sudden staring with impaired consciousness. If an absence seizure lasts for 10 seconds or more, there may also be eye blinking and lip smacking. Absence seizures are discussed in greater detail separately.

The pace of progression is more rapid than migraine aura, for example, which increases in intensity over the course of 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p>The majority of seizures end spontaneously within two to three minutes; more prolonged symptoms may be a clue to alternative conditions such as migraine, transient ischemic attack, or psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111740\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111740 \">table 7</a>).</p><p>Ictal behaviors are useful for localization, as well as to determine whether a seizure was focal or generalized. Generalized seizures are associated with immediate alteration of consciousness, whereas focal seizures are more variable. For focal seizures, some behaviors have localizing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lateralizing value. For example, versive head turning or eye deviation to the left suggests onset in the right frontal lobe, unilateral sensory disturbance suggests contralateral parietal lobe onset, and prominent dysphasia suggests involvement of the dominant hemisphere. (See <a href=\"#H1446120106\" class=\"local\">'Types of seizures'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The timing of the seizure in relation to sleep is also important to determine. Events that occur during sleep, or in the transition periods between sleep and wakefulness, have implications for both differential diagnosis and risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1860320207\" class=\"local\">'When to start antiseizure drug therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1618254736\"><span class=\"h3\">Postictal period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the end of a seizure, there is a period of transition from the ictal state back to the preseizure baseline level of awareness and function, referred to as the postictal period.</p><p>Manifestations of the postictal period typically include confusion and suppressed alertness. Focal neurologic deficits may also be present, often referred to as Todd paralysis or postictal paresis. The classic example of postictal paresis is weakness of a hand, arm, or leg that appears following a focal motor seizure involving the one side of the body. The degree of weakness is usually moderate but can be severe. Other focal postictal symptoms vary according the location of the seizure and may include aphasia, hemianopsia, or numbness.</p><p>The postictal state may last from seconds to minutes to hours, depending upon several factors including which part(s) of the brain were affected by the seizure; the length of the seizure; medications received, such as benzodiazepines; and age. As an example, young adults with focal seizures of frontal lobe origin may have postictal states that last only several seconds, while older patients with secondarily generalized seizures may have postictal confusion and sleepiness; confusion may persist for as long as several days to a week, particularly if there is underlying brain dysfunction or neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although there is a broad range, most patients begin to recover responsiveness and alertness within 10 to 20 minutes of a generalized seizure and show gradual, consistent improvement in postictal symptoms as time elapses. Patients with prolonged postictal symptoms should be evaluated for ongoing subclinical seizure activity with electroencephalography (EEG) and should undergo neuroimaging and lumbar puncture, as clinically indicated. (See <a href=\"#H359479441\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing'</a> below.)</p><p>In some cases, the postictal symptoms may be the presenting clinical feature, when the seizure itself is very brief, unwitnessed, or occurs during sleep. Particularly when the event is a first-time seizure, the clinical syndrome in these cases can be indistinguishable from that of acute stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Seizure precipitants or triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A key element in the history is whether a particular environmental or physiologic precipitant or trigger immediately preceded the seizure. Some patients with epilepsy tend to have seizures under particular conditions, and their first seizure may provide a clue to their so-called seizure trigger. Triggers include (but are not limited to) strong emotions, intense exercise, loud music, and flashing lights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These triggers are often experienced immediately before the seizure.</p><p>Other physiologic conditions such as fever, the menstrual period, lack of sleep, and stress can also precipitate seizures, probably by lowering seizure threshold rather than directly causing a seizure. As a result, the temporal relationship to the presenting seizure is often less clear. Triggers may also precipitate nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders, especially syncope.</p><p>However, the majority of patients with epilepsy have no identifiable or consistent trigger to their seizures. In addition, triggers are the sole cause of epileptic seizures in only a very small percentage of patients.</p><p>Photosensitivity is a relatively uncommon seizure trigger, although it occasionally receives heightened attention in relation to particular television shows or video games [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>].</p><p>Children are more susceptible to photic-induced seizures and photoparoxysmal EEG changes than adults, and a tendency for photic-induced seizures may be inherited. Photoconvulsive seizures are usually generalized, but they may be focal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988589890\"><span class=\"h3\">Prior events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substantial number of patients presenting for first evaluation of a seizure have had similar or related events in the past. In a retrospective study of 220 adults referred to a first-seizure clinic, 41 percent of patients endorsed one or more events before their index seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Delays in diagnosis were most common in patients with prior nonconvulsive events, although 28 percent of prior events were convulsive. Other studies have found similar results, with rates of prior seizure or probable seizure ranging from 20 to 60 percent in patients presenting with a &quot;first seizure&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>In some cases, prior events are subtle and may only be recognized when patients are directly asked about them. Young adults in particular should be asked whether they have ever experienced sudden jerks in the arms or legs shortly after awakening in the mornings, as these may represent epileptic myoclonic jerks commonly seen in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) or other generalized epilepsy syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy#H88578549\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Seizures'</a>.)</p><p>Additional examples of focal seizures or auras that may go unrecognized, unreported, or misattributed until patients experience a first-time (secondarily) generalized seizure include olfactory or gustatory hallucinations as a manifestation of temporal lobe epilepsy; brief episodes of fear, panic, or anxiety as a manifestation of temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy; and visual hallucinations as a manifestation of occipital-onset seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications and substances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of prescribed or over-the-counter medications that have been associated with iatrogenic seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F106961\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106961 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. For most drugs, the magnitude of risk is not well-characterized but is likely low unless medications are taken at supratherapeutic doses, in combination with other drugs that inhibit their metabolism, or in the setting of underlying liver or renal dysfunction. Focal-onset seizures are less likely to be drug-induced than generalized tonic-clonic seizures.</p><p>Alcohol intoxication or withdrawal and drugs of abuse should not be overlooked as a potential cause of seizure. Of note, however, a history of alcohol does not preclude other causes of seizure. In a study of 259 patients with first seizure suspected to be due to alcohol withdrawal, head computed tomography (CT) identified 16 patients (6 percent) with a clinically significant lesion (eg, subdural hematoma), and the presence of altered mental status or focal deficits did not correlate with abnormal head CT results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Past medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of risk factors for epileptic seizures that should be addressed, including head injury, abnormal early neurologic development or intellectual disability, stroke, Alzheimer disease, history of intracranial infection, alcohol or drug abuse, immunosuppression, history of cancer, rheumatologic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and hematologic disorders including sickle cell disease, porphyria, and antiphospholipid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive family history of seizures is a risk factor for epilepsy. In particular, absence seizures and myoclonic seizures may be inherited. Occasionally, a family member does not have seizures but has an abnormal EEG. One genetic epidemiology study suggests that while family history of seizures in siblings is reasonably accurate, seizures and epilepsy in parents are underreported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical and neurologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination is generally unrevealing in patients with epileptic seizures, but is important when central nervous system infection or hemorrhage are diagnostic possibilities. The neurologic examination should evaluate for lateralizing abnormalities, such as weakness, hyperreflexia, or a positive Babinski sign, that may point to a contralateral structural brain lesion.</p><p>A tongue bite or laceration may be evident in a patient who has had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Although tongue biting lacks sensitivity for the diagnosis (ie, it occurs in a minority of generalized tonic-clonic seizures), it does have high specificity in distinguishing epileptic events from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and syncope. In meta-analyses, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of tongue biting for a diagnosis of epileptic seizure are 20 to 33 percent and 96 to 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

In some guidelines, an exception is made for patients who can be confidently diagnosed with a genetic generalized epilepsy syndrome (also called idiopathic generalized epilepsy); in practice, however, the majority of these patients do undergo neuroimaging at the time of a first seizure.</p><p>The yield of neuroimaging in patients with a first seizure varies by imaging modality, age, and other factors. A systematic literature review of 15 published reports concluded that a noncontrast CT scan performed in the emergency department changed acute management in 9 to 17 percent of adult patients presenting with a first seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Relevant findings included intracranial hemorrhage, brain abscess, and tumor.</p><p>In young to middle-aged adults, common MRI findings are mesial temporal sclerosis, sequelae of head injury, congenital anomalies, brain tumors, cysticercosis, and vascular lesions. In older adults, MRIs often reveal strokes, cerebral degeneration, or neoplasms. However, over 50 percent of patients with epilepsy, regardless of age, have normal neuroimaging studies, and the likelihood of detecting an epileptogenic lesion is highest in those patients presenting with a focal seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Importantly, while structural abnormalities on brain MRI or CT usually suggest a symptomatic, focal-onset epilepsy syndrome, these findings should not be interpreted in isolation.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes of seizure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures are typically referred to as either acute symptomatic seizures or unprovoked seizures depending on the clinical circumstances at the time of the event. Epilepsy refers to the tendency for recurrent, unprovoked seizures. (See <a href=\"#H3930827855\" class=\"local\">'Epilepsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute symptomatic seizures are those that occur in the setting of acute medical (eg, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia) or neurologic illness or injury (eg, stroke, traumatic brain injury, meningitis, anoxic encephalopathy). Such seizures may recur during the index illness but generally carry a low risk of future epilepsy compared with unprovoked seizures. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute symptomatic seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure of unknown etiology as well as one that occurs in relation to a preexisting brain lesion or progressive nervous system disorder. Approximately one-third of adults with a first unprovoked seizure will have a recurrent seizure (ie, epilepsy) over the next five years. (See <a href=\"#H2412951470\" class=\"local\">'Unprovoked seizure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures are further categorized as either focal or generalized according to whether the onset of electrical activity involves a focal region of the brain or the entire cortex simultaneously. The clinical manifestations of seizures vary based on the location of the seizure in the brain and the amount of cortex that is involved. (See <a href=\"#H1446120106\" class=\"local\">'Types of seizures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of epilepsy can be broadly categorized as genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, and unknown. While a significant proportion of epilepsy in childhood has a genetic, metabolic, or congenital structural basis, epilepsy diagnosed in adults is more likely to be due to an acquired vascular, degenerative, or neoplastic etiology. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes of seizure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure is only one cause of transient neurologic symptoms with or without alteration of consciousness.
