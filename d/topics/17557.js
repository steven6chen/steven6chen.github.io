Severe vomiting resulting in dehydration and weight loss is termed hyperemesis gravidarum and occurs infrequently. Symptoms usually resolve by midpregnancy regardless of severity and therapy.</p><p>Management of women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy depends upon symptom severity, the impact of her symptoms on her health and quality of life, and the safety of treatment for both her and the fetus. Treatment approaches include <span class=\"nowrap\">dietary/lifestyle</span> changes, medication, and hospitalization for parenteral fluids and therapies in women with dehydration who fail to respond to outpatient management. Enteral or parenteral nutrition may be required for women with persistent weight loss despite these interventions.</p><p>The treatment and outcome of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy will be reviewed here. Our approach is generally consistent with that of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathophysiology, clinical features, and evaluation of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H169438327\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY AND TREATMENT GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When managing women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, the goals are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine the severity of disease: nausea alone, vomiting without dehydration, or vomiting with dehydration. These designations refer to the woman's primary problem and are somewhat arbitrary as the frequency of vomiting typically varies from day to day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correct dehydration, if present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce symptoms and improve quality of life by changing her diet and environment and beginning medication, in a step-wise approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent serious complications of persistent vomiting, including electrolyte abnormalities, vitamin deficiency (eg, Wernicke encephalopathy), and extreme weight loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize the fetal effects of maternal nausea and vomiting and its treatment.</p><p/><p>Early treatment of women with mild and moderate symptoms may prevent progression to severe disease (hyperemesis gravidarum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21389041\"><span class=\"h1\">NAUSEA ALONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women whose primary symptom is nausea, the initial treatment approach involves counseling about dietary changes and trigger avoidance. Ginger <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pyridoxine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-and-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxylamine-pyridoxine</a> is added if symptoms do not improve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74451\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74451 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21389346\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3323758764\"><span class=\"h3\">Meals and snacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with nausea should eat before, or as soon as, they feel hungry to avoid an empty stomach, which can aggravate nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A snack before getting out of bed in the morning and snacks during the night (eg, crackers with peanut butter or cheese taken prior to bathroom trips) may be helpful. </p><p>Meals and snacks should be eaten slowly and in small amounts every one to two hours to avoid an overly full stomach, which can also aggravate nausea for some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Foods high in sugar may exacerbate symptoms. </p><p>Women should determine what foods they tolerate best and try to eat those foods. Dietary manipulations that help some women include eliminating coffee and spicy, odorous, high-fat, acidic, and very sweet foods, and substituting <span class=\"nowrap\">snacks/meals</span> that are protein-dominant, salty, low-fat, bland, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dry (eg, nuts, pretzels, crackers, cereal, toast) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Drinking peppermint tea or sucking peppermint candies may reduce postprandial nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>However, high-quality evidence of the optimal dietary components to reduce nausea are sparse. Although clinicians commonly recommend ingestion of frequent, small, carbohydrate-predominant <span class=\"nowrap\">meals/snacks,</span> such as soda crackers or dry toast, based primarily on anecdotal evidence passed down over a century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], consumption of protein-predominant <span class=\"nowrap\">meals/snacks</span> may be more helpful and was associated with quantifiable decreases in nausea in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Women whose symptoms are related to delayed gastric emptying should improve with a diet consisting of low-fat solids and liquids since these foods are more readily emptied by the stomach; however, it is not known to what degree gastric emptying and dysfunction account for symptoms in women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2672368287\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluids should be consumed at least 30 minutes before or after solid food to minimize the effect of a full stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fluids are better tolerated if cold, clear, and carbonated or sour (eg, ginger ale, lemonade, popsicles) and taken in small amounts; using a straw or very small cup sometimes helps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some women find aromatic liquids, such as lemon or mint tea, more tolerable. Small volumes of electrolyte-replacement sports drinks can be used to replace both fluids and electrolytes, if tolerated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Along with dietary changes, avoidance of environmental triggers is a key intervention for reducing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Examples of some triggers include stuffy rooms, odors (eg, perfume, chemicals, food, smoke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], heat, humidity, noise, and visual or physical motion (eg, flickering lights, driving) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Quickly changing position and not getting enough <span class=\"nowrap\">rest/sleep,</span> may also aggravate symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Lying down soon after eating and lying on the left side are additional potentially aggravating factors because these actions may delay gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cold solid foods are tolerated better than hot solid foods because they have less odor and require less preparation time (ie, shorter exposure to the trigger if the woman is preparing her own meal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Brushing teeth after a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], spitting out saliva, and frequently washing out the mouth can also be helpful. Switching to a different toothpaste may help women for whom strong mint-flavored toothpaste is a trigger. </p><p>Supplements containing iron should be avoided until symptoms resolve, as iron causes gastric irritation and can provoke nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Taking prenatal vitamins before bed with a snack, instead of in the morning or on an empty stomach, may also be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some women may better tolerate chewable prenatal vitamins. If prenatal vitamins are stopped, a supplement containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (400 to 800 mcg daily) is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1162581191\"><span class=\"h2\">Ginger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest use of ginger-containing foods (eg, ginger lollipops, ginger tea, foods made with ginger root or syrup) for women with nausea. We do not prescribe powdered ginger because standard pharmacologic-grade ginger preparations are not readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; however, if prescribed, a common dose is 1 to 1.5 g orally divided over 24 hours (eg, 250 mg ginger capsules orally four times a day). In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials (n = 1278 pregnant women), ginger improved nausea compared with placebo but did not significantly reduce vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H570468476\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacotherapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850764225\"><span class=\"h3\">Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyridoxine can improve nausea, has a good safety profile with minimal side effects, and is easy to obtain; therefore, we generally begin pyridoxine as the initial drug treatment.</p><p>As a single agent, the recommended dose of pyridoxine is 10 to 25 mg orally every six to eight hours; the maximum treatment dose suggested for pregnant women is 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Sensory neuropathy has been reported with chronic intake of pyridoxine at doses &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], but cumulative doses up to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> appear to be safe for the mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Human data on fetal safety at this dose are limited. An observational study of 96 pregnant women in the first trimester with &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> pyridoxine intake (mean dose 132 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> range 50 to 510 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and 96 control pregnant women found no associated major fetal malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Pyridoxine 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> was not teratogenic in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Systematic reviews of randomized <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> controlled trials have shown that pyridoxine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>) improves mild to moderate nausea but does not significantly reduce vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The mechanism for the therapeutic effect is unknown. Hypotheses include <span class=\"nowrap\">prevention/treatment</span> of vitamin B6 deficiency, intrinsic antinausea properties, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> synergy with the antinausea properties of antihistamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although vitamin B6 levels decrease as gestation advances, there is no proven correlation between maternal vitamin B6 levels and incidence or severity of nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1615634895\"><span class=\"h3\">Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend the combination drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-and-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxylamine-pyridoxine</a> when pyridoxine treatment of nausea fails to improve symptoms. Formulations of doxylamine-pyridoxine are available under various names worldwide (eg, Diclectin in Canada, Diclegis and Bonjesta in the United States).</p><p>Initially, we prescribe two extended-release tablets (each tablet contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxylamine</a> 10 mg and pyridoxine 10 mg) at bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The dose may be increased to four tablets over the course of the day as needed for more severe nausea (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon, two tablets at bedtime). An extended-release tablet containing 20 mg of doxylamine succinate and 20 mg of pyridoxine is also available. A randomized placebo-controlled trial found that doxylamine succinate 10 mg and pyridoxine 10 mg combination preparation administered in doses of two to four tablets daily was safe and well tolerated by women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Combination tablets may be costly. In the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxylamine</a> is available in some over-the-counter sleeping pills (eg, Unisom Sleep Tabs) and as a prescription antihistamine chewable tablet (eg, Aldex AN): One-half of the 25 mg over-the-counter tablet or two chewable 5 mg tablets can be used off-label as an antiemetic. In addition, pyridoxine 25 mg, also available over-the-counter, is taken three or four times per day; the 10 mg dose of pyridoxine is not commercially available in the United States. This is a reasonable, less expensive substitute for combination tablets.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-and-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxylamine-pyridoxine</a> was proven modestly effective for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and appears to be more effective than either drug alone. It was the formulation for Bendectin, which was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1983 due to lawsuits alleging teratogenicity, although scientific evidence supports its safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/20,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,30,31</a>] and efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/29,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32-35</a>]. A meta-analysis of controlled studies on outcome of pregnancies exposed to Bendectin reported no increase in the incidence of birth defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other interventions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture or acupressure &ndash; P6 acupressure wristbands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82211 \">picture 1</a>) do not require a prescription and have become a popular self-administered intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a 2015 systematic review of randomized trials of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, an acupressure wristband or P6 acupuncture was not significantly more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. One reason may be that a strong placebo effect has been observed in patients who receive sham therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. Acupressure and acupuncture have not been associated with any adverse effects on pregnancy outcome and may help some women, even if a placebo effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Self-administered nerve stimulation therapy over the volar aspect of the wrist at the P6 acupressure point using a commercial device has shown mixed results, with some promise in two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypnosis has been reported to be helpful in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most other alternative medicine approaches have not been studied rigorously for efficacy or safety, and should be avoided for this reason. As an example, in 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration notified health care professionals and pregnant or breastfeeding women to avoid consuming Nzu, a traditional African remedy for morning sickness, because of potential health risks from high levels of lead and arsenic, a problem that has been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21389041\" class=\"local\">'Nausea alone'</a> above.)</p><p>We also offer additional drugs that are reported to be effective and have a good maternal-fetal safety profile. If the initial drug is ineffective, then other drugs are added in a step-wise progression as a combination of drugs may be effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74451\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74451 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. We typically continue a drug for a week to determine whether nausea and vomiting are improving. If symptoms persist, then we add another class of drug to the existing regimen; however, if the patient is experiencing side effects, we substitute another drug in its place.</p><p>Women who are vomiting most food and liquids require frequent, even daily, assessment of their medical status and response to therapy. Ambulatory management may be appropriate for women with severe symptoms who have a strong preference to avoid admission, provided intensive follow-up and daily treatment with intravenous fluid and injectable medication are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Those who are becoming dehydrated or who have vital sign or neurologic changes are admitted for hour-to-hour evaluation and more intensive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H217940\" class=\"local\">'Vomiting with dehydration'</a> below.)</p><p>Historically, pregnant women have been excluded from most clinical drug trials. Thus, there are limited data from pregnant women to support the safety and efficacy of drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting. A number of reports have demonstrated that antiemetic drug therapy is more effective than placebo and does not increase the incidence of congenital anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/8,11,23,29,32,49,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,23,29,32,49,51</a>]. However, there is little evidence from well-designed comparative trials that show clear superiority of one medication over another. It is therefore recommended that safety profiles, patient tolerance, and cost be considered in the choice of initial management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H218526\"><span class=\"h2\">Add an antihistamine (H1 antagonists)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxylamine</a> and pyridoxine (see <a href=\"#H1615634895\" class=\"local\">'Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine'</a> above) has been ineffective, it should be discontinued before starting a different antihistamine.

Clear instructions about when to seek additional medical care (ie, hypoglycemia that does not resolve with oral glucose intake, intractable vomiting) or about how to appropriately self-adjust insulin dosing based on food intake are essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=special-situations-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Special situations in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Sick-day management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H222950\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF STABLE AND IMPROVING PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We continue the drug regimen that has been effective until the patient has been completely asymptomatic (no nausea or vomiting) for at least a week. At that time, we discontinue the medications and see how she responds. If nausea and vomiting recurs, we resume therapy. The majority of women will have resolution of nausea and vomiting by 16 to 20 weeks of gestation and will be able to discontinue their medications. Rare patients require therapy beyond 20 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME AND PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550221342\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term outcomes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550221006\"><span class=\"h3\">Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the maternal course can be long and tedious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>], nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is typically not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in the absence of severe malnutrition. There is strong evidence that women with nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy have a <strong>lower</strong> rate of miscarriage than women without these symptoms. In one meta-analysis, the odds of miscarriage in women with nausea and vomiting in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy was odds ratio (OR) 0.36 (95% CI 0.2-0.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. The analysis did not correlate outcome with respect to the severity of the disorder, most of the women in the studies had mild symptoms rather than hyperemesis, most data were collected retrospectively, and women with pregnancy losses before recognition of pregnancy were not included.</p><p>These limitations were addressed in a subsequent prospective study of 797 women with a history of one or two pregnancy losses in whom early pregnancy was identified by daily periconceptional human chorionic gonadotrophin testing and nausea and vomiting were recorded in preconception and pregnancy diaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. In this population, nausea alone was associated with a 50 percent reduction in clinical pregnancy loss (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0.80), and nausea with vomiting was associated with a 75 percent reduction in clinical pregnancy loss (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12-0.51), after adjustment for covariates (eg, age, smoking, number of prior losses and live births, karyotype). Symptomatic women had a similar reduction in peri-implantation pregnancy loss, which was not statistically significant.</p><p>The frequency of congenital anomalies is not increased among offspring of gravidas with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy or hyperemesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>], whether or not they take antiemetic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/71,127-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,127-131</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550221100\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperemesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the potential severity of hyperemesis gravidarum and its attendant early weight loss, most studies have reported no difference in birth weight or gestational age at birth between affected pregnancies and those unaffected by severe vomiting, as long as prepregnancy weight was normal and there was &quot;catch-up&quot; weight gain later in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/128,129,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">128,129,132</a>].

The steps are based on evidence of efficacy and safety profiles.
