The source is virtually always maternal, rather than fetal. Bleeding may result from disruption of blood vessels in the decidua (ie, pregnancy endometrium) or from discrete cervical or vaginal lesions. The clinician typically makes a provisional clinical diagnosis based upon the patient's gestational age and the character of her bleeding (light or heavy, associated with pain or painless, intermittent or constant). Laboratory and imaging tests are then used to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis.</p><p>An overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women will be reviewed here. Specific causes of bleeding and their management are discussed in detail separately. (Refer to individual topic reviews on each subject).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST TRIMESTER BLEEDING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062803\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding is common in the first trimester (0 to 13<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup></span> weeks), occurring in 20 to 40 percent of pregnant women. It may be any combination of light or heavy, intermittent or constant, painless or painful. The four major sources of nontraumatic bleeding in early pregnancy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ectopic pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscarriage (threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implantation of the pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical, vaginal, or uterine pathology (eg, polyps, <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/infection,</span> trophoblastic disease)</p><p/><p>Bleeding related to miscarriage is the most common nontraumatic cause of first trimester bleeding (prevalence of miscarriage 15 to 20 percent of pregnancies). Although bleeding may be heavy, only about 1 percent of expectantly managed women require blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ectopic pregnancy is much less common (prevalence of ectopic pregnancy: 2 percent of pregnancies), but the most serious etiology of first trimester bleeding as rupture of the extrauterine pregnancy is a life-threatening complication; therefore, this diagnosis must be excluded in every pregnant woman with bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact etiology of uterine bleeding in the first trimester often cannot be determined; the goal of the evaluation is to make a definitive diagnosis when possible and exclude the presence of serious pathology in the remaining cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F88947\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88947 \">algorithm 1</a>). Ectopic pregnancy is particularly important to exclude since it can be life-threatening. Thus, the first step in evaluation is to determine whether the patient has had an ultrasound examination, as well as the results of the test. Prior documentation that the pregnancy is in the normal intrauterine location immediately narrows the differential diagnosis, although the possibility that the prior ultrasound may have missed a heterotopic pregnancy (ie, one intrauterine and one extrauterine pregnancy) or a cornual (interstitial) ectopic pregnancy should always be considered. If in doubt, consider having an experienced sonographer repeat the ultrasound examination. It is also important to determine whether the patient is hemodynamically unstable so that supportive measures and treatment can be rapidly initiated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of bleeding should be determined: is the woman passing blood clots or is the blood soaking through her clothes? Does she feel lightheaded? Does she have significant pelvic pain or cramping? Has she passed any tissue? If she answers yes to these questions, then ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage are much more likely diagnoses than implantation bleeding or cervicovaginal disease (eg, polyps, cervicitis, cancer). On the other hand, it is important to remember that the presence of only light, intermittent, painless bleeding does not exclude the possibility of a life-threatening underlying disorder, such as ectopic pregnancy.</p><p>What is the patient's medical history? A past history of ectopic pregnancy or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (eg, history of pelvic inflammatory disease, presence of an intrauterine contraceptive device, adnexal surgery) increases the probability of this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Epidemiology, risk factors, and anatomic sites&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A history of two or more consecutive miscarriages or a condition associated with miscarriage (eg, parental chromosomal translocation, maternal antiphospholipid syndrome, uterine anomaly) suggests bleeding may be related to impending pregnancy loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous abortion: Risk factors, etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of assisted reproductive techniques to achieve conception increases the risk of heterotopic pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-pregnancy-cesarean-scar-pregnancy-and-heterotopic-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal pregnancy, cesarean scar pregnancy, and heterotopic pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthostatic changes in blood pressure or pulse are indicative of severe blood loss requiring supportive care and rapid treatment. However, occasionally, young pregnant women can have massive bleeding without demonstrating tachycardia or hypotension. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary delay in the management of such patients.</p><p>Any tissue the patient has passed should be examined. Patients may mistake blood clot for the products of conception. If the tissue represents a partial or complete miscarriage, the fetal membranes, fronds indicative of placental villi, or an intact fetus should be visible upon careful examination. Visualization of villi can be facilitated by floating the products of conception in water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78715%7EOBGYN%2F61424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78715 graphicRef61424 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The patient's abdomen should be examined before performing an internal examination. It is best to begin by examining the quadrant where the patient is experiencing the least pain. Gentle percussion is preferred to deep palpation since it causes less pain and guarding. Midline pain is more consistent with miscarriage, while lateral pain is more consistent with ectopic pregnancy. Nongynecologic causes of pain are also to be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should determine whether uterine size is appropriate for the estimated gestational age. The size - gestational age correlation is learned by experience and is often described in terms of fruit (eg, 6- to 8-week size = small pear, 8- to 10-week size = orange, 10- to 12-week size = grapefruit). The uterus remains a pelvic organ until approximately 12 weeks of gestation, when it becomes sufficiently large to palpate transabdominally just above the symphysis pubis. The normal uterus is nontender, smooth, and firm.</p><p>If the pregnancy is at or beyond 10 to 12 weeks of gestation, a handheld Doppler device can be used to check the fetal heart beat. The fetal heart rate usually can be easily distinguished from the maternal heart rate since the fetal heart rate is typically in the range of 110 to 160 beats per minute; however, the difference in maternal and fetal heart rates can be minimal if the mother has tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Doppler confirmation of fetal cardiac activity is reassuring, as it indicates bleeding is not related to fetal demise and unlikely to be related to an ectopic pregnancy. On the other hand, loss of a previously detected fetal heart beat should raise suspicion that fetal demise has occurred. However, inability to detect fetal heart motion by Doppler, particularly in the first trimester, may merely reflect the difficulty in blindly finding the location of the tiny fetal heart.</p><p>After the abdominal examination, the patient is placed in the lithotomy position. The external genitalia are examined to assess the volume and source of bleeding and then a speculum is inserted into the vagina. If blood clots, products of conception, or both are present, they can be removed with gauze sponges on a sponge forceps. This tissue is examined as described above and, by convention, sent for pathologic examination to confirm the presence of products of conception and to exclude gestational trophoblastic disease. The utility of routine histopathological examination is questionable, as it rarely suggests the underlying cause of the pregnancy failure or establishes a diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, pathologists can sometimes diagnose entities that are the probable cause of the loss or associated with recurrent loss. These include massive chronic intervillositis, massive intervillous fibrin deposition, maternal vasculitis, findings suggestive of some chromosomal anomalies (eg, triploidy, some trisomies), and septic abortion.</p><p>Speculum examination may reveal a source of bleeding unrelated to pregnancy; in such cases, further evaluation depends upon the nature of the abnormality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal laceration (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal neoplasm (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal cancer&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal warts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal discharge (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical polyps, fibroids, ectropion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cervical anomalies and benign cervical lesions&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucopurulent cervical discharge or friability at the cervical os (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cervicitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cervicitis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical neoplasm (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Visualization of the cervical os helps to distinguish between a threatened and an <span class=\"nowrap\">impending/inevitable</span> miscarriage. Direct visualization of the gestational sac in a dilated cervix is generally sufficient to diagnose an <span class=\"nowrap\">impending/inevitable</span> miscarriage clinically. The cervix will usually also be open with an incomplete or a recent complete miscarriage. An open internal cervical os will admit a small instrument, such as a cotton-tipped swab. Ultrasound can provide additional information in these cases, such as whether or not there are retained products of conception, or the unexpected presence of a twin pregnancy with a second viable gestational sac.</p><p>A closed cervix is most consistent with a threatened miscarriage, but not diagnostic. If the cervix appears closed and there are no obvious bleeding lesions, the speculum is removed and a bimanual pelvic examination is performed. With an ectopic pregnancy, findings on pelvic examination may include adnexal, cervical motion, or abdominal tenderness; an adnexal mass; and mild uterine enlargement. However, the physical examination is often unremarkable in a woman with a small, unruptured ectopic pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uterine size larger than expected for dates suggests a multiple gestation, possibly with miscarriage of one of the multiples, gestational trophoblastic disease (molar pregnancy), or other uterine pathology (fibroids can cause an irregularly enlarged uterus). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydatidiform mole: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One review of data from observational studies concluded that ultrasound examination and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration (both discussed below) could replace pelvic examination in the initial evaluation of patients with early pregnancy bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, some diagnoses will be missed with this approach (eg, bleeding from cervical or vaginal lesions), this combination of tests may not distinguish between a complete miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy (both will have an empty uterus and positive hCG), and the additional cost of the tests can be avoided in some patients. For example, in bleeding patients in whom sonography has previously confirmed a viable singleton intrauterine pregnancy, another examination is not necessary to exclude ectopic pregnancy or to confirm fetal viability if fetal heart motion can be detected by a handheld Doppler device. Additionally, there is no value in checking hCG concentration once the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy has been established sonographically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Transvaginal ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transvaginal ultrasonography is the cornerstone of the evaluation of bleeding in early pregnancy. It is most useful in bleeding patients with a positive pregnancy test in whom an intrauterine pregnancy has not been previously confirmed by imaging studies. In these women, ultrasound examination is performed to determine whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine (ectopic) and, if intrauterine, whether the pregnancy is viable (fetal cardiac activity present) or nonviable. The possibility of heterotopic pregnancy should always be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-pregnancy-cesarean-scar-pregnancy-and-heterotopic-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal pregnancy, cesarean scar pregnancy, and heterotopic pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to note that the absence of an intrauterine gestational sac is highly suggestive of ectopic pregnancy if more than 5.5 to 6 weeks have elapsed since the first day of the patient's last menstrual period. At earlier gestational ages, however, an intrauterine pregnancy may be present, but not yet identifiable, by ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83304 \">table 1</a>). In these cases, sonographic findings are correlated with hCG levels. The use of sonography and hCG in the differential diagnosis of intrauterine versus extrauterine pregnancy and viable versus nonviable intrauterine pregnancy is described briefly below (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> below) and in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-abortion-risk-factors-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous abortion: Risk factors, etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, ultrasound examination reveals unusual causes of uterine bleeding, such as gestational trophoblastic disease or loss of one fetus from a multiple gestation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydatidiform mole: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-prenatal-issues#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Prenatal issues&quot;, section on 'Risk of early, late, and postnatal loss'</a>.)</p><p>In bleeding patients in whom sonography has previously confirmed a viable singleton intrauterine pregnancy, another examination is not necessary to confirm fetal viability if fetal heart motion can be detected by a handheld Doppler device.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369904\"><span class=\"h4\">Other imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first trimester, transabdominal ultrasound imaging is most useful for assessing free fluid in the abdomen and abnormalities beyond the field of view of a high-frequency vaginal probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely indicated as a second-line imaging modality for further evaluation of limited and nondiagnostic ultrasound, unusual ectopic pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease, and differentiating causes of severe pelvic pain and adnexal masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Computed tomography may be useful in pregnant patients with trauma or acute non-gynecologic pain, for staging of malignancy, or if magnetic resonance imaging is not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no role for monitoring hCG concentration once the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy has been established sonographically. Serial measurements of hCG are helpful during the first six weeks of pregnancy if ultrasonography is nondiagnostic, ie, the site and viability of the pregnancy are not revealed. In this setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falling beta-hCG concentrations are consistent with a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy or involuting ectopic pregnancy, but do not indicate whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or ectopic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriately rising hCG levels are most consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy (99.9 percent of viable pregnancies display a rise in hCG greater than 35 percent over 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]), but 21 percent of ectopic pregnancies also display rising hCG levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>hCG levels that have plateaued or are rising very slowly (less than 35 percent over 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]) suggest an ectopic pregnancy or an abnormal intrauterine pregnancy.</p><p/><p>The pattern of hCG change in normal and abnormal pregnancies and its correlation with ultrasound findings are discussed in detail separately, and summarized below.

Women with significant first trimester vaginal bleeding (ie, more than spotting) should have a red blood cell antibody screen checked. Those who are Rh(D) negative are given anti-D immunoglobulin to protect against Rh(D) isoimmunization, unless the vaginal bleeding is clearly due to a non-placental, nonfetal source, such as a vaginal laceration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Rhesus (D) alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Ectopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women with early pregnancy bleeding and pain are assumed to have ectopic pregnancy until this diagnosis has been excluded by laboratory and imaging studies. Women with a history of ectopic pregnancy or other risk factors for the disorder are at highest risk, but many women with ectopic pregnancy have no risk factors. </p><p>In the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer, absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound examination when the hCG concentration is greater than 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> (greater than 6000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> for transabdominal ultrasound) strongly suggests ectopic pregnancy (with very experienced sonographers, the hCG threshold may be lower) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This threshold is somewhat institution-dependent and does not account for the possibility of a very early multiple gestation (hCG levels are higher in multiple gestations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Diagnosis of intrauterine (viable or nonviable) versus extrauterine pregnancy at hCG concentrations below 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> is complicated and discussed in detail separately.

The term &quot;threatened&quot; is used to describe these cases because miscarriage does not always follow uterine bleeding in early pregnancy, even after repeated episodes or large amounts of bleeding. In fact, 90 to 96 percent of pregnancies with both fetal cardiac activity and vaginal bleeding at 7 to 11 weeks of gestation do not miscarry; the higher success rate is associated with bleeding at the later end of the gestational age range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Uterine bleeding in these cases is likely due to disruption of decidual vessels at the maternal-fetal interface.

If this has occurred, the uterus is small on physical examination and well contracted with an open or closed cervix, scant vaginal bleeding, and only mild cramping. Ultrasound will reveal an empty uterus and no extrauterine gestation.</p><p>A complete miscarriage can be distinguished from an ectopic pregnancy by examining the tissue that was passed to confirm products of conception, by demonstrating falling rather than rising or plateaued hCG levels, and by patient description of diminishing bleeding and pain. No further intervention is needed for complete miscarriage if chorionic villi are identified by pathologic examination of the products of conception. However, if no villi are identified or no specimens are available for pathologic examination, then serum hCG levels should be followed serially until the level is undetectable.

Although abdominal, heterotopic, cervical, cornual, and cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies often present at more advanced gestations than tubal ectopics, these types of ectopic pregnancy are rare.</p><p>The first step in the evaluation is to determine the extent of bleeding and whether bleeding is accompanied by pain. The presence of only light, intermittent, painless bleeding suggests bloody show from cervical insufficiency, a small marginal placental separation, or a cervical or vaginal lesion (eg, polyp, infection, cancer). Heavier bleeding, particularly when associated with pain, is more consistent with impending miscarriage or a larger placental separation (ie, abruption). <span class=\"nowrap\">Hemoglobin/hematocrit</span> and coagulation studies should be obtained in all women who are hemodynamically unstable&nbsp;(hypotension, tachycardia, orthostasis, syncope). A baseline <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit</span> measurement can be useful in women with heavy vaginal bleeding, particularly if persistent.</p><p>As discussed above, loss of a previously detected fetal heart beat should raise suspicion that fetal demise has occurred, but inability to detect the fetal heart by Doppler is subject to physician error and should always be confirmed by ultrasound examination. On the other hand, Doppler confirmation of fetal cardiac activity is reliable and reassuring.</p><p>An abdominal examination is performed to assess for pain or other abnormalities and uterine size. At 16 weeks of gestation, the uterine fundus is palpable about midway between the symphysis pubis and umbilicus, while at 20 weeks, it is palpable at about the level of the umbilicus. After the abdominal examination, the patient is placed in the lithotomy position. The external genitalia are examined and then a speculum is inserted into the vagina. As discussed above, physical examination may reveal a nonpregnancy-related source of bleeding, such as cervical ectropion, an abnormal growth, a laceration, or sanguineous-purulent discharge.</p><p>Direct visualization of a dilated cervix or fetal membranes may be sufficient to diagnose impending miscarriage if contractions are present, or cervical insufficiency in the absence of contractions.</p><p>Transvaginal ultrasonography is also the cornerstone in the evaluation of bleeding in the second trimester. The primary goals are to determine whether the placenta is covering the cervical os (placenta previa), whether there is evidence of decidual hemorrhage causing placental separation (ie, abruptio placenta), and whether the cervix shows signs suggestive of cervical insufficiency (short length, dilated internal os, prolapse of the fetal membranes).

Classically, the absence of abdominal pain and uterine contractions was considered the clinical feature that distinguished between placenta previa and abruptio placenta, which is the other major cause of vaginal bleeding at this time. However, some women with placenta previa have uterine contractions in addition to bleeding; thus, the diagnosis of placenta previa must be determined by sonographic examination.

The most common risk factors include prior placental abruption, trauma, smoking, cocaine use, hypertension, and preterm premature rupture of the membranes.</p><p>Clinically, placental abruption typically presents with vaginal bleeding (80 percent), uterine tenderness (70 percent), and uterine contractions (35 percent), with or without nonreassuring fetal testing. Uterine tenderness is caused by extravasation of blood into the myometrium (called a Couvelaire uterus, an enlarged bluish-purple uterus due to the extravasation of blood through the myometrium to the serosa). In severe cases, blood can even penetrate to the peritoneal cavity. The amount of vaginal bleeding may not be a reliable indicator of the severity of the hemorrhage since bleeding may be concealed (retained in the uterine cavity). Ultrasound may show placental separation, but this is uncommon (only 2 percent of abruptions can be visualized on ultrasound); the major purpose of ultrasound examination is to exclude placenta previa. Abruption ranges from mild to severe (life-threatening) and may be acute or chronic.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'First trimester bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An important goal in the evaluation of women with bleeding in early pregnancy is to exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, since ruptured ectopic pregnancy can result in severe hemorrhage and death. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ectopic pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major causes of bleeding in the second and third trimesters are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110390\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110390 \">algorithm 2</a>): bloody show associated with labor (by definition, labor occurs after 20 weeks) or cervical insufficiency; miscarriage (by definition, miscarriage occurs before 20 weeks); placenta previa; abruptio placenta; and, rarely, uterine rupture or vasa previa. Cervical, vaginal, or uterine pathology (eg, polyps, <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/infection,</span> trophoblastic disease) and non-tubal ectopic pregnancy are other etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Second and third trimester bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital examination of the cervix <strong>should be avoided</strong> in women presenting with bleeding in the second half of pregnancy until placenta previa has been excluded because digital examination of a placenta previa can cause immediate, severe hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with uterine bleeding who are Rh(D)-negative, we recommend anti-D <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> to protect against Rh(D) alloimmunization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
