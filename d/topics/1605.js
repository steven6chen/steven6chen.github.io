It's important to know what your asthma triggers are. That way, you can avoid them so that your symptoms don't get worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14324425\"><span class=\"h1\">What are some common asthma triggers?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common asthma triggers are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting sick with a cold, the flu, or a lung, ear, or sinus infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong cleaning products, such as bleach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong perfumes or scents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air pollution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> and other medicines for pain or fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very cold and dry air</p><p/><p>People can have other triggers, too. These include things in the environment that they are allergic to. These are called &quot;allergic triggers.&quot; Examples of allergic triggers are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dust mites &ndash; These are tiny bugs that are too small for you to see. They live in beds, couches, carpets, and other places in your home.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mold &ndash; Mold can grow in basements, showers, and other damp and wet places.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dogs and cats &ndash; People can be allergic to animal saliva, urine, or dander (flakes of dead skin).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pollen from trees, grass, and weeds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cockroach droppings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mice</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14324432\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know what my asthma triggers are?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might already know what makes your asthma symptoms worse. But if you don't, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she can help you figure it out by talking with you and asking you questions.</p><p>Your doctor might do allergy tests to see if you have allergic triggers. Allergy tests include blood tests or skin tests. During a skin test, a doctor puts a drop of a substance that you might be allergic to on your skin, and makes a tiny needle prick in the skin. Then, he or she watches your skin to see if it turns red and bumpy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14324439\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do when I find out what my triggers are?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best thing to do is to stay away from your triggers. For example, if cigarette smoke makes your asthma symptoms worse, avoid people who are smoking. Here are other things that you can do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid getting sick with an infection, wash your hands often. You can also get a flu shot every year so you don't get the flu.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid air pollution, stay indoors when air pollution levels are high, and don't exercise near a busy road.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On winter days when the air is cold and dry, cover your mouth and nose with a scarf.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using bleach and other strong cleaners.</p><p/><p>If you have allergic triggers, try to avoid the things you are allergic to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid dust mites, cover your pillows and mattresses with special covers that keep dust mites away, and remove carpets from the bedroom. For more tips, see the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79168 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid mold, regularly clean any areas that tend to grow mold, such as sinks and tiles. To keep more mold from growing, use a dehumidifier, fix leaky plumbing, and remove carpets that were damaged by water. You can also remove any indoor plants, as well as other items that might have gotten damp and grown mold, such as old books or bedding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid animal saliva, urine, or dander, you can remove the pet from your home and clean your home after the animal has gone. For more tips, see the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58126 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid pollen, you can stay inside more during the times of year when your asthma symptoms are worse. Keep windows closed to prevent pollen from getting inside your house. When you do go outside, shower or bathe after you come back in. This can help remove any pollen from your body and clothing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To keep cockroaches away, don't let garbage or dirty dishes pile up. Fix leaky plumbing so there are no puddles of water. If you have cockroaches, use traps to kill them, or call an exterminator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To get rid of mice, set traps or call an exterminator.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14324446\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I can't avoid my triggers?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you can't avoid your triggers, talk with your doctor or nurse about what you can do.</p><p>Exercise is an example of a trigger that you should not avoid, because exercise keeps you healthy. To prevent asthma symptoms when you exercise:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take an extra dose of your quick-relief inhaler medicine before you exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm up slowly before each exercise session</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid exercising outdoors if it is very cold out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14324453\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-childs-metered-dose-inhaler-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your child's metered dose inhaler (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-childs-dry-powder-inhaler-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your child's dry powder inhaler (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-asthma-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Trigger avoidance in asthma (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
