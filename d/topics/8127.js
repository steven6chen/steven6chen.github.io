Hepatitis A is a specific type of hepatitis that is caused by a virus.</p><p>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection occurs worldwide. The number of people who become infected with HAV in the United States has declined substantially since vaccination became available; the vaccine is routinely recommended for all infants and any adult who is at high risk of becoming infected. In 2014, 0.4 persons per 100,000 were infected with HAV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-a-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>However, the infection rate is much higher in developing countries. Among travelers to developing countries, about three in every 1,000 travelers staying in luxury hotels acquire hepatitis A every month, and about 20 in every 1,000 travelers who eat or drink in poor hygienic conditions acquire hepatitis A every month.</p><p>This topic review discusses how hepatitis A is spread, the signs and symptoms of HAV infection, how it is diagnosed and treated, and how it can be prevented. Other types of hepatitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis B (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis C (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DID I BECOME INFECTED WITH HEPATITIS A?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hepatitis A virus is carried in the stool of infected people. The most common way for the virus to be spread is when an infected person does not wash their hands after using the bathroom and then touches food, a surface, or another person's mouth.</p><p>Hepatitis A virus is more common in areas that lack adequate sanitation or have poor hygiene practices. The majority of people who acquire the illness have had personal contact with an infected person.</p><p>Community outbreaks have occurred as a result of drinking contaminated well water or eating contaminated food. In one report, hepatitis A virus was detected in well water six months after the initial contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-a-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hepatitis A virus can be acquired from contaminated food, usually raw shellfish that is harvested from contaminated water. Several outbreaks occurred as a result of eating contaminated green onions that were imported from Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-a-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS A SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis A virus usually causes a sudden and short-lived illness. The severity of symptoms depends upon the person's age; in children, there may be few or no symptoms. In adults, infection usually causes a mild flu-like illness. Less commonly in adults, hepatitis A virus infection causes liver failure, which can lead to death.</p><p>The time from infection to the development of symptoms is approximately 30 days, with a range of 15 to 49 days. Initial symptoms usually include fatigue, feeling run down, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, fever (temperature greater than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C), and pain under the ribs on the right side of the abdomen (where the liver is located) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>). As the illness progresses, other signs and symptoms develop, including dark-colored urine, light-colored stools, yellow-colored skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice), and itchy skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS A DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person is diagnosed with hepatitis A virus based upon their signs or symptoms, a physical examination, and blood testing. The blood test becomes positive about five days before symptoms appear and remains positive for about six months after infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS A TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for hepatitis A virus, although most people recover with supportive treatments at home, including rest. The amount of time needed to recover depends upon the individual; in general, the person should not return to work or school until the fever and jaundice have resolved and the appetite has returned.</p><p>During the recovery period, it is important to avoid drinking alcohol and taking certain prescription and over-the-counter medications (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">acetaminophen/Tylenol),</span> which can injure the liver. People who drink alcohol on a regular basis (eg, 7 to 14 drinks per week) should limit use of acetaminophen even if they have not been infected with hepatitis, due to the risk of liver injury.</p><p>Less commonly, people infected with hepatitis A virus require treatment in a hospital to monitor the liver function, manage complications such as bleeding, provide adequate nutrition, and, in rare cases, perform liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS A COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people feel better within three months of becoming infected with hepatitis A virus, and almost everyone completely recovers within six months. About 15 percent of people infected with hepatitis A virus will have prolonged or relapsing symptoms during the first six to nine months after being infected.</p><p>The most serious complication of hepatitis A virus infection is death. This occurs rarely but is more likely in adults with chronic liver infections such as hepatitis C and those who are older. Children die as a result of hepatitis A virus in less than 0.1 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis C (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unlike with other forms of hepatitis, people with hepatitis A do not develop chronic liver disease as a result of their infection. Once a person is infected with hepatitis A virus, it is not possible to become infected again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATITIS A PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis A virus infection is preventable with several strategies, discussed below. Hand washing is one of the most effective strategies for reducing transmission since the virus can live on the fingers for up to four hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hand hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hand washing is an essential and effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Hands should ideally be wet with water and plain or antimicrobial soap and rubbed together for 15 to 30 seconds. Special attention should be paid to the fingernails, between the fingers, and the wrists. Hands should be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a single-use towel.</p><p>It is not clear if alcohol-based hand rubs are effective against hepatitis A virus. For this reason, food handlers, daycare providers, travelers, and anyone else who is at risk of transmitting or becoming infected with HAV is advised to wash their hands with soap and water when possible. Alcohol-based hand rubs are a reasonable alternative if a sink is not available.</p><p>Hands should be cleaned after changing a diaper or touching any soiled item. They should also be washed before and after preparing food and eating, after going to the bathroom, and after handling garbage or dirty laundry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Safe food preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking precautions when preparing foods can reduce the risk of becoming ill. The following precautions have been recommended by the <a href=\"http://www.fsis.usda.gov/&amp;token=hIOpYdJrKWi3PWBYZCaPX3OXCcLqQ2H+GPVX9kEjZyEKBvq0rPiHjNsjmBM5rFMS&amp;TOPIC_ID=4572\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Food Safety and Inspection Services</a> and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that contain unpasteurized milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the refrigerator temperature at 40&ordm;F (4.4&ordm;C) or lower; the freezer at 0&ordm;F (-17.8&ordm;C) or lower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use precooked, perishable, or ready-to-eat food as soon as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry separate from other food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash hands, knives, and cutting boards after handling uncooked food, including produce and raw meat, fish, or poultry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources to a safe internal temperature: ground beef 160&ordm;F (71&ordm;C); chicken 170&ordm;F (77&ordm;C); turkey 180&ordm;F (82&ordm;C); pork 160&ordm;F (71&ordm;C).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cook chicken eggs thoroughly, until the yolk is firm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refrigerate foods promptly.

These precautions are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics#H5\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Food and water precautions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis A vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two vaccines are available to prevent infection with hepatitis A virus; the vaccines are called VAQTA and HAVRIX. Both are equally effective and protect nearly 100 percent of people who receive two doses for a lifetime. The initial dose of either vaccine usually provides adequate short-term protection, and the subsequent doses provide long-term protection. Thus, if a person does not have time to receive both doses before traveling, it is worth administering one dose and then completing the second 6 to 12 months later.</p><p>The most common side effect of the hepatitis A virus vaccine is brief redness or discomfort at the injection site.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VAQTA is given in two doses, with the second dose given 6 to 18 months after the first. This vaccine was temporarily recalled in the fall of 2001 because some prefilled syringes did not contain the proper amount of antigen to produce a reliable amount of antibody; this problem was subsequently corrected. People who were previously vaccinated against hepatitis A should contact their healthcare provider to determine which vaccine was given and if revaccination is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAVRIX is given in two doses, with the second dose given 6 to 12 months after the first.</p><p/><p>If the second dose is not given within the recommended time frame, it can be given without restarting the series. A vaccination series started with one brand of vaccine may be completed with the same or other brand of hepatitis A vaccine.</p><p>Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children between 12 and 23 months of age and those ages 2 to 18 who live in states or communities of high disease incidence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The hepatitis A virus vaccine is recommended for all <strong>at-risk adults</strong>, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travelers to countries where hepatitis A virus is common; the vaccine can be given at any time before traveling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection and non-injection illegal drug users</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men who have sex with men</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with chronic liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with blood clotting factor disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults who are at risk for infection at work, including daycare center staff, personnel in healthcare facilities (eg, nursing homes), and food handlers</p><p/><p>There is no information about the safety of the hepatitis A virus in pregnancy. However, the risk to the developing baby is likely to be low. Women who are at risk for hepatitis A and are pregnant should discuss the risks and benefits of the hepatitis A virus vaccine with their obstetrical healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals who are at risk for hepatitis A but who are allergic to components of the hepatitis A vaccine or who prefer not to receive the vaccine should consider taking a dose of immune globulin. Immune globulin is an injection that provides temporary protection against hepatitis A and reduces the risk of infection by more than 90 percent. However, the hepatitis A vaccine is preferred to immune globulin in most cases because it provides long-lasting protection and because immune globulin is not always available.</p><p>Immune globulin is given in a single injection shortly before travel. A single dose provides protection for about two months. Individuals who plan to travel for more than two months in areas where hepatitis A is endemic should have an additional dose(s) of immune globulin.</p><p>Older adults and people with a weakened immune system, chronic liver disease, or other underlying medical problem who plan to travel <strong>within two weeks</strong> should be given a dose of hepatitis A vaccine in addition to a dose of immune globulin. The second dose of the hepatitis A vaccine should be given 6 to 12 months later. Immune globulin is not required for healthy travelers who are immunized with the hepatitis A vaccine.</p><p>The timing of immune globulin relative to certain other vaccines is important. Immune globulin should be given at least two weeks after the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Conversely, the MMR vaccine should be given at least three months after immune globulin. The timing of immune globulin relative to other vaccines, including the yellow fever and poliovirus vaccine, is not important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AFTER EXPOSURE TO HEPATITIS A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a person is exposed to hepatitis A and has not previously received the hepatitis A vaccine, a dose of the vaccine or immune globulin should be given as soon as possible:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One dose of the vaccine is preferred for people aged 12 months to 40 years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One dose of immune globulin is preferred for people older than 40 years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are less than 12 months and people with a weakened immune system, chronic liver disease, and those who cannot tolerate the vaccine should be given one dose of immune globulin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postexposure treatment is not necessary for people who have previously been vaccinated with two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine.</p><p/><p>A description of the groups who require postexposure treatment is provided in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66335 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Close personal contact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anyone who lives with, has had sexual contact with, or shared intravenous drugs with a person who is diagnosed with hepatitis A should have postexposure treatment. The vaccine or immune globulin is suggested for anyone else who has had ongoing, frequent close personal contact (eg, a nanny) with an infected person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Child care centers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin is recommended for unvaccinated staff and children in a daycare center in some situations. A detailed explanation of the recommendation is provided in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66335 \">table 1</a>). The infected child or staff member should not return to daycare until the fever and jaundice have resolved and the appetite has returned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Common-source exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a person who handles food in a restaurant setting becomes infected with hepatitis A, all of his or her coworkers should be treated for hepatitis A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66335 \">table 1</a>). The infected food handler should not return to work until the fever and jaundice have resolved and the appetite has returned.</p><p>It is not usually necessary to treat people who have eaten at the restaurant, unless certain criteria are met; these are described in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66335 \">table 1</a>). However, adults and children who regularly eat at a school or work cafeteria that employs an infected food handler may be encouraged to have postexposure treatment; a healthcare provider should be consulted to determine if postexposure treatment is needed in these situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Schools and work settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a single child in elementary or secondary school becomes infected with hepatitis A, it is not usually necessary to treat his or her classmates if the infection was likely acquired outside the school (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66335 \">table 1</a>).
