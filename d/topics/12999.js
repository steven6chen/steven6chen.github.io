Patients may also suffer ischemic injury to the kidney due to interruptions in renal blood flow such as from cross-clamping of the renal artery during surgery for removal of renal cell carcinoma. This disorder is characterized by a rising plasma creatinine concentration, elevation in specific urine or serum biomarkers that are indicative of tubular injury such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a urine volume that may be reduced or normal, and a characteristic set of changes in the urinalysis, including many granular casts and a fractional excretion of sodium above 1 percent and fractional excretion of urea above 35 percent. Serum and urine biomarkers of tubular injury have been proposed as early biomarkers for the diagnosis of ATN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis and etiology of ischemic ATN will be reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The diagnosis of ATN, potential therapies for ischemic ATN, and other causes of ATN are discussed separately.

The major histologic changes in ATN are effacement and loss of proximal tubule brush border, patchy loss of tubule cells, focal areas of proximal tubule dilatation, distal tubule casts, and areas of cellular regeneration that appear during the phase of recovery of renal function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72453%7ENEPH%2F51526\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72453 graphicRef51526 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>However, the decline in renal function is usually more prominent than the severity of the histologic changes. In some cases, necrotic cell death is not readily apparent and is restricted to the outer medullary regions (including the S3 segment of the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle). In addition to observable tubule obstruction and cell death, other factors may contribute to the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubules from multiple nephrons drain into a single collecting tubule. As a result, obstruction in a relatively small number of collecting tubules may lead to failure of filtration in a large number of nephrons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of continued glomerular filtration and impaired proximal and loop reabsorptive function leads to increased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa in individual nephrons. This activates the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, causing afferent arteriolar constriction, which lowers the GFR in an attempt to reduce tubule flow rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back leak of filtered tubular fluid into the vascular space may occur across the damaged tubule epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apoptosis occurs in both proximal and distal tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritubular capillaries in the outer medulla may be congested with leukocyte accumulation that impairs local renal blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of processes contribute to the pathogenesis of ATN, including endothelial and epithelial cell injury, intratubular obstruction, changes in local microvascular blood flow, and immunologic or inflammatory processes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Endothelial and vascular components of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endothelium of the microcirculation of the kidney contributes to the pathogenesis of ATN. In human acute kidney injury (AKI) following renal transplantation, there is a 40 to 50 percent decrease in renal blood flow but a substantially greater decrease in GFR that is not accounted for by the decrease in renal blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In addition, regional blood flow is important in the pathogenesis of AKI. A disproportionate decrease in medullary blood flow relative to total renal blood flow results in medullary ischemia in AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Hypotension likely causes a reduction in renal blood flow in sepsis-induced AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, some experimental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] suggest an increase in renal blood flow, possibly related to changes in efferent arteriolar vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, changes in microvascular blood flow may contribute to decreased tissue oxygenation in ATN, especially in sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Sepsis'</a> below.)</p><p>Endothelial cell injury causes disruption in microvascular blood flow, which is important in the initiation and extension phase of ATN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>]. A reduction in microvascular blood flow contributes to decreased renal perfusion, renal hypoxia, epithelial cell ischemia, and a resultant decrease in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In particular, reductions in medullary blood flow may worsen the tubule damage caused by the initial ischemic insult. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epithelial cell injury and dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Disruption of the endothelial cell layer may lead to impaired vascular reactivity, increased vascular permeability, and leukocyte recruitment and activation. Activation of the endothelium by ischemic injury leads to upregulation of adhesion molecules such as intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and P-selectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These adhesion molecules facilitate leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions such as macrophage recruitment and elaboration of chemokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This recruitment of leukocytes serves as one of the early phases of inflammation after ischemia. The endothelial glycocalyx is a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins that covers the endothelium and contributes to its normal function. Damage to the endothelium results in loss of the glycocalyx and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Changes in the local microcirculatory blood flow may result from these changes and cause continued ischemia and tubular damage.</p><p>Dysfunction in the endothelial cell permeability barrier at the level of the peritubular capillaries probably contributes to the tubule backleak phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>]. Altered endothelial cell-cell contacts resulting in increased intercellular gap formation likely enhance microvascular permeability following ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Contributors to endothelial cell injury include the original ischemic insult, leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, and other inflammatory mediators (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF]). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Endothelial injury leads to hemodynamic alterations that worsen the initial ischemic insult. There is a local imbalance of vasoactive factors that favors the release of the potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin, along with the reduced release of vasodilatory nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Endothelial health depends on its interaction with mesenchymal progenitor cells (pericytes) in the interstitial compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Following ischemia-induced pericyte ablation, endothelial damage enhances focal hypoxia and tubular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1) is released from pericytes following ischemia, and reperfusion causes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;production in the extracellular space, enhancing the infiltration of neutrophils and worsening injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Integrins expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes bind to ligands that regulate vascular barrier integrity and may play a role in ischemia-reperfusion injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Altered coagulation and inflammation contribute to ischemic kidney injury. By inhibiting thrombin generation and activating protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), protein C may modulate endothelial dysfunction and protect against kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Thrombomodulin is an important factor in the anticoagulant protein C pathway and has anti-inflammatory properties. The administration of soluble thrombomodulin improved microvascular erythrocyte flow rates, reduced microvascular endothelial leukocyte rolling and attachment, minimized endothelial permeability, and reduced renal injury in an ischemic kidney injury model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Endothelial microparticles, which are 0.2 to 2 micrometers in diameter, are components of the endothelial cell membrane that retain cell membrane and intracellular molecules of parental cells including procoagulants and tissue factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These microparticles are thought to contribute to organ dysfunction in sepsis as adoptive transfer of microparticles from septic rats into healthy rats reproduced inflammatory and other septic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epithelial cell injury and dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ischemic damage in ATN is generally most severe in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule and in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/8,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,42</a>]. Early proximal tubule cells appear to be particularly susceptible to ischemia, while the renal medulla normally exists on the brink of hypoxia since the combination of low medullary blood flow and countercurrent exchange of oxygen lowers the pO<sub>2</sub> to 10 to 20 mmHg. This sensitivity to hypoxia may be exacerbated by endogenously produced nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Poor oxygenation leads to a variety of secondary factors that promote the development of tubule injury, including the intracellular accumulation of calcium, the generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of phospholipases and proteases, depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and apoptosis (programmed cell death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The net effect may be either cell death or the sloughing of viable cells into the tubule lumen by impairment of normal cell-to-basement membrane adhesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The latter process involves stress-induced redistribution of integrin receptors from the basolateral membrane, where adhesion to the matrix normally occurs, to the luminal membrane, where luminal integral receptors promote attachment to other dislodged cells causing intratubular obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A variety of other contributors to ischemic tubule injury or dysfunction have been explored in experimental models, but their contribution to human disease is undefined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia-induced redistribution of membrane proteins &ndash; Ischemia disrupts the actin cytoskeleton that anchors the Na-K-ATPase pump to the basolateral membrane, allowing some of the pumps to redistribute onto the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. This interferes with normal ion transport by pumping sodium back into the tubule lumen. Recovery of function is associated with the return of Na-K-ATPase pumps to the basolateral membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As mentioned above, beta-1 integrins are normally polarized to the basal cell membrane, where they maintain cell-substratum adhesion. Ischemic injury results in the redistribution of integrins to the apical membrane, with consequent shedding of tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The loss of epithelial polarity also leads to the loss of another basolateral membrane surface protein, the complement inhibitor, Crry, which permits activation of the alternative complement pathway, resulting in the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron-mediated oxidative stress is thought to contribute to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Mislocalized iron in the kidney occurs in experimental ischemia-reperfusion injury. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a kidney protein that induces renal cell differentiation and binds a siderophore that traps iron with high affinity. NGAL is induced in the kidney after ischemic injury, and the release of unbound iron that occurs as a consequence of ischemic injury can promote the formation of reactive oxygen species. The delivery of a lipocalin-siderophore-iron complex preserves renal histology in mice following ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In one study, ferroportin, an iron export protein, contributed to ischemia-reperfusion injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Hepcidin is an endogenous acute-phase hepatic hormone that binds and degrades ferroportin and attenuates AKI. Furthermore, hepcidin-deficient mice are more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells &ndash; The natural course of AKI is characterized by an initial phase of injury, followed by a later phase of resolution. The clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells is necessary to mitigate inflammation and initiate tissue repair. Although this role was thought to be exclusively due to macrophages, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1 or TIM-1), an immunoglobulin superfamily cell-surface protein that is highly upregulated on the surface of injured kidney epithelial cells, has been shown to recognize apoptotic cell surface-specific phosphatidylserine epitopes and confer properties of endogenous phagocytes to kidney epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellular receptors have been implicated in ischemia-reperfusion injury and recovery.

PPAR beta is ubiquitously expressed in the nephron, particularly in the straight proximal tubule. Mice deficient in PPAR beta are much more susceptible to ischemia, and providing a PPAR beta ligand protects against ischemic renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. PPAR gamma agonists, such as fibrates, reduce inflammation and injury following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

TLRs are expressed in both immune cells and renal epithelial cells and may serve as targets in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury. TLR 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are expressed in kidney epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]. The expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 by tubular epithelial cells is increased following ischemia in mice, and the reduction of either TLR2 or 4 expression reduces the generation of ischemia-induced cytokines and preserves renal function following ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/59,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,65</a>]. Renal TLR2 RNA is expressed primarily in tubule cells and appears to be linked to the release of cytokines in response to ischemic injury. Mice that are deficient in TLR2 demonstrate a reduction in cytokine release and renal dysfunction compared with mice that express TLR2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The expression of TLR4 on both immune cells and renal parenchymal cells contributes to AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. The endogenous ligand for TLRs may be heat-shock proteins-60 and -70, mammalian DNA, RNA, interferon alpha, interferon beta, CD40-L, or high mobility group box protein 1 (HMBG1), which are released by necrotic cells and ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">TLR9, an endosomal class of TLR, which is expressed in the spleen, may also contribute to the pathogenesis of AKI.

Pathogens are not the only agents that cause tissue damage. Tissue damage (eg, ischemia reperfusion) is recognized at the cell level via receptor-mediated detection of intracellular proteins released by the dead cells. These proteins are referred to as &quot;alarmin&quot; and include endogenous molecules that signal tissue and cell damage such as mammalian DNA, heat shock proteins, and HMBG1.

In some cases, surgical techniques require interruption of renal blood flow for short periods of time. Although most patients tolerate these changes well, some develop acute kidney injury (AKI) that is most often due to ATN. The likelihood of tubule injury is increased if there is an additional insult, such as exposure to nephrotoxins (including medications, pigments [hemoglobin or myoglobin]) or repeated hypotensive episodes. Nearly two-thirds of patients who develop ATN have been exposed to more than one nephrotoxic insult. Some data suggest that human kidneys can safely tolerate 30 to 60 minutes of clamp ischemia if other nephrologic insults are not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. This study prospectively analyzed the renal response to clamp ischemia in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy, with the majority of patients experiencing &gt;30 minutes of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Renal structural changes were much less severe than seen in animal models, and there was only a mild, transient increase in serum creatinine and biomarkers. The rise in these biomarkers did not correlate with the duration of ischemia or changes in renal function data.</p><p>There are three surgical procedures that seem to confer the highest risk for ATN:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, in which there may be periods of total renal ischemia if supra-aortic clamping is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/111,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,114</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to correct obstructive jaundice, in which the postoperative reduction in GFR is roughly twice as great (60 versus 30 percent) as that seen with other forms of abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

In normal subjects, endotoxin absorption is limited by the detergent effect of bile salts on the lipopolysaccharide endotoxin molecule; this protection is lost with obstructive jaundice since bile salt secretion is minimal. Preliminary experiments suggest that the administration of bile salts to such patients can prevent both the endotoxemia and the exaggerated renal vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac surgery, particularly coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with valve surgery.

Systemic hypotension, direct renal vasoconstriction, activation of vasoactive hormones (including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and endothelin), induction of nitric oxide synthase, release of cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, and chemokines), enhanced synthesis of reactive oxygen species, and activation of neutrophils by endotoxin and FMLP (a three-amino acid [fMet-Leu-Phe] chemotactic peptide in the bacterial cell walls) all may contribute to renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/17,121-126\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,121-126</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of processes contribute to the pathogenesis of tubular necrosis. These include endothelial and epithelial cell injury, intratubular obstruction, and immunologic or inflammatory processes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ATN is a common complication of severe ischemia (often due to prolonged hypotension), major surgery, or sepsis. ATN frequently occurs in combination with underlying comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For unclear reasons, ATN appears to be an unusual complication of heart failure, even at degrees of systemic hypotension that are associated with ATN in other circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Protective effect of heart failure and remote ischemic preconditioning'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Alge JL, Arthur JM.
