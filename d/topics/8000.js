McKinney Homeless Assistance Act defined a homeless person as someone who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and who lives in a shelter or a place not designed for human habitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2009, the Homelessness Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act expanded this definition to include people at imminent risk of housing loss within the next two weeks and people fleeing from domestic violence with inadequate resources to obtain other permanent housing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A chronically homeless person is defined by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as an individual with a disabling condition who has been either continuously homeless for at least one year or homeless at least four times in the past three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The phrase &quot;homeless people&quot; conveys a certain homogeneity that belies the remarkable diversity of this population. In our practice, homeless patients range from those who have spent their entire lives in poverty to those with advanced degrees and once-successful careers cut short by mental illness, addiction, personal tragedy, or bad luck.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245732217\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are several challenges to quantifying the number of homeless people in the United States, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimated that over 564,000 people were homeless on a single night in January 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of these, nearly 100,000 were chronically homeless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Projections of the number of homeless people over the course of a year are much higher given the dynamic nature of homelessness. Using data from the 1996 National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients, researchers from the Urban Institute have estimated that 2.3 to 3.5 million people in the United States experience homelessness in a year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. HUD has estimated that 1.49 million people used a homeless shelter at some point in 2014, but this estimate does not account for homeless individuals living in unsheltered circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Nationally, 69 percent of homeless people reside in emergency or transitional shelters and 31 percent live in unsheltered places [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There is some variation from city to city; warmer areas often have fewer homeless people who reside in shelters.</p><p>While the median age of an adult homeless person in the United States approaches 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], almost one-fourth of homeless people are children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. About 37 percent of sheltered homeless people are female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Homeless families represent 37 percent of the United States homeless population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Minority racial groups, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented among homeless people in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245732776\"><span class=\"h1\">MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have consistently documented mortality rates among homeless people that are higher than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/11-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-23</a>]. In a 1985 to 19 &#160;88 study of homeless people in Philadelphia, the age-adjusted mortality rate was 3.5-fold higher than in the general population of the city [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a 1991 to 2001 nationwide study of people residing in shelters, rooming houses, and hotels in Canada, the all-cause mortality rate exceeded that in the nation's lowest income quintile, suggesting that homelessness may confer health risks beyond those associated with poverty alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Mortality disparities are particularly stark among homeless youth and young adults, whose mortality rates are about 8- to 11-fold higher than in comparably aged non-homeless people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>]. A Danish study found that the life expectancy of 15- to 24-year-old homeless men was 22 years less than for men in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The most common causes of death among homeless adults have shifted over time but continue to reflect a heavy burden of addiction-related illness. A 1988 to 1993 study of homeless adults in Boston found that <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> was the leading cause of death among those aged 25 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Since then, a considerable decline in HIV-related deaths has been offset by significant increases in deaths due to drug overdose and substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Overall, more than one-half of all deaths among homeless people are attributable to tobacco, alcohol, or drug use, and drug-attributable mortality rates exceed those in the general population 8- to 17-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While drug overdose is the leading cause of death overall and accounts for one in three deaths among those under the age of 45 years, cancer and heart disease remain the predominant causes of death among older homeless individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558019\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homeless persons have higher rates of medical and psychiatric hospitalization and emergency department use compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/26-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-33</a>]. The pattern of acute care use among homeless people may be related to the high prevalence of substance use disorders and mental illness in addition to poor access to primary and preventive care services. Over one-half of homeless adults lack a usual source of health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Homeless people report a substantial burden of unmet need for basic health services, including medical care, prescription medications, mental health care, eyeglasses, and dental care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-40</a>]. Of those prescribed a medication, about one-fourth have difficulty adhering to it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12138014\" class=\"local\">'Substance use disorders'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12138038\" class=\"local\">'Mental illness'</a> below.)</p><p>Health insurance is a critical determinant of health care access for homeless people. Those with health insurance coverage are more likely to use ambulatory and non-hospital care services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/27,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,42</a>]. Compared with homeless people who have health insurance, uninsured homeless adults are more likely to report an unmet need for health care or prescription medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and are less likely to have a usual source of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. National studies suggest that about 60 percent of homeless people lack health insurance, although this figure may decrease under the Affordable Care Act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,35</a>]. However, evidence from Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/31,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,44</a>], the US Department of Veterans Affairs system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and Massachusetts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/32,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,45</a>] suggests that universal health insurance alone is unlikely to resolve the access problems or adverse utilization patterns of homeless people.</p><p>Additionally, homeless people who sometimes or often do not get enough food to eat are more likely to be medically or psychiatrically hospitalized and are more likely to be high users of emergency department services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>]. Individuals with high levels of difficulty in meeting their needs for food, shelter, clothing, and safety are less likely to have a usual care source and more likely to go without needed health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/34,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12137930\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON HEALTH CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of specific health conditions occur more frequently among homeless people; other conditions are seen with comparable frequency as in the general population but are often more poorly controlled.

Although homelessness presents unique health risks, the biology of illnesses and their treatment are fundamentally the same as in any other population and are covered in individual topic reviews.</p><p>For chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension, every effort should be made to adhere to evidence-based general population guidelines. However, the approach to providing care for homeless people may need to be modified to account for the extreme circumstances of their daily lives. For example, it may not be feasible or safe to aim for the recommended glycemic goals for diabetic patients or to initiate anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in patients with high stroke risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H15054361\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and target A1C'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outreach-based approach</strong> &ndash; Competing priorities for food, shelter, clothing, and safety often trump the perceived importance of routine health care for most homeless individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Thus, traditional clinical models that rely on patients presenting to care in a timely and self-guided fashion are suboptimal for this population. Instead, we suggest an outreach-based approach that embeds clinical services in the places that homeless people frequent by necessity: shelters, soup kitchens, and drop-in centers. A team-based street outreach model may be needed to reach those who avoid such services and sleep outside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Outreach interventions may improve access to care. A randomized trial in 185 homeless veterans found that compared with usual care, an outreach intervention with a personal health assessment and feedback to the patient using a motivational interviewing style <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a clinic orientation improved access to primary care at one and six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

We use a variety of low-pressure techniques for engaging the subset of people who are profoundly mistrustful. In such settings, we focus on tangible issues and we avoid medicalizing their concerns. Humane gestures that address basic subsistence needs, such as giving out socks or food vouchers, may be helpful, but we advise against giving out tobacco or alcohol to build trust. In many cases, we offer foot soaking and cleansing because this addresses an immediate need, inverts the traditional patient-clinician power dynamic, and conveys a service-oriented approach to care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma-informed approach</strong> &ndash; Given the pervasiveness of traumatic life experiences among homeless people, we use a trauma-informed approach throughout the care process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. In a primary care setting, trauma-informed care includes universal screening for histories of trauma, educating office staff to be sensitive to issues of physical and emotional boundaries, allowing patients to help dictate the pace and direction of history-taking, physical examination, and invasive diagnostic testing, and proceeding cautiously with assessments that may inadvertently re-traumatize patients (eg, pelvic examinations).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12138099\"><span class=\"h2\">History gathering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive history may not be feasible or even desirable during the initial clinical encounter, particularly among those who are guarded about engaging in care. More often than not, we gather the history incrementally over several visits while building rapport and trust. We advocate for a patient-centered approach to history gathering that allows patients to guide the pace and direction of initial health conversations.</p><p>In addition to a customary medical history, it is critical to document and update contact information, as this often changes. A large percentage of homeless people have cell phones, although their allotment of minutes may be limited and may fluctuate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/140-142\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-142</a>].</p><p>We pay particular attention to the social history as the patient allows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. We ask about where people sleep at night, with particular attention to distinguishing those who stay in sheltered locations from those who sleep &quot;rough&quot; in outdoor locations, since the latter group may be at particularly high risk for assault, exposure-related conditions, and other health complications. The moniker &quot;homeless&quot; may not be accepted by some people experiencing homelessness, so we prefer the approach of discussing episodes in and out of housing.</p><p>Special consideration should also be given to addressing current and past substance use as well as symptoms of mental illness. Specific screening tools may be helpful in eliciting this history.

When caring for patients with particularly severe trauma histories, we recommend an approach that openly narrates planned actions (&quot;Now I'm going to listen to your lungs.&quot;) and seeks permission for more sensitive assessments (&quot;Is it okay if I examine your belly?&quot;). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-testicular-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for testicular cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients may be reluctant to allow an examination because of shame about certain aspects of their appearance (eg, decayed teeth) or self-care (eg, malodorous feet). In these instances, we use normalizing language (&quot;I see bad teeth all the time; it doesn't bother me&quot;) and allow the patient to guide which aspects of the exam are acceptable.</p><p>Given the heavy burden of cognitive and functional impairments among homeless people, clinicians should consider screening for cognitive impairment and performing an office-based assessment of functioning and mobility, particularly in homeless persons &ge;50 years.

We preferentially rely on longer-acting insulin formulations that can be given once or twice daily (eg, NPH, detemir, or glargine), and we tend to avoid rapid-acting insulin regimens that require predictable eating schedules. Most types of insulin can be stored at room temperature for up to one month, but extremes of temperature should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concerns for medication abuse </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Consideration should be given to the street value of certain medications, although this should not overshadow an individual patient's medical needs.

Among 4679 homeless people with serious mental illness in New York City between 1989 and 1997, those who were placed in supportive housing (subsidized housing with onsite or linked supportive services, such as medical and psychiatric care and case management) had an 86 percent decrease in shelter use, 57 percent fewer inpatient psychiatric days, 80 percent fewer days spent in municipal hospitals, as well as fewer days spent in prison and jail (74 percent and 40 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. In another study of 160,525 homeless people who used the New York City shelter system between 1990 and 2002, those who entered housing had a lower mortality risk than those who remained homeless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].</p><p>The general approach to housing provision has been an area of some controversy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Linear models</strong> &ndash; Early housing models were largely based on a &quot;linear&quot; approach that made housing contingent upon abstinence from drugs and alcohol and progression through a continuum of treatment programming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/159-161\" class=\"abstract_t\">159-161</a>]. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials concluded that abstinence-contingent housing with or without day treatment programming consistently produced better drug abstinence rates than day treatment alone or usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Critics of the linear housing approach have questioned the basis for requiring abstinence or treatment engagement prior to housing entry as some studies have found minimal or no association between housing outcomes and program requirements for abstinence or residential treatment program completion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/160,163,164\" class=\"abstract_t\">160,163,164</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Housing First</strong> &ndash; In contrast to a linear housing approach, the &quot;Housing First&quot; approach uncouples the provision of housing from engagement in treatment services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/161,165\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,165</a>].

Similar to linear approaches, Housing First models often incorporate comprehensive support services from multidisciplinary teams of health and social service professionals. Studies of Housing First for homeless individuals demonstrate clear improvements in housing stability over usual care, but other benefits may depend on the specific population being studied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Pathways to Housing was a randomized controlled trial in homeless people with serious mental illness and comorbid substance use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. Compared with participants in the linear housing approach, those in the Housing First condition spent over twice as much time in stable housing, with no differences in substance use outcomes or psychiatric symptoms. In a quasi-experimental study of chronically homeless people with severe alcohol use disorders in Seattle, Housing First was associated with significant reductions in public service use and costs and alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/167,168\" class=\"abstract_t\">167,168</a>].

Among individuals with high support needs (n = 950), Housing First plus ACT resulted in greater improvements in residential stability, overall quality of life, and community functioning compared with usual care at one-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. The improvements in quality of life and community functioning were attenuated at two years but remained significant when averaged over the entire study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245735201\"><span class=\"h1\">TAILORED CARE MODELS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Health Care for the Homeless Program </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>In 1985, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Pew Charitable Trusts allocated funding for the original Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) Program in 19 cities across the country. With funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), this program was expanded in 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/175,176\" class=\"abstract_t\">175,176</a>]. Since then, the HCH program has grown to include more than 220 federal grantees that provide care to over 800,000 homeless persons annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">HCH programs vary greatly in their size and delivery models but share a common commitment to providing health care services that are tailored to meet the needs of homeless individuals and families. These programs generally seek to provide integrated, team-based care through co-located medical, mental health, and substance use treatment services. Core components of the HCH model include outreach and engagement, community collaborations, case management services, medical respite care, and guidance from consumer advisory boards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical respite care </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A signature concept of the HCH model is medical respite care, which provides a safe, sheltered, and medically supervised environment for the care of homeless individuals who are too medically compromised to be on the streets or in a shelter but not ill enough to merit acute care hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/179\" class=\"abstract_t\">179</a>]. Medical respite units are particularly well-suited to providing care to homeless individuals following hospital discharge, and in this setting they appear to reduce 90-day readmission rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/180\" class=\"abstract_t\">180</a>] as well as total hospital days over the ensuing 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>]. In practice, medical respite units are also useful venues for stabilizing poorly controlled chronic conditions such as diabetes, managing acute conditions such as influenza or cellulitis that may not require hospitalization, and providing supportive care surrounding ambulatory procedures such as colonoscopy or day surgeries such as herniorrhaphy. With the aging of the homeless population, increasing attention has turned toward end-of-life care for homeless people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-care-of-homeless-persons-in-the-united-states/abstract/182,183\" class=\"abstract_t\">182,183</a>], and medical respite programs could potentially play an important role in addressing this need as well.

An estimated 2.3 to 3.5 million people experience homelessness in a year. (See <a href=\"#H12137924\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H245732217\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality rates among homeless people are higher than in the general population. Drug overdose is the leading cause of death under the age of 45 years, while cancer and heart disease are the leading killers in adults 45 years and older. (See <a href=\"#H245732776\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homeless people have high rates of hospitalization and emergency department use but poor access to primary medical care and a high burden of unmet need for basic health services.

We use low-pressure techniques for engagement and allow the patient to dictate the pace of care, particularly for those who have experienced trauma. The treatment of illnesses in homeless people is the same as for non-homeless people, but the approach to care may need to be tailored to an individual's circumstances and resources. (See <a href=\"#H12138093\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We often take an incremental approach to the history and physical exam.
