It can be acute, subacute, or chronic, and there may be either focal or diffuse involvement of the myocardium. In symptomatic patients, the cardiac presentation is frequently one of acute heart failure (HF), although a syndrome mimicking acute myocardial infarction or a tachyarrhythmia, including sudden death, or high-grade heart block may occur. If the epicardium is involved, pericarditis may be associated with pleuritic chest pain and pericardial effusion. Isolated endomyocardial inflammation and fibrosis is seen in L&ouml;ffler's cardiomyopathy, tropical endomyocarditis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and some adverse drug reactions.</p><p>The etiology and pathogenesis of myocarditis will be reviewed here. Issues related to the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of myocarditis are discussed separately.

Among the infectious etiologies, viruses are the presumed most frequent pathogens, but bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In North America and Western Europe, the most frequently identified viruses were enteroviruses (including coxsackievirus) until the 1990s. Parvovirus B-19 and human herpes virus 6 are the viruses most frequently found. This topic review will focus on viral and hypersensitivity myocarditis. Many of the other causes of myocarditis are discussed in detail elsewhere in UpToDate.

In the 1960s, a link was suggested by seroepidemiologic studies between enteroviral infection, particularly coxsackievirus, and human myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Since that time, approximately 20 viruses have been implicated in human myocarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56995 \">table 1</a>). Molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization, have permitted the direct detection of viral genomes in the hearts of patients with acute myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infection, defined as the presence of viral genomes in heart biopsy specimens, is commonly associated with myocarditis in series from Western Europe and North America.

The most common viral genomes identified in patients with suspected myocarditis are human herpes virus 6 and parvovirus B19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/14,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25,26</a>]. Enterovirus still causes myocarditis in small regional outbreaks. H1N1 influenza A infection may cause fulminant myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In the civilian vaccination program, the incidence of myocarditis with or without associated pericarditis was 1.3 per 10,000 vaccinees if only probable cases are included and 5.5 per 10,000 vaccinees if suspected cases are included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The lower rate in military vaccinees could reflect a highly selected fit population without underlying disease.

The study included 624 patients, age 1 day to 42 years (mean 6.2 years), with acute HF or cardiovascular collapse and an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) positive for myocarditis by the Dallas criteria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Dallas criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Cultures were obtained from blood, urine, stool, nasopharynx, and EMB specimens. Serial serologies were obtained, and PCR was performed on blood and cardiac tissue to identify viral nucleic acid. An additional 149 patients had acute HF with a negative EMB and were diagnosed with new onset dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM); 165 control patients with other cardiac disorders were also evaluated. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serology, cultures, and PCR (of cardiac tissue) each detected a viral pathogen in approximately one-third of myocarditis patients; PCR detected a pathogen in 20 percent of DCM patients and only 1.4 percent of controls. Blood samples were positive by PCR in only 1 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In case series, parvovirus 19 has been commonly detected by PCR from myocardial biopsy specimens in patients with acute and chronic dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/14,22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22,31</a>]. </p><p/><p>The PCR findings should not be interpreted as providing a definitive diagnosis of the cause of myocarditis cases, since intercurrent or previous viral infection unrelated to the episode of myocarditis cannot be ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, among patients who had both positive peripheral cultures and a positive PCR, the results were in agreement in only 76 percent of cases. Despite these concerns, these data suggest that viral pathogens are commonly associated with histologic evidence of myocarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence and prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of idiopathic or &quot;viral&quot; myocarditis in the general population is unknown. In early studies, cardiac involvement was suspected to occur in 3.5 to 5 percent of patients during outbreaks of Coxsackievirus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/15,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32,33</a>]. However, there is significant difficulty in establishing a diagnosis of myocarditis because EMB, the diagnostic reference technique, is infrequently used and there is no established noninvasive &quot;gold standard.&quot; Furthermore, the sensitivity of EMB, which may reveal a lymphocytic infiltrate, sometimes with evidence of myocardial damage, may be as low as 35 percent by conventional histology (Dallas criteria), although immunohistochemistry and viral PCR have yielded higher sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/13,14,17,21,24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,17,21,24,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Endomyocardial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Autopsy studies have revealed varying estimates on the incidence of myocarditis that vary with the population studied. In a registry of 1866 young athletes who died suddenly, 6 percent had myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A 5 percent prevalence of active myocarditis was reported in a high-risk group of 186 sudden, unexpected medical deaths in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Myocarditis is responsible for approximately 2 percent of infant, 5 percent of childhood, and 5 to 12 percent of young athlete sudden cardiovascular death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Other reports have evaluated the prevalence of myocarditis as a cause of initially unexplained DCM. In a review of 1230 such patients, myocarditis as defined by the Dallas criteria was felt to be responsible in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and myocarditis was identified in 10 percent in the over 2200 patients with unexplained HF of less than two years duration in the Myocarditis Treatment Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Certain groups appear to be at increased risk for fulminant viral myocarditis. As an example, children, especially neonates and those who are immunocompromised, may have a severe illness with hemodynamic compromise. In one series, lymphocytic myocarditis was present in 25 of 62 children with dilated cardiomyopathy (40 percent) who underwent cardiac histologic examination within two months of presentation with dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Protective effect of initial immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By age 30, between 18 and 94 percent of people have antibodies to one or more coxsackie B virus serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. It is likely that this humoral response soon after infection is beneficial, acting to decrease inflammation. </p><p>Compatible with the beneficial effect of the initial immune response is the observation from the Myocarditis Treatment Trial Investigators that findings consistent with a stronger humoral and cellular immune response were associated with less severe initial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Supporting this concept, immune deficient mice develop a severe myocarditis between 7 and 14 days after inoculation with a high subsequent mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Among the factors that may be protective in the initial immune response are regulatory T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], natural killer (NK) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], and interferon beta and interferon gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. In a transgenic mouse model in which the pancreatic beta cells express interferon gamma, the spread of an infecting virus is reduced, and infection with coxsackievirus B3 does not produce myocarditis as it does in normal mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a mouse strain lacking the interferon beta gene, susceptibility to coxsackievirus B3 is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Role of cytokines'</a> below.)</p><p>These data, which come almost entirely from animal models, suggest the importance of reducing the level of viremia early during infection. If, however, the initial immune response is insufficient, persisting and possibly replication deficient viruses may drive an adverse autoimmune immune response or directly cause myocyte damage. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune mechanisms'</a> below.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Giant cell myocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis is a rare, severe, virus-negative, and frequently fatal type of autoimmune myocarditis that may respond to immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This disorder has been attributed to T lymphocyte-mediated inflammation and is associated with systemic autoimmune disorder in approximately 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. In an animal model, a disorder similar to giant cell myocarditis was induced by immunization with cardiac myosin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Giant cell myocarditis recurs in the native heart of 12 percent of patients followed for an average of 5.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypersensitivity myocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity myocarditis (HSM, a form of eosinophilic myocarditis) is an autoimmune reaction in the heart that is often drug-related and is usually characterized by acute rash, fever, peripheral eosinophilia, and ECG abnormalities such as nonspecific ST segment changes or infarct patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. However, some patients present with sudden death or rapidly progressive HF. The true incidence of HSM is unknown. One estimate comes from an autopsy study, which identified 16 cases in more than three thousand consecutive autopsies (&lt;0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In other series, the prevalence of clinically undetected HSM in explanted hearts ranged from 2.4 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>HSM is usually temporally related to a recently initiated medication. Numerous drugs have been implicated in this drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, including methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, ampicillin, tetracycline, azithromycin, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. However, HSM does not always develop early in the course of drug use. As an example, patients taking the antipsychotic agent clozapine have been reported to develop myocarditis more than two years after the drug was started [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Eosinophilic myocarditis has also been seen in 2.4 to 23 percent of patients treated with dobutamine infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-67</a>]. It is uncertain whether this reaction represents hypersensitivity to the drug itself or a reaction to sodium bisulfite, which is a preservative in many dobutamine preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/63,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,65</a>]. It has been diagnosed either on EMB or retrospectively after explantation of the native heart. In some cases, tapering or discontinuation of dobutamine infusion has resulted in diminution of the peripheral eosinophilia and histologic improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Histologically, HSM is usually characterized by an interstitial infiltrate with prominent eosinophils, but little myocyte necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, occasional patients with apparent drug hypersensitivity have giant cell myocarditis, granulomatous myocarditis, or necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. These disorders can usually be distinguished from hypersensitivity myocarditis only by EMB.

In one review, 187 consecutive patients with myocarditis were screened for IgA antiendomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies; patients with a positive test underwent duodenal endoscopy and biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nine patients (4.8 percent) had celiac disease, compared with 1 of 306 controls (0.3 percent).

Five patients had progressive HF that failed to respond to more than six months of conventional HF therapy; they were then treated with immunosuppression and a gluten-free diet with a marked improvement in symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; absolute 18 to 35 percent increase). Although spontaneous improvement is common in patients with myocarditis, these patients had failed a prolonged course of standard therapy.</p><p/><p>In a study of 45 children with celiac disease, subclinical systolic dysfunction was present in those children who had high titers of antiendomysial antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Autoimmune disorders occur with increased frequency in patients with celiac disease and may be related in part to antigen overload resulting from increased intestinal permeability.

ARVC is associated with a fatty appearance of the RV free wall; the fibrofatty replacement of the RV myocardium initially produces typical regional RV paradoxical wall motion abnormalities, which later become global, producing RV dilation. The condition is often familial.

The initial change is myocyte damage in the absence of a cellular immune response. The myocyte injury may be mediated through direct viral toxicity, perforin-mediated cell lysis, and cytokine expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracellular events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral entry into the myocyte is mediated by cell surface receptors. The coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a common receptor for coxsackievirus type B and for adenovirus subgroups A, C, D, E, and F [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>]. The CAR gene has been localized to chromosome 21q11.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. With rare exceptions, CAR expression is required for virus entry into cells. Observations have established the role for a dominant negative C terminal dystrophin fragment in viral cardiomyopathy and added a new pathway and potential therapeutic target in viral myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>The discovery of the CAR receptor raises the possibility of interventional therapy to block CAR in severe cases of coxsackie B virus or adenoviral myocarditis. Coreceptors, including decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) for some coxsackie B virus strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>] and integrins, help determine the efficiency of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. The activity of signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes also may determine susceptibility to coxsackie B myocarditis via effects on viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>After entry into the cell through the CAR receptor, the coxsackie B viral genome is translated into structural capsid proteins and several proteases that cleave the viral polyprotein. Viral protease 2A can also cleave certain host proteins, and one mechanism of ongoing myocyte injury is through direct interaction of viral proteins with the cytoskeleton. In a transgenic mouse model, cardiac-restricted expression of protease 2A was sufficient to induce dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Protease 2A cleaves dystrophin in vivo, leading to disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that is essential for normal cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

CD4-positive T cells produce myocyte damage by stimulating B cells, cytotoxic cytokines, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.

Gene transfer of IL-10 can protect against autoimmune myocarditis in rats, probably by suppressing the early Th1 type response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. However, in one study of patients with myocarditis of unspecified etiology, higher serum levels of IL-10 were associated with greater disease severity and higher mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myocarditis and DCM in a few animal and human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-other-hormones-cytokines-and-chemokines-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nitric oxide, other hormones, cytokines, and chemokines in heart failure&quot;</a>). Support for the role of TNFa in myocarditis comes from a study of transgenic mice with myocardial expression of TNFa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Production of this cytokine by cardiac myocytes was sufficient to cause severe cardiac disease, including transmural myocarditis and ultimately biventricular fibrosis, chamber dilatation, and LV dysfunction. In addition, there is a strong linear relationship between mortality and TNFa levels in a mouse model of HF due to viral myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>].</p><p>In human myocarditis, endomyocardial biopsy specimens show higher levels of a TNFa precursor and the TNFa converting enzyme (TACE), which converts the precursor to its mature form within the myocytes and interstitial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. TACE and TNFa expression were greater in patients with NYHA class III and IV HF than in those in NYHA class I and II, and increased expression was correlated positively with LV volume and negatively with LV systolic function. However, the clinical importance of TNFa in DCM remains uncertain as randomized trials of anti-TNFa therapy have failed to show benefit. Cytokine expression profiles should be studied in human <span class=\"nowrap\">myocarditis/DCM</span> of defined viral versus autoimmune pathogenesis prior to translating results from experimental models to the clinical arena.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The two models do not exclude each other, and may account for the progression from myocarditis to DCM in distinct patient subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-myocarditis/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The first phase is comprised of viral infection with myocyte death within hours of viral cell entry.

Non-genetically susceptible animals and humans recover with few consequences. In genetically susceptible experimental animals and humans, a breakdown of T cell tolerance to self-myocardial autoantigens (eg, cardiac myosin) ensues. This leads to chronic myocardial inflammation, <span class=\"nowrap\">necrosis/apoptosis,</span> and fibrosis mediated by humoral (Autoantibody-mediated) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cell-mediated organ-specific autoimmunity.
