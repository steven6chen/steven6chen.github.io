Because of their inhibitory effects on multiple types of immune cells, glucocorticoids are remarkably efficacious in managing many of the acute disease manifestations of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids upon the various effector cells of the immune system, as well as the effect of glucocorticoids on infection risk and vaccination, will be reviewed here. The effects of glucocorticoids on other specific physiologic systems are presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-nervous-system-and-behavior\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid effects on the nervous system and behavior&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids diffuse passively across the cellular membrane and bind to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor. Binding of the drug to this receptor creates a complex, which then translocates into the nucleus, where it can interact directly with specific DNA sequences (glucocorticoid-responsive elements [GREs]) and other transcription factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on gene transcription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Binding of the receptor to GREs may result in either enhancement or suppression of transcription of susceptible downstream genes. The anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids result from the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Binding to and blocking promoter sites of proinflammatory genes, such as interleukin-1-alpha (IL-1-alpha) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recruiting of transcription factors to promoter sequences of genes coding for anti-inflammatory gene products including I-kappa-B-alpha, IL-1 receptor-II (IL-1RII), lipocortin-1 (annexin 1), interleukin-10 (IL-10), alpha-2-macroglobulin, and secretory leukocyte-protease inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of the synthesis of almost all known inflammatory cytokines. This is primarily achieved by competing for or blocking the function of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) that are required for transcription of proinflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/3,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-8</a>]. This may be mediated in part by glucocorticoid-induced expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 and consequent dephosphorylation of various proteins that participate in intracellular signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These include Jun N-terminal kinase (interfering with production of c-Jun and AP-1), extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2, and p38 MAPK. Glucocorticoids increase the synthesis of I-kappa-B-alpha, a protein that traps and thereby inactivates NF-kB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on post-translational events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to their effects on gene transcription, glucocorticoids also inhibit secretion of inflammatory cytokines by affecting post-translational events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The stability of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is diminished in the presence of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Noted consequences of the effects of glucocorticoids on gene transcription include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upregulating the synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral-endopeptidase enzymes that degrade bradykinin, which is a vasodilatory peptide central to the generation of some forms of angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppressing production of inflammatory eicosanoids in phagocytic cells by inducing the synthesis of lipocortin-1 (annexin 1), macrocortin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lipomodulin, all of which inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated liberation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppressing the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase primarily responsible for production of prostaglandins at sites of tissue injury and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This effect primarily results from glucocorticoid suppression of NF-kB transcription. Glucocorticoids do not appear to affect the synthesis of constitutive cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3615069610\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSE RANGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some immunologic effects of glucocorticoids are dose-dependent, due primarily to variable affinity of target genomic sites for the complex of glucocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor. High-affinity genomic sites may be affected by low levels of glucocorticoids, with additional genes affected as the concentration of glucocorticoid increases. Administration of high-dose pulse glucocorticoids may result in nonspecific general disruption of gene transcription. High-dose pulse glucocorticoids may also have more rapid effects on leukocyte aggregation, possibly as a consequence of effects on the expression of leukocyte-adhesion molecules and disruption of calcium flux across membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Individuals differ in their susceptibility to the therapeutic and adverse effects of glucocorticoids. The proposed mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity are reviewed separately.

Equivalent doses of other glucocorticoids are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F111230\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111230 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H426081090\"><span class=\"h2\">Higher doses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunologic effects of high-dose, short-term pulse therapy have also been studied. In vitro, lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens was maximally suppressed at concentrations of glucocorticoid that would be achieved by the administration of approximately 1 gram of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The acute effects of 1 gram of intravenous methylprednisolone in vivo were evaluated in a small study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were given either one or three daily doses of methylprednisolone (1 gram per dose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Lymphopenia developed within 2 hours of the dose, peaked at 6 hours, and resolved by 24 hours with both regimens. Patients were followed for 16 weeks, during which skin test positivity to purified protein derivative (PPD) was unaffected, serum immunoglobulin levels were unchanged, and primary antibody responses to antigens were normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS ON IMMUNE CELLS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3739728875\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in the complete blood count and differential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of glucocorticoids predictably results in a neutrophilic leukocytosis. The timeframe in which neutrophilia is observed is inversely proportional to the administered dose, with elevated leucocyte counts noted within four hours following the initiation of treatment with moderate-to-high doses of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H4284737640\" class=\"local\">'Phagocytes'</a> below.)</p><p>In some patients, particularly neonates exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> antenatally, there may be a slight increase in the percentage of bands on the differential blood count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the appearance of immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood differential is noted only rarely in adult patients following glucocorticoid administration. As such, the presence of bands or other immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood of adult patients is best presumed to be evidence of intercurrent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]..</p><p>Changes in other cell lines include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of even low doses of glucocorticoids leads to dramatic reductions in circulating eosinophils.

Entry to sites of infection and tissue injury is impaired, resulting in suppression of the inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Reduction in endothelial adhesion may be due to direct effects of glucocorticoids on expression of adhesion molecules on both leukocytes and endothelial cells, as well as indirect effects due to the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on transcription of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which upregulate endothelial adhesion molecule expression. The normal process of leukocyte-endothelial adhesion during inflammation is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the pathogenesis of inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4284737640\"><span class=\"h3\">Phagocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phagocytes are a critical component of the innate immune response, and glucocorticoids affect the functions of various phagocytic cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Neutrophils</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main impact of glucocorticoid treatment on neutrophil function is impairment of migration to sites of inflammation or infection. Neutrophil migration through the vasculature to sites of inflammation is severely impaired. This, combined with enhanced release of cells from the bone marrow and inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis, results in increased numbers of circulating neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>].</p><p>In contrast to migration, neutrophil phagocytic responses or bactericidal activities do not appear to be significantly impaired at low-to-moderate doses of glucocorticoids, although at high doses, phagocytic function may be inhibited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Monocytes and macrophages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids diminish the production of <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage-derived</span> eicosanoids and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF), and also inhibit macrophage phagocytic and microbicidal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/24,25,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,32,33</a>]. Clearance of opsonized bacteria by the reticuloendothelial system is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. There is reduced elaboration of macrophage migration inhibition factor and decreased expression of adhesion molecules required for transmigration, resulting in reduced accumulation of monocytes and macrophages in the tissues and a slight increase in circulating levels of these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Antigen presentation and expression of class II human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules by macrophages is downregulated in response to glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This effect, coupled with the effect of glucocorticoids on dendritic cells, may account for the significant impact of glucocorticoids on acquired immunity. However, a number of macrophage effector functions that are associated with inflammatory disorders appear to be refractory to or may actually increase in the context of treatment with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Most notable among these are the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and the secretion of chemokines (including CCL5, CXCL1, and CXCL2) involved in leucocyte recruitment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This observation may partly account for the limited efficacy of glucocorticoids in managing macrophage-mediated disorders, such as Erdheim-Chester disease, fibrotic lung disease, or macrophage activation syndromes. The effects of glucocorticoids on dendritic cells are discussed more below.

However, in a study examining acute effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> administration on lymphocyte subsets, numbers of immature NK cells were noted to decrease, whereas numbers of mature NK cells increased. Notably, sustained upregulation of NK cell activation genes including <em>KIR3DL2</em>, <em>KLRC3</em>, <em>KLRD1</em>, and <em>GPR56</em> were observed as early as one hour after hydrocortisone infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/23,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,39</a>].

Based a limited number of studies performed in the 1970s, levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) may decrease by 10 to 20 percent over the first few weeks of treatment with moderate-to-high dose glucocorticoids given short-term, then return to normal over weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>].

Entry to sites of infection and tissue injury is impaired, resulting in suppression of the inflammatory response. (See <a href=\"#H2509252092\" class=\"local\">'Leukocyte trafficking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutrophil phagocytic responses or bactericidal activities do not appear to be significantly impaired at low-to-moderate doses of glucocorticoids, although at high doses, phagocytic function may be inhibited. Glucocorticoids impair a variety of T cell functions and induce T cell apoptosis. B cells are less affected, and antibody production is largely preserved, although a mild-to-moderate decrement in immunoglobulin G (IgG) may develop in some patients with high doses given acutely and with chronic use. (See <a href=\"#H2585707515\" class=\"local\">'Changes in cell function and survival'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'B cells and immunoglobulin levels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic glucocorticoid therapy is associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of infection. Patients are most often affected by common viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. Opportunistic infections are less common and are mainly a concern in patients taking other immunosuppressive agents or with diseases causing immunocompromise. In contrast to systemic therapy, inhaled and topical corticosteroids are usually not implicated in increased risk of infections. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Infection risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Live vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving glucocorticoids. A possible exception is the zoster vaccine, which is recommended for certain groups of patients receiving low-dose glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H1864167363\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of live vaccines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responses to vaccines are preserved in most patients on chronic low-to-moderate doses of glucocorticoids for renal, pulmonary, or rheumatologic diseases, although the titers may be reduced in some individuals. In contrast, vaccine response may not be adequate in patients who are seriously ill, have malignancies, or are immediately post-transplantation.
