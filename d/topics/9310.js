Some of these organisms are primarily human pathogens, while others have animals as their natural hosts but can also cause human infection.</p><p>Taeniasis, diphyllobothriasis, hymenolepiasis, and dipylidiasis<em> </em>will be reviewed here. Ingestion of the eggs of <em>Taenia solium</em> causes cysticercosis, a tapeworm infection that is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30381309\"><span class=\"h1\">MORPHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult tapeworms consist of a head, neck, and segmented body. The head (also known as a scolex) is equipped with suckers, hooks, or grooves (depending upon the species); the worm uses these to attach itself to the intestine of the host.</p><p>Each segment (known as a proglottid) has a complete set of reproductive organs. Depending on the species, the adult worm may have hundreds or thousands of proglottids. In some species (such as <em>Taenia</em>), the distal segments can separate from the rest of the body, and the proglottids (or the eggs they contain) are passed in the stool. In other species (such as <em>Hymenolepis</em>), proglottids degenerate within the host so only eggs are found in the stool.</p><p>Tapeworms are covered with a tegument through which they absorb nutrients and secrete waste. Different species of tapeworms can be differentiated by morphologic characteristics of the scolex, proglottids, and eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30381316\"><span class=\"h1\">INTESTINAL TAPEWORMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Taeniasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main species of <em>Taenia</em> for which humans are the only definitive hosts. These are <em>Taenia saginata</em>, the beef tapeworm, and <em>Taenia solium</em>, the pork tapeworm. <em>T. saginata </em>occurs worldwide but is most common in areas where consumption of undercooked beef is customary, such as Europe and parts of Asia. The third species, <em>T. asiatica</em>, is found among pigs in Taiwan, Korea, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Concurrent infections with more than one <em>Taenia</em> species have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Issues related to <em>T. saginata</em> are discussed here. The epidemiology, transmission, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cysticercosis due to <em>T. solium</em> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are the only definitive hosts for <em>T. saginata</em>, <em>T. solium</em>, and <em>T. asiatica </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64879 \">figure 1</a>). Eggs or gravid proglottids are passed in human stool; eggs can survive for days to months in the environment. Cattle (<em>T. saginata</em>) and pigs (<em>T. solium</em> and <em>T. asiatica</em>) become infected by ingesting vegetation contaminated with eggs or gravid proglottids. In the animal's intestine, the oncospheres hatch, invade the intestinal wall, and migrate hematogenously to striated muscles, where they develop into cysticerci. Cysticercus contains protoscolices; they usually measure 5 by 10 mm and can survive for several years in the animal.</p><p>Humans become infected by ingesting raw or undercooked infected meat containing cysticerci. In the human intestine, protoscolices are released from the cysts and attach to the intestinal wall via suckers and hooks. Each protoscolex can become the head of an adult tapeworm, which develops by forming proglottids that arise from the caudal end of the scolex; this occurs over about two months, and the adult tapeworm can survive for years in the small intestine. Most human infections are with only one or a few adult tapeworms.</p><p>The length of an adult worm is usually &le;5 m for <em>T. saginata</em> (however, it may reach up to 25 m) and 2 to 7 m for <em>T. solium</em>. The adult worms produce proglottids that mature, become gravid, detach from the tapeworm, and are passed in the stool (approximately six per day). <em>T. saginata </em>adult worms usually have 1000 to 2000 proglottids, while <em>T. solium</em> adult worms have an average of 1000 proglottids. The eggs in the gravid proglottids are released after the proglottids are passed in the stool. <em>T. saginata</em> may produce up to 100,000 eggs per proglottid, and <em>T. solium</em> may produce 50,000 eggs per proglottid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most human carriers of adult tapeworms are asymptomatic. Intermittently, patients may pass proglottids in the stool (<em>T. solium</em>) or spontaneously (<em>T. saginata</em>) or may notice segments in their stool or sense the movement of proglottids through the anus. There may be associated symptoms including nausea, anorexia, or epigastric pain. Anxiety, headache, dizziness, and urticaria can also occur. A peripheral eosinophilia (up 15 percent) may be observed.</p><p>Occasionally, segments can enter the appendix, common bile duct, or pancreatic duct and cause obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Rarely, proglottids can be aspirated or regurgitated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is generally established by identifying eggs or proglottids in the stool. The eggs of <em>Taenia</em> species are morphologically indistinguishable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59510\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59510 \">picture 1</a>); they are round with a double-walled, radially striated membrane and measure 30 to 40 micrometers. <em>T. saginata</em> eggs have an acid-fast shell; <em>T. solium</em> eggs are not acid fast.</p><p>The proglottids and scolices of <em>T. solium</em> and <em>T. saginata </em>are morphologically distinguishable and can be used to establish a species diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78855 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62252\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62252 \">picture 3</a>). The <em>T. saginata</em> proglottids have 12 or more primary uterine branches; <em>T. solium</em> proglottids have &le;10. These branches can be seen on direct examination or by injecting India ink into the segment via its lateral genital opening.</p><p>The scolex usually remains in the intestine when proglottids are passed; it is rare for the entire worm to be eliminated spontaneously. Following antiparasitic therapy, however, the scolex of a fully evacuated worm may be identified in the stool. <em>T. saginata</em> has a scolex with four lateral suckers and no hooks (&quot;unarmed&quot;). <em>T. solium</em> has a scolex with a well-developed rostellum (crown) that has four suckers and a double row of hooks (&quot;armed&quot;).</p><p>The sensitivity of stool examination is limited since elimination of eggs and proglottids is intermittent. To increase the diagnostic yield, repeat specimens should be examined, and concentration techniques can be used. In addition, <em>T. saginata</em> eggs may be deposited on perianal areas and be detected by anal swabs.</p><p>Laboratory workers must exercise caution when performing stool examinations; <em>T. solium</em> eggs are infectious if ingested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunologic and molecular methods have been developed to improve diagnostic sensitivity, including an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of <em>T. solium</em> antigens in fecal samples and DNA hybridization techniques for the detection of eggs in stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. In addition, several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting various genomic regions have been developed for distinguishing between species of human <em>Taenia</em> infections, including PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], species-specific DNA probes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], and <span class=\"nowrap\">nested/multiplex</span> PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. Primers targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (<em>cox1</em>) gene of the three <em>Taenia</em> species have been developed and show promise for more routine use to distinguish between the three <em>Taenia</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In general, these assays are not yet suitable for routine diagnosis or field studies and are not widely available.</p><p>Diagnosis of taeniasis has also been made by visualizing the worm on capsule endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diphyllobothriasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diphyllobothriasis (fish tapeworm) is the largest human tapeworm. The most common species worldwide is <em>Diphyllobothrium latum</em>, which is observed predominantly in northern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Japan but has also been observed in other countries. Freshwater fish infected with <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> larvae may be transported to and consumed in areas where active transmission does not occur. For example, cases of <em>D. latum</em> infection associated with consumption of imported fish have been reported in Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Other species include <em>D. pacificum</em> (mainly Peru, also Chile and Ecuador [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]), <em>D. dentriticum</em> (especially Alaska), <em>D. nihonkaiense</em> (Korea, Japan, and China), and <em>D. ursi</em> (Alaska and Canada).</p><p><em>D. latum</em> infection can be transmitted by consumption of a variety of freshwater fish. Individuals who eat various forms of raw fish, such as sushi, sashimi, and ceviche, are at risk of infection.</p><p>Humans are the main definitive host for <em>D. latum</em> and the most important reservoir of infection. Some other <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> species primarily infect birds or mammals and are less common causes of human infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adult parasites live in the human intestinal tract, and eggs and proglottids are passed in the stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72572\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72572 \">figure 2</a>). Under appropriate conditions, the eggs embryonate in water (after approximately 18 to 20 days); coracidia hatch from eggs and are ingested by small crustaceans (the first intermediate host).</p><p>The coracidia develop into procercoid larvae in the body cavity of the infected crustacean, which is then ingested by small freshwater fish (the second intermediate host), typically minnows. The procercoid larvae are released from the crustacean and migrate into the fish flesh where they develop into a plerocercoid larvae (sparganum). The sparganum are the infective stage for humans. Since humans do not generally eat undercooked minnows or other small freshwater fish, these do not represent an important source of infection. These small freshwater fish are eaten by larger predator species (later intermediate host), such as trout, perch, or pike.</p><p>The sparganum can migrate from the small fish to the musculature of the larger predator fish; humans and other mammals can acquire infection by eating these predator fish raw or undercooked. After human ingestion of the infected fish, the sparganum develop into mature adult tapeworms that reside in the small intestine. The <em>D. latum</em> adult worms attach to the intestinal mucosa via the two bilateral groves of their scolex. The adults can grow up to 12 m in length, with 3000 to 4000 proglottids. Immature eggs are released from the proglottids (up to one million eggs per day per worm) and are intermittently passed in the stool beginning five to six weeks after infection. The adult tapeworm survives for approximately 10 years in the human intestine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals with diphyllobothriasis are asymptomatic. Occasionally, a proglottid can be passed in the stool or regurgitated, but this occurs less commonly than with <em>Taenia</em> species. Nonspecific symptoms that have been attributed to infection include fatigue, diarrhea, numbness, dizziness, and allergic symptoms. Occasionally, mechanical obstruction of the intestine can occur if several worms become entangled. A peripheral eosinophilia (5 to 10 percent) may be observed in some patients.</p><p>The classical manifestation of infection with <em>D. latum</em> is megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. <em>D. latum</em> has a unique affinity for vitamin B12 and therefore competes with the host for absorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency is more likely to develop if the host had marginal levels before acquiring the infection. It has been reported that approximately 40 percent of infected individuals have low vitamin B12 levels, but only about 2 percent actually develop anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the setting of severe vitamin B12 deficiency, pancytopenia, glossitis, dyspnea, and neurologic abnormalities (subacute combined spinal and peripheral nerve degeneration) can develop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Megaloblastic anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency can be a clue to the diagnosis of diphyllobothriasis.</p><p>The diagnosis is generally established by identifying eggs or proglottids in the stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50301\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50301 \">picture 4</a>). The eggs of <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> species have an operculum, or lid-like opening, which is commonly seen in trematode eggs but is not seen with eggs of other cestodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59791\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59791 \">picture 5</a>). The eggs measure 40 by 60 mcm and have a small knob on the end opposite the operculum. Concentration methods are not necessary for diagnosis in most cases, since there are typically large numbers of eggs present in the stool.</p><p>The scolex of the adult is spoon shaped and has characteristic ventral sucking grooves (known as &quot;bothria&quot;) with which the worm attaches to the intestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The proglottids can be differentiated from <em>Taenia</em> proglottids because their width is greater than length, and there is a characteristic egg-filled uterus that appears as a dark rosette in the center of mature proglottids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50903 \">picture 6</a>). It is generally difficult to distinguish among the species of <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> based on morphology. Molecular methods may be used to differentiate between <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Occasionally, <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> species may be visualized on colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Hymenolepiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Hymenolepis nana</em> (dwarf tapeworm) differs from most other tapeworms since it can complete its entire life cycle in a single host (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53545\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53545 \">figure 3</a>). Its name derives from the fact that the adult parasite is much smaller than most other cestodes, measuring only 30 to 40 mm by 1 mm. <em>H. nana</em> is the most common human tapeworm infection worldwide. Transmission is associated with poor sanitation and hygiene and can occur between humans in the absence of an intermediate host. It is especially prevalent in warm countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Thailand, India, and Latin American countries. It has been reported to affect 4 percent of schoolchildren in rural southeastern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3887034\"><span class=\"h3\">Life cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eggs of <em>H. nana</em> are immediately infective when passed in the stool and cannot survive more than 10 days in the external environment. Humans may ingest these eggs via contaminated food or water; thereafter, the oncospheres within the eggs are released and penetrate the intestinal villus where they develop into cysticercoid larvae. After five to six days, these develop into adult tapeworms that attach to the ileum via the scolex, which consists of four suckers and a retractable rostellum with a single circle of 20 to 30 hooks. Production of new eggs begins approximately 20 to 30 days after initial infection; eggs are passed in the stool when released from proglottids or when proglottids disintegrate in the small intestine.</p><p>Internal autoinfection is also possible; eggs can release their oncospheres within the human intestine, continuing the infective cycle without passage through the external environment. The lifespan of adult worms is four to six weeks, but internal autoinfection allows the infection to persist for years.</p><p>Alternatively, the eggs passed in the stool may be ingested by an arthropod intermediate host (various species of beetles and fleas may serve as intermediate hosts). Cysticercoid larvae develop within the insect, which are then ingested by humans or rodents and develop into adult worms in the small intestine. Humans can become infected by ingesting the infected insects accidentally, often in contaminated grain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection with <em>H. nana</em> is most common in children, since they are more prone to breaches in fecal-oral hygiene. Most infections are asymptomatic, but symptoms become more common as the parasite burden increases. Heavy infections with &gt;1000 worms can occur and are often associated with crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, fatigue, and pruritus ani. Dizziness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and seizures have also been described. A peripheral blood eosinophilia of 5 to 10 percent may be observed.</p><p>Malignant transformation of <em>H. nana</em> has been described in an HIV-infected patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Further study of host-parasite interactions is needed to better understand the potential relationships between infection and cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is generally established by identifying eggs or proglottids in the stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72451\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72451 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62695\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62695 \">picture 8</a>). Eggs are 30 to 50 mcm in diameter. They contain an oncosphere and are covered with a thin hyaline outer membrane and a thick inner membrane; four to eight hair-like filaments arise from the even-thicker polar ends of the membrane. Proglottids disintegrate in the intestine and are not found in the feces. The sensitivity of stool microscopy can be increased by using concentration techniques such as the FLOTAC method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis of hymenolepiasis should prompt family screening or empiric treatment, given the potential for person-to-person spread.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tapeworms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Hymenolepis diminuta</em> is a species related to <em>H. nana</em> that is primarily a parasite of domestic rats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74543 \">figure 4</a>). Humans can be infected as accidental hosts by swallowing infected insects, such as grain beetles or mealworms (intermediate hosts), usually in flour or cereals. Infection occurs mainly in areas with heavy rodent infestation. The worms and the eggs are morphologically different from <em>H. nana</em>, but similar symptoms can develop.</p><p>The dog tapeworm, <em>Dipylidium caninum</em>, commonly infects domestic cats and dogs and may also accidentally infect humans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53612 \">figure 5</a>). Fleas usually serve as the intermediate hosts and contain cysticercoids. If an animal or human (usually a child) ingests cysticercoids, an adult tapeworm can develop in the intestine. Infection is usually asymptomatic; abdominal pain, diarrhea, pruritus ani, and urticaria can develop. Parents may notice the passage of proglottids in their children's stool. The adult tapeworm is 15 to 20 cm in length.</p><p>Some cestodes only infect humans in the larval stage, including sparganosis due to <em>Spirometra</em> species and coenuriasis due to <em>Taenia multiceps</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Praziquantel</a> is the treatment of choice for all of the tapeworm infections discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-tapeworms/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

With large tapeworms, such as <em>Taenia </em>and <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> species, intact or disintegrating segments and eggs may be passed for several days. Following therapy, stools should be rechecked for eggs at one month (hymenolepiasis or diphyllobothriasis) or three months (taeniasis) to document cure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050569769\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures for prevention of intestinal tapeworm infection include avoiding ingestion of undercooked beef <em>(T. saginata)</em>, undercooked pork (<em>T. solium</em>), raw freshwater fish (<em>D. latum</em>), or contaminated vegetables, water, or grains (<em>H. nana</em>).</p><p>Cooking meat at temperatures of at least 145&deg;F (63&deg;C) kills tapeworm eggs and larvae, as does freezing meat and fish at -4&deg;F (-20&deg;C) or below for 7 days, or deep freezing at -31&deg;F (-35&deg;C) or below for 12 to 24 hours.</p><p>Hand washing with soap and water before eating or handling food and after using the toilet or touching animals is also recommended to reduce the risks of tapeworm infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12131100\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tapeworms (cestodes) are flat, hermaphroditic worms that can live as parasites in the human gastrointestinal tract. Some of these organisms are primarily human pathogens, while others have animals as their natural hosts but can also cause human infection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Taenia saginata</em> occurs worldwide but is most common in areas where consumption of undercooked beef is customary, such as Europe and parts of Asia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64879 \">figure 1</a>). Most human carriers of adult tapeworms are asymptomatic; there may be associated symptoms, including nausea, anorexia, or epigastric pain, and a peripheral eosinophilia may be observed. The diagnosis is generally established by identifying eggs or proglottids in the stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59510\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59510 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Taeniasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Diphyllobothrium latum</em> is the most common species of fish tapeworm worldwide; it is observed predominantly in northern Europe and Japan but has also been observed in other countries. <em>D. latum</em> infection can be transmitted by consumption of a variety of raw freshwater fish (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72572\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72572 \">figure 2</a>). Megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency is a classical manifestation of infection. The diagnosis is generally established by identifying eggs or proglottids in the stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50301\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50301 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diphyllobothriasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Hymenolepis nana</em> can be transmitted between humans in the absence of an intermediate host or via an alternative life cycle including rodents and arthropods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74543 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53545\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53545 \">figure 3</a>). It is associated with poor sanitation and is prevalent in warm regions including Egypt, Sudan, Thailand, India, and Latin American countries. Infection is most common in children. Most infections are asymptomatic, but heavy infection may be associated with crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, and pruritus ani. The diagnosis is generally established by identifying eggs or proglottids in the stool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62695\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62695 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72451\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72451 \">picture 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Hymenolepiasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">praziquantel</a> for treatment of infection due to <em>T. saginata</em>, <em>D. latum</em>, and <em>H. nana</em> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Dosing depends on the species. Niclosamide is an acceptable alternative treatment if praziquantel is not available. Following therapy, stools should be rechecked for eggs to document cure.
