Originally described in 1907 as a subepicardial structure located at the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava, the SA node represents the integrated activity of pacemaker cells in a compact region of the right atrium that depolarize and produce action potentials almost synchronously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. While the location of the primary pacemaker may move among groups of cells within the region of the SA node, only about 1 percent of the cells in the SA node act as the leading pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is the term used to describe the inability of the SA node to generate a heart rate that meets the physiologic needs of an individual. The initial clues to the diagnosis of SSS are often derived from taking the history and obtaining a routine electrocardiogram (ECG), though the symptoms and ECG findings are frequently vague and nonspecific. The diagnostic evaluation should initially include a search for remediable causes of SA nodal depression such as drugs (eg, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>) and metabolic diseases (eg, hypothyroidism). Treatment of SSS is directed at symptoms and typically involves the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. </p><p>The epidemiology, potential etiologies, and the natural history of SSS will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, approach to diagnosis, and the treatment of SSS are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20741334\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SA NODE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440351940\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pacemaking activity that originates from the sinoatrial (SA) node is incompletely understood. There are two predominant mechanisms that are thought to serve as the initiation of sinus activity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The funny current (I<sub>f</sub>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous intracellular calcium release by sarcoplasmic reticulum</p><p/><p>The I<sub>f</sub> current is the result of sodium and potassium ionic currents that allow for a steady increase in the resting membrane potential of the cell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 1</a>). Once the resting membrane reaches the depolarization threshold of the cell, an action potential is generated, and electrical activity ensues. The rate of the steady increase of the resting membrane potential can be modulated by other ionic currents as well as beta-adrenergic activity. As the slope of the increase in resting membrane potential steepens, the rate of spontaneous sinus node activity increases. </p><p>The second mechanism thought to be critical in SA node activity initiation is spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release within the SA nodal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The release of calcium into the intracellular space results in activation of the sodium-calcium exchange current, eventually leading to phase 4 depolarization. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and evidence suggests that they may be complementary in their pacemaking actions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;, section on 'Action potential in slow response tissues'</a>.)</p><p>While the calcium and potassium currents are the predominant determinants of SA nodal automaticity, there is evidence to suggest that the sodium channel may also play a role. Mutations in the human cardiac sodium channel (<em>SCN5A</em>) cause one type of long-QT syndrome (LQT3), and these individuals may also have sinus pauses and sinus bradycardia in addition to the characteristic prolongation of the QT interval. Studies in cells expressing either wild type or LQT3 channels showed that an increase in a persistent inward current in the mutated channels reduced the sinus rate directly and could also result in the failure to repolarize completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;, section on 'LQT type 3'</a>.)</p><p>As mentioned above, pacemaking can originate from different areas within the sinus node. Mapping of sinus node activation indicates that at faster rates, the SA impulse originates in the superior portion of the SA node, or extranodally, while at slower rates, it arises from the inferior portion of the node or, once again, extranodally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The SA node may be insulated from the surrounding atrial myocytes except at a limited number of preferential exit sites. Shifting pacemaker sites may select different exit pathways to the atria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20741346\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic nervous system and the SA node</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SA node is innervated by the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous systems, and the balance between these systems controls the pacemaker rate. The classic concept has been that of a reciprocally balanced relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. More recent investigations, however, stress dynamic, demand-oriented interactions and the anatomic distribution of fibers that allows both autonomic systems to act quite selectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Muscarinic cholinergic and beta-1 adrenergic receptors are non-uniformly distributed in the SA node and modulate both the rate of depolarization and propagation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20741352\"><span class=\"h3\">Parasympathetic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parasympathetic input via the vagus nerves <strong>decreases</strong> the SA nodal pacemaker and is the dominant input at rest. The mediator of parasympathetic activity is acetylcholine (ACh) which, as a ligand gating agent, acts through the G-protein, G<sub>i</sub>, to activate a certain group of membrane channels called I<sub>KACh</sub> channels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 1</a>) in tissues of the SA and atrioventricular (AV) nodes as well as of the atria, Purkinje fibers, and ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Acetylcholine increases the outward potassium current, thereby slowing the SA nodal pacemaker, by at least two important mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resting potential and the maximum diastolic potential become more negative; as a result, more current is required to reach threshold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outward potassium current opposes the inward currents responsible for depolarizing the cell, resulting in a decrease in phase 4 depolarization. </p><p/><p>Acetylcholine also reduces the inward calcium current, I<sub>Ca</sub> through the G-protein system. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20741358\"><span class=\"h3\">Sympathetic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sympathetic nerve input, as well as the adrenal medullary release of catecholamines, <strong>increases</strong> the sinus rate during exercise and stress. The manner in which beta-receptor stimulation by catecholamines affects automaticity is complex and involves interactions of the <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-receptor/adenylate</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">cyclase/G-protein</span> systems. Catecholamines enhance the L-type of inward calcium current by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and activating the protein kinase A system; the increment in inward calcium current would be expected to increase the rate of phase 4 diastolic depolarization. The redistribution of calcium may also increase the completeness and the rate of I<sub>K</sub> deactivation. Catecholamines may also enhance I<sub>f</sub>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440352043\"><span class=\"h2\">SA nodal remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial tachyarrhythmias can cause persistent changes in atrial electrophysiology that result in increased vulnerability to further dysrhythmia. This phenomenon is called &quot;atrial remodeling.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation#H186295411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Electrical remodeling'</a>.)</p><p>The SA node may also undergo electrophysiologic changes in response to atrial arrhythmias or other stimuli (see bullets below); these changes result in SA node dysfunction and are referred to as &quot;SA nodal remodeling&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Remodeling of the SA node may also occur in the setting of heart failure, even in the absence of a history of atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a study of 18 patients with symptomatic heart failure and 18 age-matched controls, those with heart failure had significant prolongation of the intrinsic sinus cycle length, corrected sinus node recovery time, and sinoatrial conduction time, as well as caudal displacement of sinus activity and an increase in the number and duration of fractionated atrial electrograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>After ablation for atrial fibrillation, reverse remodeling of the SA node may occur with elimination of the SA node depression and the prolonged sinus pauses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Reverse remodeling of SA nodal function also occurs after the termination of atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and after the catheter ablation of right atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As little as 10 to 15 minutes of atrial pacing causes SA nodal remodeling in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Interestingly, asynchronous ventricular pacing has also been associated with SA nodal remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440353214\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF SSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is characterized by dysfunction of the sinoatrial (SA) node that is often secondary to senescence of the node and surrounding atrial myocardium. The term &quot;sick sinus syndrome&quot; was first used in 1967 to describe the sluggish return of SA nodal activity in some patients following electrical cardioversion and is now commonly used to describe the inability of the SA node to generate a heart rate that meets the physiologic needs of an individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Numerous electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities can result in SSS, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus bradycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus pauses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus arrest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SA nodal exit block</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate heart rate response to physiological demands during activity (chronotropic incompetence)</p><p/><p>SSS can also be accompanied by supraventricular tachycardias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia) as part of the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome.

However, patients with symptomatic SSS are generally older (ie, seventh or eighth decade of life) with frequent comorbid diseases. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a pooled analysis of 20,572 patients from two large epidemiology studies (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] and Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS]) who were followed for an average of 17 years, 291 incident cases of SSS were noted, yielding in an incidence rate of 0.8 cases per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. While several variables were associated with development of SSS (eg, higher body mass index, hypertension, prior cardiovascular event), advancing age was the most significant risk factor for SSS (hazard ratio 1.73 for each additional five years of age; 95% CI 1.47-2.05).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In three major trials of pacing in this disorder, the median or mean age was 73 to 76 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Men and women appear equally affected, and although less common, SSS can occur in younger adults and children.

Local cardiac pathology, systemic diseases that involve the heart, and <span class=\"nowrap\">medications/toxins</span> can all be responsible for abnormal SA node function and result in SSS.</p><p>Abnormal automaticity, or sinus arrest, refers to a failure of sinus impulse generation. Abnormal conduction, or sinoatrial delay or block, is a failure of impulse transmission. In such cases, the sinus impulse is generated normally, but it is abnormally conducted to the neighboring atrial tissue. Both abnormal automaticity and abnormal conduction may result from one of several different mechanisms including fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/infiltrative</span> myocardial processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinus node fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of sick sinus syndrome is the replacement of sinus node tissue by fibrous tissue, which may be accompanied by degeneration and fibrosis of other parts of the conduction system as well, including the atrioventricular (AV) node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

In one cohort of 52 patients with sick sinus syndrome who presented with sinus bradycardia associated with sinoatrial (SA) block or SA arrest, it took an average of 13 years (range 7 to 29 years) for progression to complete SA arrest and an escape rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial arrhythmias and conduction disturbances become more common over time, possibly the result of a progressive pathological process that affects the entire atrium and other parts of the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/27,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,63,64</a>]. As an example, among 213 patients with a history of symptomatic SSS who were treated with atrial pacing and followed for a median of five years, 7 percent developed atrial fibrillation and 8.5 percent developed high-grade atrioventricular block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SSS, particularly those with alternating tachycardia and bradycardia, are at an increased risk for thromboembolic events even after pacemaker implantation. A possible contributor to cardiovascular events after pacemaker implantation is asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation resulting in thromboembolic events.

In one study of 19,893 persons from two prospective cohorts without atrial fibrillation or a pacemaker at baseline who were followed for an average of 17 years, 213 persons developed SSS (0.6 events per 1000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. While the development of SSS was associated with a significantly higher mortality, this association was attenuated following adjustment for incident cardiovascular disease during follow-up. While SSS certainly contributes to patient morbidity, if or how SSS increases overall mortality is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Parasympathetic input via the vagus nerves <strong>decreases</strong> the SA nodal pacemaker and is the dominant input at rest, while sympathetic nerve input, as well as the adrenal medullary release of catecholamines, <strong>increase</strong> the sinus rate during exercise and stress. (See <a href=\"#H20741346\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic nervous system and the SA node'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is characterized by dysfunction of the sinoatrial (SA) node that is often secondary to senescence of the SA node and surrounding atrial myocardium. Medications may also contribute and can often unmask subclinical sinoatrial dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H440353214\" class=\"local\">'Definition of SSS'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H26360131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidemiology of SSS is difficult to study, given the nature of SSS and its varying manifestations, but patients with symptomatic SSS are generally older (ie, seventh or eighth decade of life) with frequent comorbid diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinoatrial (SA) node dysfunction occurs as a result of disorders in automaticity, conduction, or both. Sinus node fibrosis is the most common cause of SSS, although medications and toxins as well as systemic diseases that involve the heart can also be responsible for abnormal SA node function and result in SSS. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of SSS typically involves intermittent but progressive cardiac rhythm disorders, which have been associated with higher rates of other cardiovascular events and higher mortality. There is a tendency for the rhythm disturbances associated with SSS to evolve over time, along with a higher likelihood of thromboembolic events and other cardiovascular events.
