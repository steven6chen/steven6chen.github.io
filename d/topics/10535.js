In most patients, the disorder is managed with careful skin care practices, topical therapies for inflammation, and the elimination of exacerbating factors. Patients with severe disease that fails to improve with conventional therapy may benefit from second-line therapies, such as phototherapy or systemic medications.</p><p>This topic reviews the causes and treatment of severe, refractory AD in children. The standard management of AD, including maintenance of skin hydration, control of pruritus, topical anti-inflammatory therapies, and management of infection, is discussed separately. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AD and the role of allergy in AD are also discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF SEVERE ATOPIC DERMATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with AD have mild to moderate disease. However, a subpopulation of patients develops severe symptoms. Severe AD may be loosely described as the presence of widespread skin lesions, unremitting itching, or physically or emotionally disabling disease that significantly compromises a patient's quality of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80481\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80481 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F116080\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116080 \">picture 2</a>). Patients with severe AD that does not respond to first-line topical therapies may be classified as having severe, refractory disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3801860382\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical studies have utilized scales for defining the severity of AD, such as the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although such scales are useful for standardizing the results of research studies, they are not routinely used in clinical practice. Moreover, these measures may not reflect the disease severity as perceived by the individual patients. The Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), a fully patient-derived and patient-assessed scale, has been proposed as a core instrument to complement the clinician-assessed scales in the evaluation of disease severity and response to treatment in patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160; </p><p>An international study involving over 1000 patients or parents of children with AD from 34 countries found that the symptoms considered to be important by 80 percent of the participants included itch, <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/soreness,</span> skin feeling hot or inflamed, bleeding, involvement of visible or sensitive body sites, cracks, sleep difficulties, amount of the body affected, and <span class=\"nowrap\">weeping/oozing</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A practical guide to visual assessment of eczema severity that also includes the evaluation of disease impact on quality of life and psychosocial well-being has been proposed by the <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg57/resources/atopic-eczema-in-under-12s-diagnosis-and-management-975512529349&amp;token=4DwsUnU+yHseZwT+XceADKRry+zhx8AIAeZ7oX0Y9mNCuaHR8zOg7aAVuNNwt88wJcgoZtIaOmtNFJZ683tRqMbt6zSqShVDvt0tisJaQ//+sKLWThTsIML+YegtifgPKwTUOrO4iKktYDPZFMEFNQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1726\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; Areas of dry skin, infrequent itching (with or without small areas of redness); little impact on everyday activities, sleep, and psychosocial well-being.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; Areas of dry skin, frequent itching, redness (with or without excoriation and localized skin thickening); moderate impact on everyday activities and psychosocial well-being, frequently disturbed sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe &ndash; Widespread areas of dry skin, incessant itching, redness (with or without excoriation, extensive skin thickening, bleeding, oozing, cracking, and alteration of pigmentation); severe limitation of everyday activities and psychosocial functioning, nightly loss of sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL CAUSES OF REFRACTORY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circumstances that may contribute to severe or refractory AD include poor compliance or incorrect use of medications, presence of environmental exacerbating factors, secondary infection, and hypersensitivity reactions to topical treatments or other allergens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66729 \">table 1</a>). Prior to initiating second-line treatments for AD, clinicians should ensure that severe, refractory disease is not a result of the presence of an avoidable or treatable factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Poor compliance/incorrect medication use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many patients, a lack of adherence to the treatment regimen and basic skin care techniques contributes to persistent disease. Over 50 percent of patients with AD do not administer treatment as recommended by their clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Specific reasons for inadequate application of treatment include concerns about medication side effects, patient dislike of topical preparations, and insufficient time for clinicians to educate patients about skin care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Topical corticosteroid phobia, defined as a concern or fear about using topical corticosteroids, is common, with a prevalence among patients and caregivers ranging from 20 to over 80 percent worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Corticosteroid phobia is likely a contributing cause of poor adherence to treatment and treatment failure among patients with AD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H921686810\"><span class=\"h2\">Exacerbating factors/environmental triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiating second-line treatments for AD, clinicians should ensure that severe, refractory disease is not a result of the presence of an avoidable or treatable exacerbating factor. Circumstances that may contribute to severe or refractory AD include noncompliance with conventional therapy, secondary infection, hypersensitivity reactions to topical treatments, and exposure to triggers of disease flares.</p><p>Exacerbating factors for AD may include low humidity environments, xerosis (dry skin), overheating of skin, emotional stress, and exposure to irritating substances, such as harsh chemicals or soaps. Avoiding these factors is helpful for avoiding acute flares as well as for long-term management, although this is not always possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AD are at an increased risk for secondary cutaneous bacterial, viral, and dermatophyte infections. The possibility of secondary infection should be considered in patients with skin lesions that appear refractory to conventional therapy. In particular, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Colonization with <em>S. aureus</em> occurs more frequently in individuals with AD than in the general population, and <em>S. aureus</em> is a common cause of secondary infection in these patients. The presence of purulence or honey-colored crusts suggests <em>S. aureus</em> infection. Even in the absence of overt infection, colonization by <em>S. aureus</em> may be an exacerbating factor for AD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Secondary HSV infection (eczema herpeticum) may also occur and, rarely, may lead to life-threatening dissemination of HSV in patients with AD. Punched-out erosions, hemorrhagic crusts, and vesicles are indicators of this infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypersensitivity reactions to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed hypersensitivity reactions to contact allergens in topical emollients or medications are another cause of an apparent lack of response to treatment. Allergic contact dermatitis can be caused by vehicles or active ingredients in emollients (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanolin</a>, propylene glycol, ethylenediamine, formaldehyde), topical immunosuppressive medications (eg, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors), and topical antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>].</p><p>Contact allergy to a topical emollient, medication, or other allergen (eg, nickel) should be considered when patients present with AD that fails to respond to, or appears to worsen, with these therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The identification and elimination of a contact allergen can lead to clinical improvement in affected individuals. If a contact allergy is suspected, patch testing should be performed to identify the responsible allergen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermatitis-eczema#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Allergic contact dermatitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contact-dermatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contact dermatitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Food and environmental allergies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, patients with refractory AD may have undiagnosed food or environmental allergies that are worsening their disease. It is therefore important to exclude immediate and delayed hypersensitivity through allergy testing (skin prick testing, specific immunoglobulin E [IgE] measurement, and patch testing). The role of allergy in AD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Incorrect diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An incorrect diagnosis may account for a failure to respond to conventional therapy. The possibility of other disorders that may present with clinical features that resemble AD should be considered. These may include conditions such as cutaneous T cell lymphoma, autoimmune disorders, and nutritional or immune system deficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50324 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199440171\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with refractory AD should be seen by a specialist (eg, dermatologist, allergist) familiar with second-line treatments, such as phototherapy and systemic immunosuppressive agents. Because of the paucity of randomized trials addressing the management of refractory AD in the pediatric age group, there is a wide variability among clinicians in the use of second-line therapies for children with severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a European survey conducted among consultant members of pediatric dermatology societies and special interest groups, including dermatologists (90 percent) and pediatricians (10 percent), 71 percent of the respondents used systemic immunosuppressive therapy for children with severe AD; most of them stated that their choice of systemic therapies and dosing regimens would be the same for young children and for older children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> was the first-line agent of choice (43 percent), followed by systemic corticosteroids (31 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (22 percent). Cyclosporine was the most commonly used second-line agent (34 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> the most commonly used third-line systemic treatment (26 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar survey performed in the United States and Canada among members of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology found that 86 percent of clinicians used systemic treatments for severe pediatric AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The first-line systemic agents were <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, used by 45 percent of participants, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (30 percent). The most commonly chosen second-line agents were methotrexate (31 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (30 percent), whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> was the most commonly used third-line agent (33 percent) followed by mycophenolate mofetil (24 percent). Only 5 percent of clinicians reported using oral corticosteroids as first-line treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167974147\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123823584\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because most of the second-line therapies for AD have potential adverse effects and nearly all are off-label for this indication in children, patients should be selected for these treatments only when conventional topical therapy does not provide sufficient improvement. Thus, after excluding the factors potentially associated with recalcitrant disease, we attempt a more intensive topical treatment with wet wraps for several days (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Potential causes of refractory disease'</a> above). This will help identify those children who are candidates for second-line therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036932978\"><span class=\"h3\">Wet wraps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children with persistent, severe AD despite optimal treatment with topical corticosteroids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> topical calcineurin inhibitors and for children with an acute, generalized exacerbation of AD, we suggest wet wrap therapy with diluted medium-potency topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 3</a>) once to twice daily for 2 to 14 days. Wet wraps can be maintained for two or more hours, as tolerated, and even overnight if patients feel comfortable. Wet wraps can also be applied for a shorter time (eg, 15 to 30 minutes) two or three times per day. </p><p>Wet wraps consist of a bottom wet layer and top dry layer. They are generally applied on top of emollients or topical corticosteroids and left in place for up to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cotton clothing in two layers may be sufficient for some cases, but elasticated cotton tubular bandages of appropriate size, which can be cut to cover any part of the body, may be more convenient in some situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Special bodysuits for wet wrap therapy for infants and toddlers are also commercially available.</p><p>Because of the increased systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids with wet wraps, some experts suggested that diluting low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids in emollients (eg, 1:19 for face and body in infants and young children) and limiting the duration of treatment to a few days may reduce the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Measurement of early morning fasting serum cortisol before and after treatment may be used to assess systemic absorption, although it is not generally performed for short-term use.</p><p>Data on the efficacy of wet wraps are sparse and inconsistent, due to a wide variability across studies in the treatment modality (eg, type of bandage used, frequency of application, treatment duration) and patient characteristics (eg, AD severity, body area involved) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While several observational studies and a few small randomized trials support their efficacy as a short-term treatment (2 to 14 days) to induce a rapid remission in children with severe disease, other studies suggest that wet wraps are as effective as conventional treatment with topical corticosteroids and emollients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/23,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,29</a>]. Adverse effects include increased systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids, general discomfort, chills, and folliculitis. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids resulting in undetectable levels of early morning fasting serum cortisol was reported in one study using wet wraps continuously for four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4202261460\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-line therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3146995939\"><span class=\"h3\">Phototherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For older children (eg, older than six years who can cooperate with treatment) and adolescents with refractory AD that does not respond to the more intensive topical regimen with wet wraps, we suggest phototherapy with narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), if feasible. Narrowband UVB is usually administered three times per week, with a progressive protocol that increases the dose with each treatment, as tolerated. The patient is usually reassessed after 20 to 25 treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband#H10844520\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVB therapy (broadband and narrowband)&quot;, section on 'Dosimetry and treatment protocols'</a>.) </p><p>Because of its favorable safety profile and wide availability, narrowband UVB is a more appropriate initial choice than other forms of phototherapy (eg, ultraviolet A1 [UVA1], psoralens plus ultraviolet A [PUVA], broadband UVB) for the treatment of severe, refractory AD in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uva1-phototherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVA1 phototherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Data on the efficacy of narrowband UVB phototherapy in children with AD are limited to a few retrospective case series and one prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. In a small study, 77 children (age 4 to 16 years) with psoriasis or AD were treated with narrowband UVB phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of 25 children with AD, 17 achieved minimal residual disease after a median of 24 treatments. In another retrospective study, 50 children with severe AD received more than 10 exposures to narrowband UVB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Complete clearance or good improvement was reported in 30 children.</p><p>Data on the short- and long-term safety of narrowband UVB phototherapy in children are sparse.

There are no studies evaluating the carcinogenic risk of phototherapy in children with AD. Although a systematic review of four studies assessing the risk of skin cancer among adults and children with psoriasis treated with narrowband UVB did not find an increased risk of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer, patients receiving narrowband UVB phototherapy should be monitored with yearly skin examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3506841804\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children and adolescents with refractory AD for whom phototherapy is not accessible or impractical, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is our first-choice immunosuppressive agent.

Before initiating second-line treatments for AD, factors potentially associated with recalcitrant diseases should be assessed and treated. These include poor adherence to treatment, presence of environmental triggers or allergens, infected eczema, and incorrect diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Potential causes of refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because most of the second-line therapies for AD have potential adverse effects and nearly all are off-label for this indication in children, patients should be selected for these treatments only when conventional topical therapy does not provide sufficient improvement. (See <a href=\"#H123823584\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with persistent, severe AD or acute, generalized exacerbation of AD, we suggest wet wrap therapy with diluted medium-potency topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 3</a>) rather than other treatments. Wet wraps consist of a bottom wet layer and top dry layer; they are applied once or twice daily and can be maintained for two or more hours, as tolerated, and even overnight if patients feel comfortable. Wet wraps can be used until improvement occurs, usually for a few days and to up to 14 days, if tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H1036932978\" class=\"local\">'Wet wraps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For older children (eg, older than six years who can cooperate with treatment) and adolescents who do not respond to or refuse wet wraps, we suggest phototherapy with narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB), if available, rather than systemic immunosuppressive therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Narrowband UVB is usually administered three times per week, with a progressive protocol that increases the dose with each treatment, as tolerated. The patient is usually reassessed after 20 to 25 treatments.
