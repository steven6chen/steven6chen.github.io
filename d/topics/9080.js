Although many features of the history suggest type 2 diabetes and the islet antibody tests were negative, the patient behaves like a patient with type 1 diabetes. She does not have insulin resistance, exhibits lability of blood glucose levels, and requires an intensive insulin regimen with multiple daily injections. The islet antibody tests are approximately 80 percent sensitive and 99 percent specific for type 1 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, negative tests do not exclude the possibility of type 1 diabetes and are consistent with (not diagnostic of) type 2 diabetes. The patient has either type 1 diabetes or the insulin-deficient variant of type 2 diabetes. In the end, it is the patient's clinical phenotype and not the islet cell antibody assay that dictates the appropriate insulin regimen.</p><p>The management of this patient's diabetes was difficult but ultimately rewarding. It took nearly two years to achieve satisfactory control. This case demonstrates that the management of diabetes is an iterative process. In successive interactions with the patient, it was necessary to reduce the total daily insulin dose to prevent hypoglycemia, to teach her to count carbohydrates, and then to convert her from an insulin sliding scale to the use of prandial and correction doses of the rapidly acting insulin.</p><p>When hypoglycemia persisted and hypoglycemia unawareness recurred after these measures had been implemented, it was necessary to search again for undetected hypoglycemia with a continuous glucose monitoring system designed for short-term retrospective analysis (as distinguished from real-time continuous glucose monitoring). These systems measure the glucose values in interstitial fluid continuously at intervals of five or 15 minutes for seven days. The currently available systems measure and record glucose values approximately within a range of 40 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.2 to 22.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. This form of continuous glucose monitoring is indicated in patients who exhibit labile glucose values or unexplained hypoglycemia unawareness after seemingly appropriate adjustments have been made in the insulin regimen and appropriate attention has been paid to diet and physical activity as possible sources of metabolic instability. This tool may be of benefit in adult patients with diabetes to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia and to assist with the management of hypoglycemia unawareness. This diagnostic modality may also be helpful when major changes are made in the diabetes regimen, such as instituting a new insulin regimen or initiating pump therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Self-monitoring of blood glucose in management of adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Continuous glucose monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>This case demonstrates that prolonged nocturnal hypoglycemia, lasting for approximately five hours on one occasion, may not be detected by monitoring the blood glucose level at bedtime and before breakfast. In this patient, the pattern of nocturnal hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia between breakfast and lunch was relatively reproducible from day to day. Even in this patient, the extent of nocturnal hypoglycemia was variable, and might have been missed by fingerstick blood glucose levels at 2 or 3 AM on one of the three days studied.</p><p>This patient's course demonstrates the occurrence of undetected hypoglycemia when glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels are normal or nearly normal and fingerstick blood glucose levels are elevated. In this setting, there must be many low glucose values, which may or may not be detected, to offset the measured high glucose values (assuming that a hemoglobinopathy or recent blood transfusions does not account for the discordance between the hyperglycemia on fingerstick blood glucose values and the A1C level).</p><p>Ultimately, the patient required half as much basal insulin as she had been using and less rapidly acting insulin than she had been taking when she was referred. Effective management required the proper choice of a basal insulin and a reduction in the total daily insulin dose. A truly peakless basal insulin can reduce the occurrence of nocturnal hypoglycemia in some patients. One can only speculate about how this patient came to be on the large doses of insulin she was taking when she was referred. This situation often arises when one treats hyperglycemia with increasing insulin doses in a patient with alternating hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. In a patient with alternating hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, it is usually necessary to reduce or eliminate the hypoglycemia before correcting the hyperglycemia. This is a matter of safety. It is also usually the most practical approach.</p><p>Hypoglycemia unawareness is due to recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which result in an attenuated sympathoadrenal (sympathetic neural and also adrenomedullary) response to hypoglycemia. In this condition, the patient loses the sympathetic neural warning symptoms (palpitations, tremor, anxiety, diaphoresis, hunger) that allow the patient to recognize and respond to hypoglycemia. It is often accompanied by defective glucose counterregulation, a consequence of an absent glucagon response and an attenuated epinephrine response to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia unawareness and defective glucose counterregulation occur in patients with type 1 diabetes and advanced (insulin-deficient) type 2 diabetes. Hypoglycemia unawareness can be reversed by the meticulous avoidance of hypoglycemia for several weeks to months, which improves the epinephrine component of glucose counterregulation.
