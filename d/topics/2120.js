As of late 2016, such testing consists of determining the ABO blood group and Rh blood type of the donated unit, testing for red cell antibodies, and performing infectious disease screening for the following agents: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I, HTLV-II, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, West Nile virus, <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (syphilis), <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> (Chagas disease, only required to be performed on the first donation by a particular donor), and Zika virus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. All infectious disease screening assays must be negative in order to release the blood unit or its components to hospitals for transfusion.</p><p>In addition to these tests, some donated units are tested for <em>Babesia microti </em>and some for cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies, and virtually all apheresis platelet units are tested for bacterial contamination by an automated culturing technique initiated 24 hours after collection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection#H1969743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;, section on 'Detection of contamination'</a>.)

Many additional assays have subsequently been introduced into routine blood screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106595 \">table 2</a>); several of these assays have undergone significant modifications to increase sensitivity and specificity (these revised assays are designated by a change in name, or generation or version number) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Minipool nucleic acid testing (NAT) was added to routine serological screening in 1999.</p><p>Implementation of this large number of new tests resulted in changes at blood donor centers, including the development of sophisticated computer systems to handle the complexity of information and the establishment of quality assurance programs to validate computer function and laboratory performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Testing of donated blood at individual blood centers has been replaced, for the most part, by testing at large centralized laboratories that can better ensure compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and can use expensive high throughput automated equipment, which minimizes the chance for human error.</p><p>Specific testing protocols vary by country and sometimes by region. As an example, donated blood in the United States is not routinely screened for evidence of infection with human parvovirus B19, a respiratory virus that can cause fifth disease in children and red cell aplasia in individuals with chronic hemolytic anemia (eg, sickle cell disease). In contrast, all Japanese Red Cross Blood Centers have screened for parvovirus B19 since 1997 using immunoassays or NAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional testing has been added as needed (eg, for Zika virus). (See <a href=\"#H1769498659\" class=\"local\">'Zika virus'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643789\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoassays for antibodies or pathogen antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infectious disease screening assays for antibodies to pathogenic organisms (which demonstrate host response to an infection) and antigens from these organisms use either the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) or a similar chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLIA) method and follow the same general protocol:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial sample readout is below the cutoff, the sample is classified as negative for that agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the sample readout exceeds that of the cutoff, the result is classified as initially reactive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All initially reactive samples are retested in the same assay system in duplicate, usually on the next working day. If one or both of the duplicate tests are also reactive the sample is classified as repeat reactive and is, by definition, positive. A positive screening test results in the destruction of the unit. If both repeat test results are negative, the initially reactive result is equivalent to a negative result and the unit is released from quarantine and made available for transfusion.</p><p/><p>Such an approach is scientifically sound due to known problems with nonspecific binding, resulting in initially positive <span class=\"nowrap\">EIA/CLIA</span> test results that cannot be duplicated on careful repeat testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nucleic acid testing (NAT)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Minipool testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beginning in 1999, blood banks implemented minipool nucleic acid testing (NAT) technology for detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nucleic acids (RNA) in donated blood. In 2003, West Nile virus (WNV) NAT was added. Since 2009, blood centers have replaced the dual assay for HIV and HCV nucleic acids with a triplex assay that detects hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and HIV and HCV RNA.</p><p>For logistic and cost reasons, NAT in the United States is performed on pools (designated minipool NAT, or MP-NAT) of samples from 6 to 16 blood donors. There are two major methods in use: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transcription mediated amplification (TMA). If a positive result is obtained on a pool of samples, further testing is performed to establish which donation was the source of the positive result, and then further discriminatory testing is performed to determine which of the three viruses (HIV, HCV, or HBV) is present. Newer assay systems are able to distinguish which virus is present without this further discriminatory testing step. In any case, the positive unit is discarded and all the negative units in the pool are used for transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Individual donation testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAT of individual samples (ID-NAT) is more expensive and time-consuming than MP-NAT, but ID-NAT results in higher assay sensitivity. As an example, it has been estimated that the time period between infectivity of a blood sample (estimated as 1 viral copy per 20 mL) and its detection by NAT can be shortened from 9.0 to 5.6 days for HIV and from 7.4 to 4.9 days for HCV by replacing MP-NAT with ID-NAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The resultant shortening of the &quot;window period&quot; (ie, the time between infectivity of a sample and its detection by laboratory testing) by conversion to ID-NAT has been estimated to result in a reduction in the risk of developing HIV or HCV infection from blood transfusion from the current value of 1 per 1 to 2 million units to 1 per 3 to 4 million units. However, taking MP-NAT as a baseline, the marginal cost of introducing ID-NAT has been estimated to exceed USD $12 million per quality-adjusted life-year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This poor cost-effectiveness has resulted in the large majority of blood donor screening laboratories continuing to use MP-NAT for simultaneous detection of HIV, HCV, and HBV.</p><p>The situation with regard to ID-NAT for West Nile virus (WNV) is somewhat different, as it has been demonstrated that a significant proportion of WNV RNA-positive units will be missed by MP-NAT, due to the low viral titers present in WNV infection. For this reason, the major blood programs have adopted a more cost-effective strategy of targeted ID-NAT, implementing this test if and when the WNV epidemic exceeds a defined threshold in a given geographic region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As of 2013, most blood centers implement ID-NAT after the detection of one or two MP-NAT positive donations and then will revert from ID-NAT to MP-NAT when the region has no ID-NAT reactive donations for at least 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>The true benefits of ID-NAT may be limited, since the vast majority of viremic donations missed by MP-NAT are IgG antibody positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Retrospective data suggest that WNV is very rarely, if ever, transmitted in the presence of IgG antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In August 2016, the FDA recommended national Zika virus ID-NAT be implemented with a phase-in period of 4 to 12 weeks. This extremely precautionary measure was taken due to the potentially severe effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy and concerns that donor history questions (previously implemented in March 2016) would be insufficient to completely address the risk of transfusion-transmission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR NOTIFICATION AND ELIGIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because all transfusion-transmitted infectious agents are of low prevalence in the asymptomatic donor population, the predictive value of a positive screening test will be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, since a positive screening result will usually be a false positive result, it is essential that screening tests be followed with a more specific supplementary or confirmatory test (US Food and Drug Administration licensed) prior to notifying donors of their test results. Results of supplemental testing may indicate that the donor is infected, is false positive and is not infected, or may be inconclusive (indeterminate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the case of reactivity by nucleic acid testing (NAT) in the absence of positive serological assays, further NAT testing of an alternate sample source (eg, the plasma component bag) or follow-up sampling of the donor is needed to confirm the test results.</p><p>Blood centers have developed notification and counseling procedures for each type of result for each tested agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Most notifications, other than for HIV-seropositive donors, are done by letter. In addition to receiving the information, the donor is instructed to telephone an appropriate person at the blood center to discuss his or her test results. The basic principles of donor notification for confirmed seropositive donors involve providing information to the donor accurately, confidentially, as quickly as possible, and in a manner that alleviates anxiety and promotes understanding. Seropositive donors need to be informed of their ineligibility as donors, the medical significance of their test result, the need to see a physician (if appropriate), and the possible modes of transmission of the agent. Because notification of indeterminate donors carries uncertainty about their infection status, the counseling process is difficult and often results in donor anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Future donation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions as to the future eligibility of the donor must also be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. HIV and HCV <span class=\"nowrap\">EIA/CLIA-positive</span> donors are ineligible for future donation, regardless of confirmatory test results. They can be requalified as donors if they participate in a formal reevaluation known as re-entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In brief, re-entry involves obtaining negative screening and supplemental test results on a sample collected at least six months subsequent to the initial positive screening results.</p><p>In contrast, donors with repeat reactive anti-HBc (hepatitis B core antibody) results or with positive anti-HTLV EIA results not confirmed by supplemental testing are allowed by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations to continue donating until a second such occurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) Donors who have been deferred for two reactive anti-HBc results can be reinstated (&quot;re-entered&quot;) if the blood center follows the FDA prescribed retesting protocol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIOUS DISEASE SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following provides a description of the transfusion-transmitted infections for which routine blood donor screening occurs in the United States, including transfusion-transmitted viral infections (TTVI), transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections (TTBI), and other transfusion-transmitted infections such as Chagas disease. As indicated in a 2016 publication, a new national system (Transfusion-Transmissible Infection Monitoring Systems) that tabulates data from the largest United States blood collection organizations (accounting for over half of United States blood collections) has been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215879\"><span class=\"h2\">Viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential transfusion-transmitted viral infections for which blood is screened include HIV, HTLV-I and -II, hepatitis B and C viruses, West Nile virus, Zika virus, and for some units, cytomegalovirus (CMV).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV-1 and HIV-2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two HIV-related screening tests are performed on each donated unit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibody testing</strong> &ndash; HIV-1 antibody testing was first implemented in 1985 and has subsequently undergone significant improvements. In 1992, an assay <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIV-1/HIV-2</span> antibody test) with improved sensitivity was implemented; the increased sensitivity was due both to its ability to detect IgM in addition to IgG antibody, and its detection of HIV-2 antibody due to the addition of HIV-2 specific antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Seroconversion to antibody positivity as determined by this testing takes approximately three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of HIV from blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Samples that test positive by the antibody screening assay (either an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EIA] or a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay) are further tested by one of two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed HIV-1 confirmatory methods (Western blot or immunofluorescence assay) and by an anti-HIV-2 supplemental assay. Donors testing positive by HIV-1 confirmatory assays are counseled that they have been infected with HIV-1; however, false positive confirmatory results sometimes occur in the low prevalence setting of blood donor screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The rate of confirmed HIV seropositivity in tested blood donations from first-time and repeat blood donors in a population has been reported as 1 per 35,000 donations; in first-time donors, the prevalence rate is 1 in 10,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nucleic acid testing (NAT)</strong> &ndash; HIV NAT detects HIV-1 RNA, which further reduces the window between infection and a positive test result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In <span class=\"nowrap\">1999/2000,</span> HIV minipool NAT (MP-NAT) was introduced into routine blood donor screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This assay detects HIV RNA, which appears earlier than p24 viral protein or anti-HIV antibody, and has reduced the infectivity window to approximately 9 to 11 days (from approximately 22 days with antibody testing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/7,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,28</a>]. In the first three years of testing of over 30 million blood donations in the United States, approximately 12 HIV viremic, antibody negative donations were identified, for a rate of detection of about 1 in 3 million units. Data from 2008 indicate that this rate was approximately 1 in 2 million units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].In 2011 to 2012, 14 such donations were identified for a rate of 1 in 1.1 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Current estimates for the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection range from 1 in 1.5 million to 1 in 2 million units in the United States and 1 in 7.8 to 10 million units in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/3,28,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28,30-33</a>].

Further, all p24 antigen positive, anti-HIV negative donors were shown to be positive by HIV MP-NAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">HTLV-I and HTLV-II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each unit of blood is screened in a single assay that detects antibodies to either of the closely related retroviruses, human T cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-I and HTLV-II.

Due to immunologic crossreactivity, antibodies to HTLV-II, a closely related retrovirus prevalent in United States blood donors, are often but not always detected by this assay. Consequently, in early 1998, the screening assay was improved by inclusion of HTLV-II antigens. As of 2016, screening test results are confirmed by an FDA-licensed confirmatory assay.</p><p>Previously, blood banks used one of several different algorithms making counseling of HTLV <span class=\"nowrap\">EIA/chemiluminescence</span> enzyme immunoassay-positive donors inconsistent and difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35</a>]. The rate of confirmed HTLV seropositivity in tested blood donations from first-time and repeat blood donors in a population has been reported as 1 per 30,000 donations; in first-time donors, the prevalence rate is 1 in 6000 to 1 in 7500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/22,26,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26,36,37</a>].

A third version of the assay (designated as EIA 3.0) was licensed by the FDA in 1996. EIA 3.0 detects HCV infection slightly sooner than EIA 2.0, resulting in a 70-day infectious window period with EIA 3.0 rather than the 82-day window with EIA 2.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Additionally, EIA 3.0 appears to detect a higher number of persons (approximately 3 percent more) with resolved, nonviremic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>For many years, confirmation testing was performed with the FDA-licensed Recombinant ImmunoBlot Assay (RIBA) 3.0. RIBA 3.0 results can be positive, indeterminate, or negative.

RIBA is no longer commercially available in the United States, and confirmation of infectivity is done either using results of MP-NAT screening or by performing a second manufacturer's enzyme or chemiluminescence-based immunoassay.

HCV MP-NAT has been estimated to reduce the undetectable infectious window period to approximately 8 to 10 days compared with the 70-day window using HCV EIA 3.0 antibody testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/28,30,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,45,46</a>].</p><p>In the first three years of testing of over 39 million blood donations in the United States, approximately 170 HCV viremic antibody negative donations were identified, for a rate of detection of about 1 in 230,000 units, helping to prevent the transmission of approximately 56 HCV infections annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Estimates for the risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV infection range from 1 in 1 million to 1 in 2 million units in the United States, and 1 in 2.3 to 3 million in Canada; a marked decrease from the earlier estimate of 1 in 100,000 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/3,26,30-32,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26,30-32,46</a>].</p><p>Measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was introduced into blood donor screening in 1986 as an indirect (ie, surrogate) test to identify some donors who were carriers of non-A, non-B hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. After the discovery of HCV, it was shown that over 90 percent of cases of transfusion-transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis was attributable to HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In 1995, a National Institutes of Health consensus panel concluded that ALT testing was no longer necessary for blood safety given the fact that anti-HCV testing detects most HCV infectious donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/7,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,48</a>].

Samples testing positive by EIA (or chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay) are confirmed using a neutralization assay provided with the test kit. HBsAg may be positive in acute infection or as a result of a chronic carrier state; blood donor screening does not distinguish these two scenarios. Despite the improved sensitivity of the CLIA assay, the infectious window period prior to development of HBsAg may be as long as 38 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>HBsAg confirmed positive rates in tested blood donations from first-time and repeat blood donors are 1 in 13,000 donations; in first-time donors, the prevalence rate is 1 in 2400 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. False positive neutralization results occasionally occur in the blood donor setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Neutralization positive donors are deferred from future donation.</p><p>Screening for antibody to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) began in 1987 as a surrogate assay for carriers of non-A, non-B hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/47,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51</a>]. In 1990, the anti-HBc assay was licensed by the FDA based upon its ability to decrease the risk of HBV infection by detecting some HBsAg-negative donors who are capable of transmitting HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Anti-HBc develops early in the course of HBV infection and remains positive whether infection is resolved or becomes chronic. Approximately 1 percent of donors test anti-HBc positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]; however, some older FDA-approved assays had poor specificity and there are no confirmatory assays to determine with certainty which donation is potentially infectious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>].

Upon referral to a physician, detection of antibody to HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs) often serves as a second independent assay to establish past HBV infection provided the donor has not received HepB vaccine.</p><p>The estimate for the risk of transfusion-transmitted HBV infection, prior to the introduction of HBV MP-NAT in the United States and Canada, ranges from 1 in 58,000 to 1 in 269,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. NAT assays originally used to detect HIV and HCV have been modified to also include detection of HBV. The practice of testing for HBV nucleic acid as part of MP-NAT screening is routine in the United States, lowering the risk of HBV transmission to 1 in 1 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/29,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,54</a>]. In 2011 to 2012, 14 HBV viremic, HBsAg negative donations were identified for a rate of 1 in 1.1 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">West Nile virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>West Nile virus (WNV) was shown to be transmitted by blood transfusion in the fall of 2002, with 23 cases eventually documented from that year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

For this reason, WNV blood donor screening is performed using only an NAT system; serological screening is not used in conjunction with NAT, as is the case for HIV and HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Also, unlike other transfusion-transmitted viruses, WNV infection is seasonal in its occurrence and has shown significant geographic and temporal variation throughout the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/14,15,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,57</a>].</p><p>In response to documented transfusion risk, as well as the uncertainty of the projected size of the WNV mosquito-borne epidemic in the United States in 2003 and subsequent years, a decision was made to develop a minipool NAT (MP-NAT) program to detect donors with WNV viremia. These tests were implemented nationwide in July 2003, under FDA approval, using minipools of 6 or 16 different donation samples, depending on the manufacturer's format [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Targeted individual donation testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data accumulated in late 2003 indicated that despite MP-NAT screening, a small number of breakthrough transfusion-transmitted cases of WNV occurred, due to donors who were very early in infection and whose viral loads were below the threshold of detection by MP-NAT. Although a small number of breakthrough infections have occurred since MP-NAT testing was implemented (ie, 13 cases reported as of early 2016), most of these occurred prior to the implementation of the targeted individual donation (ID) NAT testing strategy described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/14-16,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,59-61</a>].</p><p>The targeted ID-NAT testing strategy was designed to balance the residual risk of transfusion transmission from units screened with MP-NAT against the limitations in testing capacity due to lack of sufficient automation for performing ID-NAT. It involves real-time tracking of MP-NAT results in defined geographic regions, based on a predetermined initiation trigger, at which point all units would be tested by ID-NAT rather than MP-NAT. Criteria for discontinuing ID-NAT and reverting to MP-NAT also have been refined over time. The initiation trigger for ID-NAT at most blood centers is detection of a single MP-NAT-positive donation, and the criterion for reverting to MP-NAT is the absence of ID-NAT-reactive donations for a defined time frame (usually a minimum of 14 consecutive days, although it may be longer in some programs in WNV epidemic areas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/12,13,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,62</a>].</p><p>All WNV transfusion-transmissions, with one possible exception, have been from viremic donors who were IgG negative, leading to the conclusion that the presence of IgG antibody is protective against transmission via transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similarly, the vast majority of these transmissions occurred from units that were also IgM negative, suggesting that IgM may also be protective. However, in the somewhat different setting of organ transplantation, WNV transmission has been documented in three of four recipients of liver, lung, and kidneys from a common donor who had no detectable WNV plasma viremia but was positive for IgM and IgG antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. This finding may indicate that virus is present in organ reservoirs at a time when it is undetectable in plasma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been estimated that if ID-NAT testing is implemented early in the course of a region-specific epidemic, 5 to 10 percent of the units detected would be MP-NAT-negative, ID-NAT-positive, IgM- and IgG-negative, and therefore potentially infectious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Identification of viremic donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>National testing data from 2003 have shown that approximately 1000 WNV viremic donors were identified in the United States either by MP-NAT or ID-NAT.

Significant geographic and temporal variation occurred in detection of viremic donors, with yields of &gt;5 per 1000 donations in blood centers in some states during the peak two weeks of the 2003 epidemic. The highest frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the largest number of viremic donors were detected in the central upper plains states (ie, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, the Dakotas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/14,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,57</a>]. The average time viremia is detectable by MP-NAT is approximately seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>The overall frequency of WNV RNA-positive donations reported by the American Red Cross during the 2003 epidemic period was 149 per 1 million donations; this decreased to 44 per 1 million donations in the 2004 epidemic period, paralleling the decrease in clinical cases of neuroinvasive WNV disease reported in 2004 to state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was a shift in the geographic location of viremic donors in 2004, with the greatest number of viremic donors detected in Arizona and southern California. In subsequent years, there has been geographic and temporal variation in the number of detected donors, but no positive donors have been identified from mid-December through early April [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Based on a few cases in which low level viremia in the presence of IgM has persisted for several months, the FDA requires that donors found positive by WNV NAT screening be temporarily deferred from donation for 120 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216158\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytomegalovirus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients, such as hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and organ transplant recipients and those infected with HIV. CMV-safe blood is required only for these selected patient populations. In the past, CMV-safe blood needed to be supplied from donors who had no evidence of current or past CMV infection; such donors were identified by testing negative on a CMV antibody assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Unlike the previous screening assays, CMV antibody testing is not performed on each unit of donated blood prior to transfusion, but only on enough units to establish a sufficient inventory of CMV-negative units to supply patient needs. The presence or absence of CMV antibody does not affect a donor's eligibility.</p><p>Because the presence of CMV antibody is a nonspecific assay for CMV infectivity and because 30 to 70 percent of blood donors (depending upon geographic region) test CMV antibody positive, much effort has gone into finding another method of providing CMV-safe blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

In August 2016, the FDA recommended universal testing of blood components for Zika virus in the United States and its territories, allowing for a several month implementation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This recommendation was based on an increasing number of cases of mosquito-borne transmission in Florida, as well as the potential for sexual transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. By late 2016, testing had identified nearly 20 donors in the continental United States with evidence of Zika virus infection, most of whom had traveled to Zika-affected areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. Many of these infections were detected in the late resolving phase (ie, both Zika RNA and anti-Zika antibody were detected), making it unclear if blood components from those donations contained infectious virus that could be transmitted by transfusion. The FDA requires that donors who are found to be reactive by Zika ID-NAT screening be temporarily deferred from donation for 120 days.</p><p>As described separately, blood donor deferral criteria were implemented prior to this testing requirement in order to prevent donations from individuals with possible Zika virus infection.

The intent of this review, published as a supplement to the journal Transfusion, is to provide a set of tools for identifying, describing, and prioritizing those EID agents that have an actual or potential risk of transmission by transfusion and for which there is no currently implemented effective intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>The major part of this supplement consists of individual fact sheets for each agent; these include background information and a detailed review of agent and disease characteristics specifically related to transfusion transmission. Additionally, the authors have prioritized the agents according to the consensus opinion about their anticipated impact on blood safety by considering the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biology and epidemiology of the agent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subjective assessment of public and regulatory concerns about the agent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Availability of sensitive and specific donor screening approaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The agent's geographic range, including potential shifts in the near future</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How frequently prospective donors would be at potential risk of exposure</p><p/><p>Subsequent to the initial AABB publication, revised information about some of these agents and new information about additional EID agents has been added to the <a href=\"http://www.aabb.org/tm/eid/Pages/default.aspx&amp;token=Zhk3SsDNzGEOSDTcBVv9fW9jEE39oN1nvKZ31keC/icFNdSRrWwBCRrsZXwriNMPSN1bNRUQBhsb/p5SkTBbdA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7946\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AABB website section on emerging infectious diseases</a>. As an example of a new agent of concern, several research studies have shown a high prevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA in donors in several European countries (approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 3000), prompting routine donor screening for HEV RNA by nucleic acid testing (NAT) to be implemented in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. However, the prevalence in United States blood donors is far lower (approximately 1 in 10,000), and no screening is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD GROUPING AND TYPING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of blood that is compatible with the recipient's immune system is essential to avoid causing an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction in a recipient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Blood grouping and typing consists of ABO and Rh testing, and antibody screening. The ABO blood group of each unit is determined by using appropriate commercially supplied anti-A and anti-B antibodies to detect the A or B antigen on donor red cells (forward type) and using reagent red cells to detect the reciprocal antibody in the donor's serum (reverse type) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Testing of donor units is conducted with automated high throughput equipment and any discrepancies between forward and reverse type are flagged for further investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For repeat donors, the ABO group of the current donation is verified against historical computer records for accuracy. Upon receipt at the hospital, the ABO group of each unit must be verified by repeat forward group testing.</p><p>Automated methods are used to determine the presence of the Rhesus (Rh) D antigen on donor red cells. D antigen-positive blood transfused to D-negative recipients is highly immunogenic with the formation of anti-D in the majority of recipients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57717 \">table 3</a>); furthermore, anti-D is historically the primary cause of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of non-Rhesus (D) red blood cell alloantibodies during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although red cells have many different antigens in multiple blood group systems, the D antigen is the only non-ABO antigen for which all units of donated blood are routinely screened. There are many antigens of the Rh system other than D that are present on every individual's blood cells; nevertheless, the presence of the D antigen designates a unit as Rh-positive whereas its absence is designated as Rh-negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Blood centers maintain an inventory of special red cell units that have been determined to be negative for common red cell antigens in the Rh and other common blood group systems (Kell, Duffy, Kidd). These antigen-negative units are identified by more extensive red cell phenotyping or genotyping of selected donors. Such units will be made available to patients who have developed antibodies against specific red cell antigens and who therefore require transfusion with red cells lacking those specific antigens (eg, multiply-transfused patients with sickle cell disease, thalassemia, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H13340708\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Minor RBC antigen matching'</a>.)</p><p>Blood donated by donors with a previous history of transfusion or pregnancy must be screened for the presence of red cell antibodies because the transfusion of such antibodies could cause a reaction in patients whose red cells carry that antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In practice, it is easier to screen all donated units for red cell antibodies. The red cell antibody screen is performed using indicator red cells that have the common significant red cell antigen specificities. Components from units with a positive antibody screen will not be transfused, with the possible exception that saline washed red cell units may sometimes be provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
