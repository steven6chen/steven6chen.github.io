With more rapid and effective therapy, alternative definitions such as three units over one hour are more sensitive in identifying patients needing rapid issue of blood products for serious injuries because of uncontrolled hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such transfusion episodes are associated with a number of hemostatic and metabolic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Massive transfusion involves the selection of the appropriate amounts and types of blood components to be administered, and requires consideration of a number of issues including volume status, tissue oxygenation, management of bleeding and coagulation abnormalities, as well as changes in ionized calcium, potassium, and acid-base balance.</p><p>An overview of the Advanced Trauma Life Support approach to massive transfusion with crystalloid fluids and packed red cells is presented here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], as is the &ldquo;damage control&rdquo; approach using red cells and plasma in a 1:1 ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other issues related to the use of blood products are discussed separately.

Other situations leading to massive transfusion, such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurism, liver transplant, and obstetric catastrophes are less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a review of experience in a major trauma center during the year 2000, 8 percent of all admitted patients were given red cells, 3 percent received more than 10 units of red cells during their admission, and 1.7 percent received 10 units in the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More recently, an NIH-sponsored collaboration of trauma centers studying the cytokine response to massive transfusion and other groups reported that the fraction of all patients receiving red cells who go on to receive 10 units of red cells has decreased by 40 percent as more plasma and platelets are given earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Taken together, these data suggest that most injured patients never need massive transfusion and can be treated based on physical assessment and laboratory tests, but approximately 1.7 percent of the most severely injured will require more prompt treatment of coagulopathy, which in turn reduces total blood use in some of them. Appropriate care requires knowing both &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;hemorrhage-control&quot; forms of resuscitation and when to use them. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RED CELL AND VOLUME REPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Correction of the deficit in blood volume with crystalloid volume expanders will generally maintain hemodynamic stability, while transfusion of red cells is used to improve and maintain tissue oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Each unit of packed red blood cells (RBCs) contains approximately 200 mL of red cells and, in an adult, will raise the hematocrit by roughly 3 percentage points unless there is continued bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At rest, oxygen delivery is normally four times oxygen consumption, indicating the presence of an enormous reserve. Thus, if intravascular volume is maintained during bleeding and cardiovascular status is not impaired, oxygen delivery will theoretically be adequate until the hematocrit (packed cell volume) falls below 10 percent. This is because adequate cardiac output plus increased oxygen extraction can compensate for the decrease in arterial oxygen content. However, increasing cardiac work to increase output requires more oxygen, so the &ldquo;critical point&rdquo; where oxygen consumption becomes delivery dependent is higher.</p><p>The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that hemoglobin below 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> be avoided in healthy individuals, and notes that higher values are necessary in those with active cardiovascular disease. In healthy medical student volunteers acutely cytapheresed to hemoglobin concentrations of 5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> equivalent to a hematocrit of 16 percent, correct answers to digit-symbol reversal questions and the strength of retinal-evoked potentials were reduced, but promptly improved with return of their own fresh or stored RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Oxygen release by transfused stored RBCs is diminished compared with normal RBCs. Storage reduces 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) levels, leading to a leftward shift of the lower end of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (2,3-BPG binds to deoxyhemoglobin). This abnormality, however, has not been shown to be clinically important, as the transfused RBCs regenerate 2,3-BPG to normal levels within 6 to 24 hours after transfusion, and most oxygen delivery occurs from the unaffected upper end of the oxygen binding curve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;, section on '2,3 BPG concentration'</a>.)</p><p>The above considerations, however, represent the optimal clinical response to massive RBC loss with adequate volume replacement. An approach to the use of plasma and RBC transfusions in adult patients suffering from shock due to loss of circulating blood volume secondary to hemorrhage is presented below and separately. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Trauma'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERATIONS IN HEMOSTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient being massively transfused may have coagulopathy because of activation and consumption of coagulation factors secondary to tissue trauma, such as massive head injury or muscle damage, or have reduced activity of coagulation factors from prolonged shock, hypoxia, hypothermia, or failure to clear activation peptides that act as competitive inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Such trauma-associated coagulopathy can be diagnosed as acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (acute DIC) when there is microvascular oozing, prolongation of the PT and aPTT in excess of that expected by dilution, together with significant thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen levels, and increased levels of D-dimer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Acute versus chronic DIC'</a>.)</p><p>Even if coagulopathy diagnostic of acute DIC does not exist and coagulation parameters are normal before blood is replaced, coagulation abnormalities may be induced by the dilutional effects of blood replacement on coagulation proteins and the platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. This occurs because packed red cell transfusions are essentially devoid of plasma and platelets, which are removed after collection in the blood component manufacturing process.</p><p>Many patients who suffer massive trauma present to a trauma center with a coagulopathy of trauma that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for acute DIC or dilutional coagulopathy. This coagulopathy is caused by widespread tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/trauma</span> and shock, and their associated physiologic changes (ie, acidosis, hypothermia, consumption of coagulant proteins, and fibrinolysis) combined with extensive blood loss and the dilutional effects of physiologic vascular refill and fluid replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of acidosis and hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both acidosis and hypothermia interfere with the normal functioning of the coagulation system. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acidosis (ie, excess protons) specifically interferes with the assembly of coagulation factor complexes involving calcium and negatively-charged phospholipids. As a result, the activity of the factor <span class=\"nowrap\">Xa/Va</span> prothrombinase complex is reduced by 50, 70, and 80 percent at pHs of 7.2, 7.0, and 6.8, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The resulting delayed production and reduced concentrations of generated thrombin lead to delayed fibrin production, altered fibrin structure, and increased susceptibility to fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The interaction of acidosis with coagulopathy to increased trauma mortality has been widely recognized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma#H83047596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;, section on 'Acidosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothermia reduces the enzymatic activity of plasma coagulation proteins, but has a greater effect by preventing the activation of platelets via traction on the glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">Ib/IX/V</span> complex by von Willebrand factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In tests of shear-dependent platelet activation, this pathway stops functioning in 50 percent of individuals at 30&deg;C and is markedly diminished in most of the rest. This profound effect on platelet-mediated primary hemostasis means that massive bleeding in conjunction with a core temperature of &lt;30&deg;C is rarely survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The onset of this effect is seen at core temperatures of 34&deg;C and below.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulation proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The replacement of blood loss with red cells and a crystalloid volume expander will result in gradual dilution of plasma clotting proteins, leading to prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In an adult, there will be an approximate 10 percent decrease in the concentration of clotting proteins for each 500 mL of blood loss that is replaced. Additional bleeding based solely on dilution can occur when the level of individual coagulation proteins falls to 25 percent of normal. This usually requires 8 to 10 units of red cells in an adult.</p><p>Thus, the PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen or a viscoelastic test of coagulation (also called point of care testing) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55087 \">table 1</a>) should be monitored in patients receiving massive blood transfusions of this magnitude.

Each unit of FFP might be expected to increase the clotting protein levels by 10 percent in an adult, but because of losses in product preparation, storage, and of transfused factors to the interstitial space, typical increments are of the order of 2.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cryoprecipitate or, when available, virus-inactivated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinogen-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fibrinogen concentrate</a>, may be used when fibrinogen levels are critically low (ie, &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In an adult, each 10 to 12 units of transfused RBCs are associated with a 50 percent fall in the platelet count; thus, significant thrombocytopenia can be seen after 10 to 20 units of blood, with platelet counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span>. For replacement therapy in this setting, six units of whole blood derived platelets or one apheresis concentrate should be given to an adult; each unit should increase the platelet count by <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> for a full six unit adult dose.

Replacement therapy should be based on these parameters rather than on any formula (eg, one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for every four units of red cells), except in patients with severe trauma and possibly obstetric hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H1029480\" class=\"local\">'Obstetric hemorrhage'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15779146\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT POPULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While replacement therapy with plasma, platelets, and red blood cells should not generally be based upon any set formula, results from a number of observational studies suggest that patients with severe trauma, massive blood replacement, and coagulopathy have improved survival when the ratio of transfused Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP, in units) to platelets (in units) to red blood cells (RBCs, in units) approaches 1:1:1 (ie, the &ldquo;damage control&rdquo; approach) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H106617583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Massive blood loss'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The physiology supporting the 1:1:1 (FFP:platelets:RBCs) approach derives from the existence of the acute coagulopathy of trauma and the dilute nature of conventional blood products. Patients who present with uncontrolled hemorrhage and shock have typically lost 30 to 40 percent of their blood volume. Conventional resuscitation with crystalloid will rapidly lead to greater than 50 percent dilution of coagulation factors and a diminution of thrombin generation. Resuscitation with FFP, platelets, and RBCs at 1:1:1 unit ratios means that the actual blood being given has a coagulation factor concentration of 65 percent of normal, a platelet count of 88 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> and a hematocrit of 29 percent. Because 30 percent of the platelets and 10 percent of the RBC administered will not circulate, the effective concentrations are a plasma coagulation factor concentration of 65 percent, platelet count of 55 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> and a hematocrit of 26 percent. Thus, giving blood products, and nothing but blood products, barely keeps levels above conventional transfusion triggers. More of any one product merely dilutes the other two, such that giving two units of RBC for every unit of plasma and platelets (1:1:2) leads to a plasma coagulation factor concentration of 52 percent, platelet count of 55 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> and hematocrit of 40 percent; and, after storage related losses, a plasma coagulation factor concentration of 52 percent, platelet count of 37 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> and hematocrit of 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Any crystalloid solution administered will further dilute all three blood components.</p><p>Clinical studies that have shown a benefit for the 1:1:1 approach in massively injured and rapidly bleeding patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial that randomly assigned 680 patients with major bleeding from severe trauma to receive transfusion of 1 versus 2 units of RBC for every unit of FFP and platelets (ie, FFP to platelets to RBC of 1:1:1 versus 1:1:2) found slightly better outcomes with the 1:1:1 approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients assigned to 1:1:1 were more likely to have adequate hemostasis (86 versus 78 percent) and had fewer exsanguination deaths at 24 hours (9 versus 15 percent). Overall mortality at 1 and 30 days were not different between the groups, although there was a trend favoring 1:1:1 at both time points. Adverse events were also similar between the groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 246 patients who presented to an Army combat support hospital in Iraq has produced some data to evaluate the merits of this regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. When patients who received massive transfusion were stratified by transfusion therapy regimen, patients who received a high ratio of FFP to RBCs (median of 1:1.4) had a survival rate of 81 percent, compared with 66 percent for those with an intermediate ratio (median 1:2.5) and 35 percent for those who received a low ratio of FFP to RBCs (median of 1:8).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 467 massively transfused trauma patients, 30-day survival was increased in patients transfused at a high FFP:RBC ratio (ie, &ge;1:2) as well as in those transfused at a high platelet:RBC ratio (ie, &ge;1:2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The combination of high FFP and high platelet to RBC ratios was associated with decreased truncal hemorrhage and increased six-hour, 24-hour, and 30-day survivals, with no change in deaths due to multiple organ failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 694 massively transfused trauma patients who did not receive fresh whole blood, those receiving a high ratio of apheresis platelets (equivalent to six units of pooled platelets) per stored RBC unit (ie, ratio &ge;1:8) had a higher 24-hour survival (95 percent) compared with those receiving a medium (ie, ratio 1:16 to 1:8, 87 percent) or a low ratio (ie, &lt;1:16, 64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. On multivariate analysis, higher FFP:RBC ratios and higher apheresis platelets:RBC ratios were both independently associated with improved survival at both 24 hours and 30 days.</p><p/><p>Such observations have led these and other authors to recommend that patients who have sustained severe traumatic injuries <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who are likely to require massive transfusion receive a 1:1:1 ratio of FFP to platelets to RBCs at the <strong>outset</strong> of their resuscitation and transfusion therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>].

Acidosis does not develop in a massively bleeding patient even if &quot;acidic&quot; blood is infused as long as tissue perfusion is restored and maintained. In this setting, the metabolism of each mmol of citrate generates 3 mEq of bicarbonate (for a total of 23 meq of bicarbonate in each unit of blood). As a result, metabolic alkalosis can occur if the renal ischemia or underlying renal disease prevents the excess bicarbonate from being excreted in the urine. This may be accompanied by hypokalemia as potassium moves into cells in exchange for hydrogen ions that move out of the cells to minimize the degree of extracellular alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

The maximum citrate infusion rate should be 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> per minute (since this represents the maximum rate of citrate metabolism) and the citrate concentration in whole blood is 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (0.015 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mL)</span>. Thus:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Maximum citrate infusion rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(mmol/kg</span> per min)<br/>= &#160; (mmol citrate per mL of blood &#160; x &#160; mL of blood infused per min) &#160; &divide; &#160; wt (kg)</p></div></div><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">mL of blood infused per min &#160; = &#160; (0.02 &#160;&divide; &#160;0.015) &#160;x &#160;wt (kg) &#160; = &#160; 1.33 &#160;x &#160;wt (kg)</p></div></div><p/><p>For a 50 kg recipient with normal hepatic function and perfusion, the maximum rate of blood transfusion to avoid citrate toxicity is 66.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> which is equal to 8.9 units of whole blood per hour (450 mL per unit) and 26.7 units of red cells per hour (approximately 150 mL per unit). Thus, significant hypocalcemia should not develop in this setting except under extreme circumstances. However, the risk is substantially greater in a patient with either preexisting liver disease or ischemia-induced hepatic dysfunction. In such patients, the plasma ionized calcium concentration should be monitored and calcium replaced with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> if ionized hypocalcemia develops:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> is used, 10 to 20 mL should be given intravenously (into another vein) for each 500 mL of blood infused.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> is used, only 2 to 5 mL per 500 mL of blood should be given.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcium chloride</a> may be preferable to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> in the presence of abnormal liver function, since citrate metabolism is decreased, resulting in slower release of ionized calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Care must be taken to avoid administering too much calcium and inducing hypercalcemia, ideally by monitoring the ionized calcium concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF HYPOTHERMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high capacity commercial blood warmer should be used to warm blood components toward body temperature when more than three units are transfused.</p><p>Rapid transfusion of multiple units of chilled blood may reduce the core temperature abruptly and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Six units of RBCs at 4&deg;C will reduce the body temperature of a 70 kg adult by 1&deg;C. This heat loss can be additive with the evaporative heat loss associated with an open abdomen or other body cavity which, by itself, can lead to a 1&deg;C decrease in core temperature in 40 minutes. Thus, 10 units of cold blood products and an hour of surgery can lead to a 3&deg;C drop in core temperature and hypothermic coagulopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF HYPERKALEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and patients with renal impairment may develop hyperkalemia because of potassium leakage due to prolonged blood storage or irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/massive-blood-transfusion/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Irradiation can increase this rate to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span>. Nevertheless, because the volume of suspending solution in a unit of red cells in additive solution is small (150 mL), the actual amount of free K<sup>+</sup> infused with a unit of RBC is only approximately 7 mEq, and this is rapidly pumped back into the cells as they warm. As a result, potassium is only a problem when long-stored red cells are infused directly into the central circulation at high concentrations, as occurs with blood-primed cardiopulmonary bypass machines, high volume transfusion devices, or infants transfused through umbilical catheters.</p><p>In these patients, the following steps can be used to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Select only red cells collected less than 10 days prior to transfusion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any unit of red cells can be washed immediately before infusion to remove extracellular potassium.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of the patient who is being massively transfused requires careful and ongoing consideration of a number of complex physiological relationships. There is no clear threshold for hematocrit, platelet count, or coagulation factor deficiency below which blood use is futile. The primary concern is correction of ischemia, which can be accomplished at the outset by aggressive volume expansion to maintain perfusion pressure as blood is being readied for infusion. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Red cell and volume replacement'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As volume is replaced, attention must be paid to coagulation parameters, platelet count, and metabolic status.

If the PT and aPTT exceed 1.5 times the control value, the patient should be transfused with at least two units of fresh frozen plasma. If the platelet count falls below <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL,</span> six units of random donor platelets, or one unit of apheresis platelets, should be given.

Transfusions are given based upon the patient's injuries and response to the initial transfusions, with attention being paid to any underlying cardiopulmonary disease. In some cases where there is insufficient time to obtain laboratory values to guide transfusion, it may be necessary to use the &ldquo;damage control&rdquo; approach of transfusing red blood cells, platelets, and plasma in a set ratio. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the subset of patients who present with widespread tissue trauma (as in combat injuries) and who present with coagulopathy or the high likelihood of coagulopathy, an approach using plasma as the primary resuscitation fluid has been advocated by the United States military.
