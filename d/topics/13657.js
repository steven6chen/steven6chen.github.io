It was first reported by Hippocrates in 400 BC and has been subsequently reported by investigators on every inhabited continent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic will provide an overview of pica, focusing on its management in pregnant women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15004351\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We define pica as the craving and purposive consumption of substances not culturally defined as food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are three main types: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Geophagy (or sometimes geophagia), the consumption of earth, including soil or other earth-rich items such as adobe, clay preparations, pottery, or bean stones (clumps of earth amongst dried beans)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amylophagy (or amylophagia), the consumption of raw starches, including corn starch, laundry starch, raw rice, and flour</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pagophagy (or pagophagia), the consumption of large quantities of ice or freezer frost </p><p/><p>Ice, starch, and earth are the most commonly consumed substances. Other common pica substances include chalk, charcoal, ash, paper, toilet paper, coffee grounds, baby powder, and paint chips. </p><p>The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) presents a more narrow definition: the behavior should persist for at least one month and any &quot;nutritive&quot; item is not considered pica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, given the ubiquity of both pagophagy and amylophagy and that raw starches are generally not considered foods, we include them in our definition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15004357\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of pica varies by region, culture, and biological and disease status of the population. Pregnant women are by far the most likely group to engage in pica, followed by school-aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pica is most common in residents of warm, moist climates (ie, tropical or temperate regions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Geophagy and amylophagy are common during pregnancy in many regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern United States, and the Indian subcontinent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Growing evidence suggests that pica is also common among Latino populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Medical disorders associated with pica include iron deficiency, zinc deficiency, anemia (of many etiologies), celiac disease, and renal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. </p><p>The exact prevalence of pica worldwide is unclear for many reasons. It varies across countries and ethnic groups, by health status, and with diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. In addition, pica is often underreported by clinicians because they do not ask patients about this behavior and by patients who feel shame or fear of chastisement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In studies among pregnant women in the United States, reported prevalence has been as high as 76.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and as low as 8.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], with most studies reporting prevalences in the 30 to 40 percent range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A meta-analysis reported mean prevalences during pregnancy higher in Africa (44.8 percent) than in either <span class=\"nowrap\">North/South</span> America (23 percent) or Eurasia (17.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15004363\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of pica is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are several physiological hypotheses. One hypothesis is that it is a functional attempt to increase levels of deficient micronutrients. A second hypothesis is that non-food cravings are a non-functional epiphenomenon or side effect of a micronutrient deficiency. Iron and, to a lesser extent zinc, are most often posited as being associated with pica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, there is no convincing evidence of a causal relationship between pica cravings and micronutrient deficiencies. A third hypothesis is that pica is a protective behavior that helps to shield the individual from harmful pathogens or chemicals during times of increased vulnerability, such as pregnancy. While some pica substances are clearly adsorptive and thus may be protective, others, such as ice, are inconsistent with this hypothesis. Further, in many cultures, satisfying a pregnant woman&rsquo;s cravings is seen as important for her well-being and that of the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H39685191\" class=\"local\">'Refractory patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18794108\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pica is based on an individual's report of craving and intentional consumption of substances not culturally defined as food. (See <a href=\"#H15004351\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39683063\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most pica is associated with a physiological condition, typically pregnancy, potential medical disorders associated with pica, such as iron deficiency, anemia, or gastrointestinal malaise (nausea, vomiting, ptyalism, diarrhea), should be excluded by appropriate laboratory studies, history, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>A small fraction of reported pica cases have been associated with a psychiatric disorder, including schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Pagophagy has been reported to be associated with autism spectrum disorder, dementia, and psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It may be associated with thirst and dehydration or used as an analgesic for oral pain, including glossitis or xerostomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Pica involving <span class=\"nowrap\">smelling/sniffing</span> gasoline could represent substance abuse rather than pica.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18793929\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39682967\"><span class=\"h2\">Who to screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest screening all pregnant women for pica at their first prenatal visit as part of a standard dietary history. This can identify women engaged in a potentially harmful practice and also conveys that pica is common in pregnancy and treatable, which may make it easier for the patient to mention it to a healthcare provider if pica develops later in pregnancy. We also suggest rescreening each trimester, especially during the late second or early third trimesters when iron deficiency anemia is often diagnosed. As discussed above, pica is more common in some populations (sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern United States, Indian subcontinent, Hispanic). (See <a href=\"#H15004357\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Screening for pica is also appropriate at any time for women with anemia, iron deficiency, or symptoms that may occur from consumption of substances not culturally defined as food, especially if other causes of these symptoms have been ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15004369\" class=\"local\">'Consequences'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18794059\"><span class=\"h2\">How to screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are often reluctant to admit to pica for a wide range of reasons, including embarrassment, fear of repercussions from family or healthcare providers, and fear of harming herself or her fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. We have had women deny eating earth even though a smudge of clay was evident on their lips and tongue.</p><p>We have had good success by asking, &quot;Do you crave anything that isn't food, like dirt, clay, paint, or lots of ice?&quot; This approach may be more likely to achieve a truthful answer than asking if she has ever eaten such things. If pica is strongly suspected, asking &quot;How much earth, clay, paint, ice, etc have you eaten?&quot; may be useful as it makes the initial admission of pica unnecessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18794130\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISHING THE SCOPE OF THE BEHAVIOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient admits to a craving, she may feel a great deal of relief and provide a great deal of information about her behavior. We suggest obtaining the following information to better understand the behavior, determine if pica may lead to an adverse outcome, and to guide the choice of interventions for reducing the behavior:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Description of pica substance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of craving. Women often report that the craving is motivated by taste, smell, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> texture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of pica.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent findings. Is it associated with signs and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia? If she is craving the taste of something, has her perception changed? Impaired taste or smell may be associated with zinc deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency of cravings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strength of cravings. Can the craving be resisted? This may help distinguish between food cravings due to pregnancy versus those due to pica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. With pica, the craving is often specific and so strong that it cannot be avoided. For example, the woman will not say &quot;I want sweets&quot; or &quot;I feel like having pickles and ice cream.&quot; Instead, she will say &quot;I want XXX brand of chalkboard chalk&quot; or &quot;I have to drive out of my way to go to XXX restaurant to get the crushed ice because I like how it crunches.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency of actual consumption and the amount consumed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If she is craving something but not consuming it, why not? Is she avoiding it or substituting something else for it? &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Source and availability of the substance. Women may import their favorite soil from &quot;home&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Kaolin and other types of clay can also be ordered from online venders. If her desired substance is unavailable, what is she substituting for it? For example, women from Mexico commonly use blocks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium carbonate</a> (&quot;magnesia de terr&oacute;n&quot;) as a substitute for earth because it is thought to be safer, although concerns have been raised about potential magnesium toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the family know? Are they concerned? Women have requested their family members bring them soil from a particular spot but tell the family it is for plants rather than for consumption. Family members may note that there are holes in the house wall, even if the patient won&rsquo;t admit to them that she is eating the adobe block or the plaster. Sometimes family members plead with women to stop non-food consumption to no avail.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggers. What incites the craving? A woman may report her mouth waters when she sees or thinks about eating the substance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional substances? It is important to ask about other cravings. The woman may test the clinician's reaction to admission of craving one substance before admitting to additional cravings. Those additional cravings may be the ones that are more concerning to her.</p><p/><p>A dietitian can be helpful in obtaining this information. Patients disclosing their pica behavior should be treated with respect, and pica should be treated as a normal, common occurrence during pregnancy. Reacting with alarm will more likely reinforce the temptation to keep pica hidden.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15004369\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical findings in women with pica depend on the type and quantity of substances being consumed and whether toxins have contaminated these substances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100150 \">table 1</a>). While multiple case studies have reported serious adverse outcomes associated with pica, many people who engage in pica for a short time do not experience any adverse effects.</p><p>Adverse outcomes are usually related to repeated ingestion over time; however, a few craved items may be immediately toxic. For example, ingestion of coffee grounds can cause caffeine toxicity and ingestion of cigarette filters can cause acute nicotine toxicity. Ingestion of regular bleach typically causes nausea and vomiting before it causing more serious harm, but ultra bleach may cause internal burning. Sniffing highly concentrated chemicals in solvents or aerosols can be lethal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39683132\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pica is often associated with anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. In one meta-analysis that evaluated the association between pica behavior and anemia or low <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit,</span> pica behavior was associated with a twofold increased risk of anemia in pregnant women (odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.68-2.19; 23 studies) compared with no pica behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In another meta-analysis, hemoglobin levels were 0.55 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> lower among women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100150 \">table 1</a>) reporting pica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similar relationships have been observed in non-pregnant populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/3,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39683277\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal gestational weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient's non-food consumption (eg, earth, ice) significantly displaces consumption of caloric items, she may have low gestational weight gain. On the other hand, the consumption of large quantities of items high in calories, such as cornstarch and laundry starch (amylophagy), has been associated with both excessive weight gain and poor blood glucose control (in women with diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One box of cornstarch contains 1590 kcals, and some women report eating up to two boxes per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39683548\"><span class=\"h2\">Micronutrient and trace mineral deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Micronutrient deficiencies can develop if the patient's non-food consumption significantly reduces consumption of nutritive items or the item prevents absorption of micronutrients. For example, clay can induce satiety due to substantial swelling of the clay when exposed to gastric fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Clay can also prevent absorption of micronutrients by binding with micronutrients in consumed food or forming a matrix with the mucin layer of the gut, thereby creating a barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In vitro data suggest that iron can be bound by clays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], but there are no data on this possibility with other micronutrients. In the meta-analysis described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], pica behavior in mixed populations was associated with lower plasma zinc levels compared with no pica behavior, but the difference was not significant after exclusion of outliers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24435510\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced effectiveness of medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concomitant administration of clays, starch, charcoal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnesium trisilicate (a common antacid) together with pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], cardiac medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and antimalarials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] can bind these pharmaceuticals, rendering them less effective. A study comparing the capacity of activated charcoal, kaolin, magnesium trisilicate, and raw starch to manage <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> poisoning reported that all bound significant quantities of the antibiotic in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39684341\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrolyte abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clay can bind potassium in the intestine, leading to clinical sequelae of electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemic myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Ingestion of large amounts of baking powder (potassium bitartrate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, and starch)&nbsp;or baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) can result in metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, or hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Zinc deficiency is a common problem in developing countries; however, in the US and other developed countries, even vegetarians who consume less zinc (no animal tissue) and more inhibitors (phytates) do not consistently have lower zinc status than omnivores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. We do not routinely check zinc levels, given the low prevalence of zinc deficiency in the US and uncertainty about laboratory assessment of zinc status, especially during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15004411\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to treatment of women with pica is based on data from case studies and our extensive clinical experience in this area. There are no evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of pica. In the only randomized placebo-controlled trial, iron supplementation of children with geophagy did not reduce the prevalence of the behavior nor the amount of earth eaten by the children, although this trial was limited by poor compliance and high drop-out rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>The key components of treatment are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understanding and reassurance, which will help to maintain communication, build trust, and gain the woman's willingness to accept and adhere to a treatment plan</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying the substance(s) consumed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiating a harm reduction strategy: treating the underlying cause of the craving, decreasing exposure to the item craved, or substituting a healthier alternative that will satisfy the craving </p><p/><p>Simply telling the woman to not eat the craved item won't work and will likely result in hiding continued consumption. Referral to a dietitian can be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39684822\"><span class=\"h2\">Understanding and reassurance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We have found that a key step in helping patients with their cravings is showing understanding and reassurance. Speaking the woman's native language, taking the time to ask questions and listen to answers, and reinforcing the concept that pica is very common (ie, she is not alone in her cravings) will help to maintain communication and build trust. Asking patients about their experiences often helps to get very good buy-in and adherence with clinical advice, and guides modifications in treatment. Find out about what she tried, when her symptoms changed, if cravings stopped before or after she began to feel better, or about the substitutes that worked best. Anecdotally, women report a reduction in cravings shortly after they began to feel less tired and out of breath.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39685204\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying the substance(s) consumed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After gaining the woman's trust, identifying the nature of the substance(s) she is consuming is critical to determine the potential adverse consequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100150 \">table 1</a>) and treatment approach. Consumption of highly toxic substances must be stopped immediately. In the United States, Poison Control (1-800-222-1222) is an excellent resource for assessing immediate danger. In these cases, informing the woman that she is at high risk of seriously harming herself and her baby and offering a substitution may stop the behavior. Asking about pica early in pregnancy may prompt the woman to disclose cravings later in pregnancy that are potentially harmful, and before ingestion. </p><p>A less rigorous approach, as described below, can be taken for other cravings (see <a href=\"#H39685227\" class=\"local\">'Initiating a harm reduction strategy'</a> below). A few substances, such as ice, are usually not harmful, although jaw pain and chipped teeth have been reported. The risks associated with other substances are unclear as multiple factors affect maternal risk (eg, specific substance, quantity consumed), the substance may contain many unidentifiable contaminants, and information on fetal risk from these types of exposures is limited or nonexistent. For example, the safety of earth is highly variable. While some clays are used in pharmaceutical preparations (Kaopectate took its name from the clay kaolin, and smectite is used in a number of antidiarrheal preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]), it is difficult to assess the safety of earth from unknown sources or to assess the actual amount and type of clay being consumed. Home sterilization of soil is not recommended because it may not kill all pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and would not remove harmful heavy metal contaminants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39685227\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiating a harm reduction strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Harm reduction strategies include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substitution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of the underlying cause, when possible</p><p/><p>We offer substitutions as the first-line approach for most women, unless the woman seems willing to decrease or avoid the exposure. We assume that women are unlikely to decrease exposure if they are not clearly concerned about the safety of pica or if they express no interest in or perceived ability to decrease or eliminate the practice. Concurrently, we try to treat the underlying cause, which may be iron <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> zinc deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39685258\"><span class=\"h3\">Substitution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is often possible to find an acceptable alternative to the craved item that satisfies the organoleptic property (ie, taste, texture, or smell) that was initially alluring. For example, for women who crave wet dirt, we suggest they smell the wet dirt as they eat a burned tortilla, toast, jicama, dry oatmeal or any other substance that she thinks might be comparable. Chewing ice can also be a good substitute for dirt. For women who crave the crunch of cement, ice and Mexican hot chocolate disks have been successful substitutes. For those craving the sour taste of baking powder, sour hard candies have worked. Chewing gum substitutes well for the rubber from tires, unless the woman is craving the smell of the rubber.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39685269\"><span class=\"h3\">Decreased exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the substance craved cannot be eliminated, decreasing exposure can be useful. For example, women who crave the smell of gasoline are asked to stand as far from the source as possible to minimize the inhalation of toxic substances. For relatively non-toxic items (eg, cornstarch, bath soap, handwashing dish soap, chalkboard chalk, napkins or toilet paper), some women will be willing to reduce the quantities consumed after appropriate counseling. This counseling might include warning them that, while we do no't have strong evidence of harm, we also do not know all of the components of the item and the effect these components might have on a developing fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39685278\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of the underlying cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although clinicians may favor treating the underlying cause of pica as the preferred approach, the cause is usually cultural or not known and data on treatment are both scant and inconsistent. As previously mentioned, there are no evidence-based treatment guidelines. We take the following approach.</p><p>If pica occurs early in pregnancy and is associated with nausea and vomiting or ptyalism (excessive secretion of saliva), we recommend interventions to relieve nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, and these measures may also mitigate pica. Many women attribute their pica cravings to attempts to relieve nausea and ptyalism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-outcome-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and outcome of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although iron deficiency is common in women with pica, whether iron deficiency causes pica or whether treatment of iron deficiency leads to improvement in pica is unclear. Treatment of iron deficiency is reasonable medically and usually successful. Iron infusions have been effective in reducing pica cravings when administered to women with iron deficiency (ie, low iron stores, but without apparent anemia; hematocrit and hemoglobin still in the normal range) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>In our clinical experience, we have found that recommending consumption of foods high in heme iron (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100190 \">table 3</a>) can lower pica cravings. Food is often more acceptable to patients than pharmacologic supplements, contains multiple nutrients, and may be more effective. Although no intervention studies have evaluated the effectiveness of iron or zinc supplements versus food sources of these minerals, it is known that heme iron (found only in meats) is better absorbed than the non-heme iron (found in meat, non-meat sources, and supplements). Women are encouraged to consume food sources of iron several times per week. In general, red meats (beef, goat) contain more heme iron than white meats (chicken, pork), and some wild meats (deer, elk, buffalo, bear, etc) contain higher iron levels than beef. Some, but not all, organ meats are excellent sources of iron, including liver, kidneys, heart, and gizzards (liver intake should be limited because high levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> are teratogenic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy#H1103979071\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Consumption of liver-based foods'</a>.)</p><p>Oysters, mussels, and octopus are some of the more common seafoods highest in iron. Because the etiology of pica may also include zinc deficiency, eating these meats, many of which are high in zinc, may also be beneficial. We therefore recommend discussing this table of foods with any women experiencing pica and certainly with those demonstrating these micronutrient deficiencies, to determine which are acceptable and available. While the pica may not be completely resolved, improvement often occurs in a few weeks and women report feeling less tired and out of breath.</p><p>While various psychotropic medications, especially selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been used for treatment of pica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/41,52,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,52,65</a>], we would only use these drugs in the limited situations where psychiatric comorbidity is present. We do not refer women with pica for psychiatric consultation since the basis for pica in our practice is cultural. We would refer patients if we suspected a psychiatric disorder.</p><p>Although a large number of case reports attribute the resolution of pica to an increase in iron, zinc, or hemoglobin levels, blinded studies of the effects of iron supplementation on pica behavior have been inconclusive. The following examples reflect this body of information: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized double-blind trial of the effect of iron supplementation in women with non-ice pica reported iron supplementation did not reduce pica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. One controlled observational study also reported no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], whereas other observational studies of the administration of intramuscular iron injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous fumarate</a> syrup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>] reported a benefit when compared with control injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], syrups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], or subjects' own behavior prior to supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two studies of the effects of iron supplementation in women with ice pica (pagophagy) offer some support of the hypothesis that iron deficiency causes pica. In one single-blinded study in which participants were their own controls, the quantity of ice participants consumed diminished rapidly after the administration of iron but did not disappear completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The strongest evidence in support of iron deficiency causing pica comes from a study in which anemic rats consumed a greater proportion of their daily water in the form of ice than nonanemic controls (96 versus 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Recovery from anemia eliminated this behavior. Lastly, others have observed that pagophagy disappeared immediately when anemic patients were given intravenous iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Why iron deficiency is associated with pagophagy is unknown. However, there is evidence that chewing ice improves alertness and the response time on a neuropsychological test for people who are anemia but not for others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Various mechanisms have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No controlled studies have examined the effects of zinc supplementation alone on human pica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One observational study among pregnant women in Argentina noted that women with pica reported diets significantly lower in zinc, heme iron, animal protein, and total meat intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, total iron intakes were similar in both groups and there was no difference in the use of vitamin-mineral supplements between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15004417\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pica related to strong cultural beliefs is unlikely to stop completely.</p><p>During follow-up, we determine whether the woman is still craving non-food substances. If she is craving a substance, is the craving stronger or weaker than at her last visit? Is she eating the substance or resisting the cravings? Have other cravings appeared? Are they dangerous? Are her iron indicators worse?</p><p>If her cravings have subsided, we reassure her that she is on the right track. We have observed that she may not realize that things have changed. Family members of one woman noticed that she had stopped eating the ice out of all of their glasses before she noticed an improvement.</p><p>If her cravings have not improved or have worsened, we reassure her again that she is normal and assess her adherence to previous recommendations. If she hasn&rsquo;t eaten heme-rich foods, we reinforce the importance of resolving iron deficiency anemia for a healthy pregnancy and delivery. If she hasn&rsquo;t tried substitutions, we try to find out why and encourage her to try this approach. We also try to determine whether there are familial or cultural issues that are competing with medical advice. There have even been reports of verbal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical abuse from family members when their advice to consume non-foods is not followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"#H39685191\" class=\"local\">'Refractory patients'</a> below).

It allows the woman to comply with the craving but using something that is potentially less dangerous. </p><p>There are many reasons women may not want to stop their non-food consumptions. Some women view pica as neither harmful nor helpful, simply a normal sign of being pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], a way of making the baby happy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], or satisfying the fetus' craving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pica-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The scope of behavior (eg, substance craved, amount consumed, triggers) should be ascertained in women who screen positive. (See <a href=\"#H18793929\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18794130\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the scope of the behavior'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical findings in women with pica depend on the type and quantity of substances being consumed and whether toxins have contaminated these substances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100150 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15004369\" class=\"local\">'Consequences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing is guided by the patient's pica cravings and associated symptoms. Pica is strongly associated with iron deficiency and anemia, so <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit</span> levels should be checked. (See <a href=\"#H39685296\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The key components of treatment are (see <a href=\"#H15004411\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Understanding and reassurance, which will help to maintain communication, build trust, and gain the woman's willingness to accept and adhere to a treatment plan</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Identifying the substance(s) consumed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initiating a harm reduction strategy: substituting a healthier alternative that will satisfy the craving, decreasing exposure to the item craved, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treating the underlying cause of the craving. Substitution is the most successful approach.
