Research suggests that as many as 50 percent of all cases have their onset in childhood and adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Treatments for OCD in children and adolescents include medications and psychotherapy. A combination of medication and psychotherapy may be useful in cases of more-severe, comorbid or treatment refractory illness.</p><p>This topic reviews the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis of OCD in children and adolescents are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of OCD in adults are also discussed separately. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococci (PANDAS) is also discussed separately.

For mild to moderate cases of pediatric OCD, we suggest first-line treatment with CBT. An SRI can be used first-line in cases of patient and family preference or if CBT were not available. (See <a href=\"#H5729873\" class=\"local\">'Comparing medication and CBT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19049181\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>For more severe presentations of pediatric OCD, we suggest first-line treatment with a combination of an SRI and CBT. The SRI may be needed to decrease the OCD and associated anxiety symptoms to a level where CBT can be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In our clinical experience, concomitant use of CBT may allow for the use of a lower dose of an SRI than would otherwise be needed, potentially reducing medication side effects.

Complex tics can be misdiagnosed as OCD.

All antidepressants used in the United States have a boxed warning by the US Food and Drug Administration about suicidality. There appears to be a slightly increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (but not completed suicide) among a small group of children and adolescents who are treated with antidepressant medications compared with placebo; however, the evidence is inadequate to conclusively establish this association, which is described in more detail separately.

Improvement of OCD symptoms may occur more slowly with fluoxetine than with other SSRIs, eg, more than eight weeks on a therapeutic dose to manifest significant benefit.</p><p>Children and adolescents who are treated with antidepressants should be closely monitored by the clinician and family for suicidal <span class=\"nowrap\">thoughts/behaviors</span> and symptoms of mania.
