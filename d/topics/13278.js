By convention, PID is initiated by a sexually transmitted agent, which ascends into the upper genital tract, distinguishing it from pelvic infections caused by trans-cervical medical procedures, pregnancy, and other primary abdominal processes that can extend to pelvic organs.</p><p>Overall, the prevalence of PID in the United States and many other resource-rich countries has decreased in the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the United States, PID accounts for approximately 106,000 outpatient visits and 60,000 hospitalizations each year, and is a frequent cause for emergency department visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Each woman with PID costs around $2000 USD to treat, rising to $6000 if she develops chronic pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The pathogenesis and microbiology of PID as well as risk factors for PID will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and sequelae of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaginal flora of most normal, healthy women includes a variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among these are species of streptococci, staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae (most commonly <em>Klebsiella</em> spp, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Proteus</em> spp), and a variety of anaerobes. Compared with the dominant, non-pathogenic, hydrogen peroxide-producing <em>Lactobacillus</em> species, these other organisms are present in low numbers, and ebb and flow under the influence of hormonal changes (eg, pregnancy, menstrual cycle), contraceptive method, sexual activity, and other as yet unknown forces.</p><p>The endocervical canal functions as a barrier protecting the normally sterile upper genital tract from the organisms of the dynamic vaginal ecosystem. Endocervical infection with sexually transmitted pathogens can disrupt this barrier. Disturbance of this barrier provides vaginal bacteria access to the upper genital organs, infecting the endometrium, then endosalpinx, ovarian cortex, pelvic peritoneum, and their underlying stroma. The resulting infection may be subclinical or manifest as the clinical entity of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The reasons why lower genital tract bacteria cause PID in some women but not others is not fully understood but may relate to genetic variations in immune response, estrogen levels affecting the viscosity of cervical mucus, and bacterial load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Patients with PID can present with clinical disease at any point along a continuum from endometritis (with normal tubes, ovaries, and peritoneum) to salpingitis (with inflammation of the fallopian tubes and adjacent pelvic structures). This limits the sensitivity of direct visualization of the fallopian tubes through laparoscopy when making a diagnosis of PID because endometritis and mild intratubal inflammation cannot be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Very rare pathogens identified include <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and the agents of actinomycosis. However, in most cases, the precise microbial etiology of PID is unknown. Regardless of the initiating pathogen, PID is clinically considered a mixed infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> was the first identified cause of PID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 15 percent of women with an endocervical <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> infection go on to develop PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The proportion of PID caused by <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> varies widely and reflects the underlying prevalence of gonorrhoea in the local population. Its importance tends to be higher in the southeastern United States, less in the northwestern United States and much less in western Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. There has been a steady evolution of multidrug resistant strains since the early 1980s, and a third of United States isolates currently carry some form of drug resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gonococcal PID tends to be clinically more severe than chlamydia PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], which may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chlamydia trachomatis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genital chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmissible disease. In the United States, it is also the most common reportable infectious disease, with approximately 1.5 million cases reported annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <em>C. trachomatis</em> accounts for about one-third of cases of PID, with less geographic variation in the prevalence than that seen for gonorrhea-associated PID.</p><p>As seen with genital gonococcal infections in women, about 10 to 15 percent of endocervical <em>C. trachomatis</em> infections produce PID, but asymptomatic subclinical infections are also common, and these may present years later as chronic pelvic pain or infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections#H22688584\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;, section on 'Pelvic inflammatory disease'</a>.)</p><p>Women aged 16 to 24 years account for most cases of chlamydia. In one report of 150,000 such women, those at the lowest risk still had a 6 percent prevalence of genital chlamydia, which accounted for 17 percent of infections in this sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Many, but not all studies have shown a reduction in PID rates following the introduction of chlamydia screening in young women. As an example, annual chlamydia screening and treatment among at-risk 18 to 34 year-old women reduced the prevalence of PID by 56 percent (8 versus 18 per 10,000 woman-months) compared with those managed traditionally by risk and symptomatic assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Annual screening of sexually active adolescent girls and young women and older women at increased risk for chlamydia is recommended in the United States and other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

There is growing evidence supporting an association with cervicitis and PID in women. The proportion of PID cases that are associated with <em>M. genitalium</em> is uncertain; in one study of women with mild to moderate PID in the United Kingdom, 10 percent tested positive for <em>M. genitalium </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Using molecular amplification with generic primers, a number of novel bacteria have been identified in the fallopian tubes of women with PID, including Atopobium, Sneathia, and Leptotrichia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The role of these and other anaerobic bacteria in the pathogenesis of PID remains to be proven. </p><p>Investigations of various other mycoplasma species, such as Mycoplasma hominis, have been fueled by the ability of these organisms to cause urethritis in the male, but their relevance to PID is not yet clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the initiating pathogen, the microbiology of PID, especially for clinical purposes, should be viewed and treated as a mixed (facultative and anaerobic) polymicrobial infection. Older studies isolated groups A and B streptococci (rarely enterococci), <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella </em>spp, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, <em>Haemophilus</em> spp, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">Bacteroides/Prevotella</em></span> spp, <em>Peptococcus</em>, and <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> spp from women with PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. These studies found that, among cases of PID initiated by <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, a mixed polymicrobial infection was seen in approximately 35 percent. Another study, which employed particularly stringent microbiologic techniques, identified other organisms in more than 50 percent of patients with gonococcal PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>In a given patient with PID, different organisms can be isolated from the various levels of the genital tract (ie, the organisms isolated from the upper genital tract may be distinct from those isolated from the lower genital tract) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/20,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex is the primary risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Celibate women are not at risk for PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and women with longstanding monogamous relationships rarely develop PID. On the other hand, women with multiple sexual partners are at the highest risk. Younger age, past infection with chlamydia, a partner with a STI, and previous PID are other important risk factors. The frequency of PID is also affected by the method of contraceptive used; barrier contraception is protective.</p><p>In the United States, African-American or Black-Caribbean ethnicity has been associated with a higher risk of PID. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial, possibly related to access to care or behavioral differences. These racial differences in PID risk may be decreasing over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple partners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of multiple partners was illustrated by a study that compared 712 women hospitalized for PID with 2719 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Having four or more sexual partners within the prior six months increased the risk of PID 3.4 times, and having sex with a single partner six or more times per week increased it 3.2 times. Other studies have confirmed multiple partners as a risk factor, associated with an increased frequency of PID ranging from 3- to 20-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. One report, however, did not confirm a role for coital frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">STI in the partner</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately a third of men with gonococcal or chlamydial urethritis are asymptomatic. Having a symptomatic (dysuria, urethral discharge) male partner can increase a woman's risk of PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PID occurs in highest frequency among those 15 to 25 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/10,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32</a>]; the incidence in women older than the age of 35 is only one-seventh that in younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The initiating pathogens of PID in both the United States and Europe, particularly <em>C. trachomatis</em>, are densely concentrated among adolescent and young adult women, with prevalence around 3 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/11,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,34</a>]. <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> are less likely to be identified in post-menopausal women, in whom the risk of PID is very low. In such women, it is important to consider alternate diagnoses including ovarian cancer, fibroids, diverticulitis, and colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Reinfection with genital <em>C. trachomatis</em> is also a function of age. In one series, for example, the risk of reinfection among women whose first infection occurred at &lt;15 years and 15 to 19 years was eightfold (at 54 percent) and fivefold (at 30 percent) greater, respectively, compared to those whose first infection occurred older than age 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous PID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one in four women with PID will suffer recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In one study, a previous episode of PID increased the risk for subsequent episodes by a factor of 2.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, these data must be used cautiously in practice, since PID is associated with an increased risk of subsequent chronic pelvic pain in general, even in the absence of an identifiable new infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraceptive method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of contraceptive method does not clearly affect the risk of pelvic infection, although consistent use of condoms offers a significant reduction of risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Barrier contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barrier contraception protects against PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Condoms are the most effective form, preventing over 50 percent of endocervical gonococcal and chlamydial infections if used correctly. One large study suggested that consistent condom use following a diagnosis of PID can lower the rate of PID sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Unfortunately, most women do not consistently use condoms. According to survey data reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2002 to 2007, consistent condom use was reported in only 31 percent of never-married women aged 20 to 24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral contraceptives (OCs) have a complex interaction with PID. Several studies have shown that OC use nearly doubles the prevalence of both chlamydia and gonococcal infection of the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, OC use has traditionally been associated with a 50 percent reduction in PID risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Among OC users with cervical infection, asymptomatic endometritis is fourfold more common than among their counterparts not using OCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], although gross salpingitis is reduced fivefold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Thus, women using OCs appear to develop PID about as frequently as other women, but the severity of the infection is substantially diminished.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrauterine device and tubal ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modern intrauterine devices cause little, if any, increased risk for PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. The risk of PID is primarily limited to the first three weeks after IUD insertion and is uncommon thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. One low quality trial suggested that IUD removal in the setting of PID results in better clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], but most guidelines note that leaving the IUD in place while treating acute PID with antibiotics is acceptable with close follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The IUD should be removed if clinical improvement is delayed beyond a few days.</p><p>Long-term indwelling IUDs have been associated with pelvic actinomycosis, a rare disease that can present as a pelvic mass with weight loss and constitutional symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a study of 475 isolates of actinomyces species, 30 percent of the clinical specimens originated in association with IUDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The decision to treat a patient for possible pelvic actinomycosis is influenced by the presence or absence of clinical symptoms, since actinomyces are part of normal vaginal flora.

Regardless of the initiating event, the microbiology of PID should be viewed and treated as a mixed (facultative and anaerobic) polymicrobial infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease is having unprotected intercourse with multiple sex partners. The choice of contraceptive method does not clearly affect the risk of pelvic infection, though consistent use of condoms offers a significant reduction of risk. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Charles Livengood, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
