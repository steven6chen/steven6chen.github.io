In the pre-vaccine era, the disease predominantly affected children &lt;10 years of age and usually manifested as a prolonged cough illness with one or more of the classical symptoms including inspiratory whoop, paroxysmal cough, and posttussive emesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Since the introduction of pertussis vaccines, the epidemiology of reported pertussis infections has changed; in the United States in the 1990s, more than one-half of cases occurred in adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infected adolescents and adults can serve as a reservoir for infection of infants and children, who more often experience serious morbidity and mortality. Because symptoms and signs in adolescents and adults are often nonspecific, clinicians may not consider the diagnosis of pertussis.</p><p>Issues related to treatment and prevention of pertussis in adolescents and adults will be reviewed here. Issues related to treatment and prevention of pertussis in infants and children are discussed separately.

Antibiotic treatment given during the early (catarrhal) phase may decrease the duration and severity of cough, but the diagnosis is rarely established during this phase among adolescents and adults. Antibiotic treatment later in the course of disease probably does not affect the course of symptoms but may be useful to reduce the spread of the infection to others.</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published recommendations for treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In general, antibiotic therapy is warranted for patients within three weeks of cough onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For individuals with persistent cough for three to six weeks, antibiotic treatment may not reduce cough duration or severity but could reduce likelihood of pertussis transmission to others. Therefore, for pregnant women, healthcare workers, and individuals working with infants, antibiotic therapy is appropriate for those with persistent cough for up to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p>Given the highly contagious nature of the disease and the delay in availability of culture test results (which may take 7 to 10 days), we agree with the CDC that the threshold for initiating testing should be the same as for initiating treatment. Thus, in the setting of sufficient clinical suspicion for pertussis, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated at the same time that diagnostic testing is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The antibiotic regimens for treatment and postexposure prophylaxis are identical.

The cough is likely due to destruction of respiratory ciliated cells by pertussis toxins; this leads to trickling of secretions from the nasopharynx into the larynx, triggering the cough reflex. Cough resolution requires regrowth of these cells, which may take many weeks. There is no proven effective therapy for symptomatic treatment of severe cough. A systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the use of an antihistamine, beta2-receptor agonist, or pertussis immunoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In addition, since June 2012, the ACIP has recommended that adults aged 65 years and older who have not previously received Tdap should receive a single booster administration with Tdap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. This is particularly important for older adults who have close contact with infants aged younger than one year (such as grandparents, childcare providers, and healthcare providers). Rates of Tdap coverage among adults with children in their household appear to be low but are substantially higher for patients whose providers recommend the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other adults for whom vaccination is particularly important include those with obesity and preexisting asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Either Tdap formulation (Boostrix or Adacel) can be administered to a person 65 years or older; Boostrix is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, providers should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate an individual aged 65 years and older so should administer whichever Tdap vaccine is available. Prior to the ACIP recommendations issued in June 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved Boostrix for individuals aged 10 years and older and Adacel for individuals between 11 and 64 years of age. Subsequent data has indicated that immunization of adults aged &ge;65 years did not have untoward safety consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition, in 2014, the FDA extended the lower age limit for Adacel from 11 to 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Tdap should be administered regardless of the interval since the last dose of Td. This represents a change from previous ACIP guidelines, which recommended that Tdap be given a minimum of two years after the last dose of Td in most cases. Subsequent tetanus booster doses, in the form of Td, should be given at 10-year intervals throughout adulthood.</p><p>If it is not possible to determine whether an adult has had a Tdap booster, it is reasonable to proceed with administration and documentation of Tdap.</p><p>The effectiveness of the Tdap vaccine in adolescents has been shown to wane within two to four years of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This likely contributes to the increased incidence of pertussis observed in adolescents. Administration of a second Tdap dose to young adults 10 years after the first dose appears to be safe and immunogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], though has not been recommended given lack of evidence that this approach will reduce the overall burden of pertussis or be cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Tdap booster vaccination is appropriate even for patients who have had a recent clinical episode of pertussis.</p><p>Contraindications to the Tdap vaccine include prior severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) after a vaccine dose or to a vaccine component or encephalopathy (not attributable to an alternate cause) that occurred within seven days of a pertussis-containing vaccination.

Antibiotic treatment later in the course of disease (when the diagnosis is usually established) probably does not affect the course of symptoms but may be useful to reduce the spread of the infection. (See <a href=\"#H12882597\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the highly contagious nature of pertussis and the delay in availability of culture results (which may take 7 to 10 days), in the setting of sufficient clinical suspicion for pertussis, initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy may be appropriate depending on the duration of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H12882597\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected pertussis and cough duration of &le;3 weeks, we recommend antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For individuals with persistent cough for three to six weeks, antibiotic treatment may not reduce cough duration or severity but could reduce likelihood of pertussis transmission to others. Therefore, for pregnant women, healthcare workers, and individuals working with infants, we suggest antibiotic therapy for individuals with persistent cough up to six weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12882597\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial therapy for treatment of pertussis is outlined in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75339\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75339 \">table 1</a>). We suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>); these are better tolerated and have more convenient dosing than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>. For patients who cannot tolerate macrolide antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> is an acceptable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H12882611\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend booster vaccination with Tdap for adolescents and adults (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Vaccination is particularly important for individuals who have close contact with infants aged younger than one year (such as grandparents, childcare providers, and healthcare providers). (See <a href=\"#H5842133\" class=\"local\">'Tdap booster'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend postexposure prophylaxis for individuals (including healthcare personnel) in close contact with cases of pertussis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>); the prophylaxis regimen is the same as the treatment regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75339\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75339 \">table 1</a>). Prior vaccination with Tdap should not be considered sufficiently protective to eliminate the need for chemoprophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H12882709\" class=\"local\">'Postexposure prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with <em>B. pertussis</em> infection should avoid contact with young children and infants until they have completed at least five days of effective antibiotic therapy. Similarly, patients working in schools, daycare centers, or healthcare facilities should not return to work until they have received five days of antibiotic treatment. (See <a href=\"#H14100668\" class=\"local\">'Other control measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18284597\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. Christopher Ohl, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">G&uuml;ri&#351; D, Strebel PM, Bardenheier B, et al.
