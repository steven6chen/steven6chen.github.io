For most patients, treatment will be palliative and not curative (a fact that may not be understood by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]), and the treatment goals are to prolong overall survival and maintain quality of life (QOL) for as long as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9654802\"><span class=\"h2\">Potentially resectable disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>However, some patients with stage IV disease (particularly those with liver-limited metastases) can be surgically cured of their disease. Even selected patients with initially unresectable liver metastases may become eligible for resection if the response to chemotherapy is sufficient. </p><p>This approach has been termed &quot;conversion therapy&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] to distinguish it from &quot;neoadjuvant therapy,&quot; which applies to preoperative chemotherapy given to patients who present upfront with apparently resectable disease. The key parameter for selecting the specific regimen in this scenario is not survival or improved QOL, but instead, response rate (ie, the ability of the regimen to shrink metastases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In the palliative setting, objective response rate is not the best indicator of treatment benefit (prolonged survival <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression-free survival [PFS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Thus, achieving stable disease as the best response to therapy might be considered a treatment success. (See <a href=\"#H183911707\" class=\"local\">'Assessment during therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients benefit more from access to all active agents than from a particular treatment sequence of specific regimens used as individual &quot;lines&quot; of therapy. In all large published phase III trials testing various combinations of cytotoxic agents and targeted agents conducted over the last decade, the proportion of patients receiving all active agents has correlated strongly with median survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Although no such analysis has yet been performed after the introduction of biologic agents, it is conceivable that the overall principle of optimizing outcomes through exposure to all active agents is still valid. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite these findings, the available evidence suggests that only a minority of American patients with mCRC are exposed to all active agents in the course of their therapy for mCRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the survival benefit from second- and even third-line chemotherapy, the routine practice of crossover in clinical trials severely limits the ability to detect an overall survival advantage of one treatment regimen over another. Therefore, the actual activity of a new agent or combination regimen is better captured by the endpoint PFS, in particular in the first-line setting. Improvements in PFS correlate with longer survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] and are not affected by crossover or subsequent therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These concepts can be illustrated by results from the EPIC trial, in which patients failing initial oxaliplatin-based therapy were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There were significant differences in PFS, objective response, and disease control rates that favored combined therapy, but no overall survival advantage. This was attributed to the fact that 50 percent of the patients in the irinotecan arm crossed over to cetuximab at progression.

These benefits are most pronounced with regimens containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> in combination with FU. Although no trial has compared these regimens with BSC alone, median survival durations in clinical trials of oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy now consistently exceed two years; in contrast, for patients with unresectable metastatic (mCRC) who receive best supportive care (BSC) alone, median survival is approximately five to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>Accumulating data suggest that long-term survival may also be improving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Regimens such as these are associated with clear-cut survival benefits, particularly if patients are serially exposed to all active agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Treatment recommendations&quot;, section on 'Initial doublet combinations versus sequential single agents'</a>.)</p><p>The only available data from the era of modern chemotherapy come from a retrospective report of 736 patients with mCRC diagnosed between January 2003 and December 2010 at a single Australian center; 377 (51 percent) received immediate chemotherapy, 167 (23 percent) did not because they were deemed inappropriate for therapy or refused, and 192 (26 percent) adopted a &quot;watch and wait&quot; policy initially, 168 of whom eventually received chemotherapy (at a median of 3.7 months from diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Compared with immediate treatment, the fraction of patients in the delayed chemotherapy group who eventually received treatment with all active agents was slightly less (30 versus 39 percent), but the median survival was superior (27 versus 17 months).</p><p>Importantly, these data are not from a randomized trial, and interpretation is limited by the potential for selection bias (ie, patients who had treatment deferred were likely to be those with favorable biology [asymptomatic, lower volume metastatic disease, better performance status]), all of which could have contributed to the longer survival in this group. At least in the United States, most patients institute treatment at a time when they are still asymptomatic from their cancer. An alternate approach, which may be particularly appropriate for asymptomatic elderly patients, is an initial period of observation to judge the tempo of disease progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23214887\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMOTHERAPY DOSING IN OBESE PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For cancer patients with a large body surface area (BSA), chemotherapy drug doses are often reduced because of concern for excess toxicity. However, there is no evidence that fully-dosed obese patients experience greater toxicity from chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC); furthermore, obese patients who are given reduced doses may have inferior outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although limited, the available data do not support the policy of routine dose reduction (or capping the maximal BSA to 2.0 m<sup>2</sup>) for obese patients with mCRC. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend that full weight-based cytotoxic chemotherapy doses be used to treat obese patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In general, the decision to permit treatment breaks during therapy must be individualized and based upon several factors, including tolerance of and response to chemotherapy, disease bulk and location, and symptomatology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many patients with small volume but multiple sites of disease who respond to chemotherapy or have a prolonged period of disease stability. Even if their disease triples in volume off therapy, they will not likely be symptomatic or develop organ dysfunction.

These patients may be better approached with continuous chemotherapy.

This typically meant that patients were treated for four to six months (the median progression-free survival duration) and then were placed on supportive care alone until they died (median duration of survival approximately one year).</p><p>Compared with FU alone, newer combinations are more effective (median survival durations now consistently approach two years), but they are also more toxic. This is particularly true for oxaliplatin-containing regimens, which cause cumulative neurotoxicity; several studies have shown that more patients come off of therapy because of toxic effects than because of progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This is particularly problematic for regimens that include antiangiogenic therapy; the available data suggest that patients who receive treatment to tumor progression derive the greatest benefit from the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> to the chemotherapy backbone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Intermittent rather than continuous chemotherapy has the potential to improve outcomes and reduce toxicity as well as cost.</p><p>Whether continued chemotherapy provides better outcomes than intermittent therapy to best response followed by a chemotherapy &quot;holiday&quot; has been addressed in several trials, most of which have studied chemotherapy regimens that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, a drug that is associated with dose-limiting neurotoxicity.

Continuation of oxaliplatin is an alternative for responding patients who have no clinically significant neuropathy.

These recommendations are consistent with consensus-based guidelines for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site&amp;token=KVRKaAygvvJD1E58VlEWX1VnwiMJk6ES6siEg2ZEkxcvEZXJ0oPqqP7nnraF23B1m3ddPGRG+/OILdUZuWaBR7bvmNwO/yMFZatbDyoIztg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15802\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a> (NCCN). &#160;</p><p>A complete break in therapy may also be reasonable if a complete clinical response is observed, or for those with small volume metastatic disease who have a partial response or stable disease to the initial course of chemotherapy.

Radiographic tumor response is usually quantified using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74693 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Persistently rising CEA levels (particularly rapidly rising levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]) are highly correlated with disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. However, 2006 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggest confirmatory radiologic studies in this setting prior to a change in therapeutic strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Caution should be used when interpreting a rising CEA level during the first four to six weeks of a new therapy, since spurious early elevation in serum CEA may occur, especially after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].</p><p>Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the fraction of circulating DNA that is derived from a patient's cancer. Colorectal cancers shed DNA into the blood, and interest in using ctDNA as a surrogate indicator of treatment response has grown as techniques to detect and quantify such DNA have improved. At least one early report suggests that a decrease in levels of ctDNA after chemotherapy is associated with higher objective response rates and longer median progression-free survival and may represent a sensitive and specific marker of therapeutic efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, there is not yet enough known about the mechanisms controlling ctDNA change and how well radiologic responses and ctDNA markers correlate with each other to understand whether ctDNA can replace or supplement periodic assay of CEA or radiologic assessment. </p><p>A year 2018 joint review of the utility of ctDNA analysis in patients with cancer by ASCO and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) concluded that there is insufficient evidence of clinical validity and utility for the majority of ctDNA assays in advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Few large prospective validation studies have been performed on ctDNA-based treatment monitoring. At least in advanced breast cancer, there are some data that suggest that ctDNA responses do not always parallel imaging-based responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-general-principles/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], and no studies convincingly demonstrate improved patient outcomes or any cost savings when compared with standard of care monitoring approaches. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4022878823\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Systemic chemotherapy produces meaningful improvements in survival that are most pronounced in patients who are exposed to all active drugs. The available agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, parenteral and oral fluoropyrimidines, therapies targeting angiogenesis (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramucirumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramucirumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regorafenib</a>), and therapies that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panitumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">panitumumab</a>). Although no trial has compared any of these regimens with BSC alone, median survivals now far exceed five to six months, going beyond two years. (See <a href=\"#H183911606\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy versus supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p>The best way to combine and sequence these agents is still not established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Treatment recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9659590\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goals of chemotherapy for mCRC differ according to the clinical scenario (see <a href=\"#H9654617\" class=\"local\">'Treatment goals'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, treatment will be palliative and not curative, and the treatment goals are to prolong overall survival and maintain quality of life (QOL) for as long as possible. Exposure to all active agents provides the most optimal outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H9654809\" class=\"local\">'Nonresectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, some patients with stage IV disease (particularly those with liver-limited metastases) can be surgically cured of their disease. Even selected patients with initially unresectable liver metastases may become eligible for resection if the response to chemotherapy is sufficient. In such cases, the key parameter for selecting a specific regimen is not survival or improved QOL, but instead, response rate (ie, the ability of the regimen to shrink metastases).

(See <a href=\"#H183911613\" class=\"local\">'Timing of chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full weight-based cytotoxic chemotherapy doses should be used for the treatment of obese patients with mCRC.

In general, the decision to permit treatment breaks during therapy must be individualized and based upon several factors, including tolerance of and response to chemotherapy, disease bulk and location, and symptomatology. (See <a href=\"#H183911620\" class=\"local\">'Continuous versus intermittent therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are responding to an oxaliplatin-based initial regimen, it is reasonable to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> before the onset of severe neurotoxicity (usually after three to four months of therapy). Continuation of oxaliplatin is another alternative for responding patients who have no clinically significant neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H183911634\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who choose to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, we suggest maintenance therapy with a fluoropyrimidine with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> rather than a complete break in therapy and reintroduction of oxaliplatin at disease progression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Based on the efficacy and toxicity data of CAIRO3, maintenance therapy with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (625 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> twice daily continuously) plus bevacizumab (7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every three weeks) is a reasonable option in this setting. We do not suggest use of bevacizumab alone for maintenance therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H183911634\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H114993092\" class=\"local\">'CAIRO3 trial'</a> above and <a href=\"#H93500092\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance bevacizumab alone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete break in therapy may be reasonable if a complete clinical response is observed or for those with small volume metastatic disease who have a partial response or stable disease to the initial course of chemotherapy. In such cases, close follow-up with tumor assessment at two month intervals and early resumption of chemotherapy at the first sign of progression is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While treatment approaches that include intermittent breaks from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> appear to be almost mandatory for the majority of patients receiving oxaliplatin because of cumulative neurotoxicity, the advantages of intermittent treatment with irinotecan-based regimens are less clear. For most patients, we continue treatment for as long as tumor shrinkage continues and treatment is tolerable. Nevertheless, intermittent treatment does not appear to compromise outcomes and could be considered in responding patients with or without maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>.
