But if you have pain or are worried about your problems, there are treatments that can help.</p><p>Some women have problems with sex throughout their adult life. Other women develop problems later in life. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543819782\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes sex problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex problems can be caused by many things. For instance, a woman might have sex problems if she has problems with her partner or in her relationship.</p><p>Sex problems can also be linked to medical events in a woman's life. For instance, sex can be painful for a woman in the weeks or months after she gives birth. And some women lose interest in sex or have pain with sex as they get older or after they go through menopause. (Menopause is the time in a woman's life when she stops having monthly periods.)</p><p>Certain conditions can also lead to sex problems. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dryness or pain in the vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the lower belly, such as from an infection, past surgery, or a condition called endometriosis (women with this condition often also have painful periods)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the muscles near and around the vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood problems, such as depression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical problems, such as cancer or heart problems</p><p/><p>Sex problems can also be a side effect of certain medicines. For example, medicines to treat depression or heart disease sometimes cause sex problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543819789\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to improve my sex problem?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are having relationship problems, you can try to improve your relationship with your partner. For example, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk to your partner about how to make sex better</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make an effort to have more fun together by having a regular &quot;date night&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read books or websites about sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Go to counseling</p><p/><p>Women with pain or dryness during sex often feel better if they use vaginal lubricants. These are sold without a prescription. Lubricants are used during sex. Examples include K-Y Jelly and Astroglide. If using a lubricant is not enough, a woman can also use a vaginal moisturizer. Vaginal moisturizers are used several times a week, but not necessarily during sex. Examples include Replens and K-Y SILK-E.</p><p>It is also important to stay as healthy as possible and get treated for any medical problems you have. Women who feel healthy and happy are more likely to be happy with their sex life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543819796\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you don't know why you are having sex problems, your doctor or nurse can help you figure it out. He or she will talk with you and do an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543819803\"><span class=\"h1\">How are sex problems treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex problems can be treated in different ways. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers or a prescription cream (usually estrogen) to treat vaginal dryness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting treatment for mood problems, if you have mood problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working with your doctor to change any medicines you take that might be causing sex problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having physical therapy to loosen the muscles around your vagina so that you do not have pain during sex</p><p/><p>In addition, some women who have gone through menopause are helped by taking hormone medicines.</p><p>You might have heard about a medicine that can help some women with sex problems. This medicine is called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flibanserin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">flibanserin</a> (brand name: Addyi). It was approved in 2015 for use in the United States. It is meant only for certain women who have not yet gone through menopause and who have a low desire for sex that is causing them stress. Flibanserin must be prescribed by a doctor, and comes in a pill that you take every night at bedtime. It can help some women desire sex more, but there can be serious side effects. For example, some women have problems with tiredness, nausea, dizziness, or headache. You cannot drink alcohol if you are taking this medicine. Alcohol and certain medicines can increase the risk of side effects. In most cases, doctors recommend trying other things to improve your relationship and sex life before trying medicine.</p><p>Some treatments are not recommended by doctors. For example, doctors do not usually recommend that women take the medicines that men take for sex problems. Also, most doctors do not recommend that women use herbal treatments to improve sex.</p><p>Some medicines for treating sex problems are sold over the internet. However, these are not always safe, and they can even contain harmful ingredients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543819810\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartholins-gland-cyst-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bartholin's gland cyst (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-as-you-get-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex as you get older (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sjogrens-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvar pain (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Menopausal hormone therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
