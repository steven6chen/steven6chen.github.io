In a systematic review, it was seen in 6 to 11 percent of patients with symptomatic gallstones over a median follow-up of 7 to 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The management of uncomplicated gallstone disease, acalculous cholecystitis, and the treatment of acute cholecystitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acalculous cholecystitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term cholecystitis refers to inflammation of the gallbladder. It may develop acutely in association with gallstones (acute cholecystitis) or, less often, without gallstones (acalculous cholecystitis). It may also develop over time and be discovered histologically following cholecystectomy (chronic cholecystitis). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute cholecystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cholecystitis refers to a syndrome of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis associated with gallbladder inflammation that is usually related to gallstone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acalculous cholecystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acalculous cholecystitis is clinically identical to acute cholecystitis but is not associated with gallstones and usually occurs in critically ill patients. It accounts for approximately 10 percent of cases of acute cholecystitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acalculous-cholecystitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acalculous cholecystitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cholecystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic cholecystitis is the term used to describe chronic inflammatory cell infiltration of the gallbladder seen on histopathology. It is almost invariably associated with the presence of gallstones and is thought to be the result of mechanical irritation or recurrent attacks of acute cholecystitis leading to fibrosis and thickening of the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Its presence does not correlate with symptoms since patients with extensive chronic inflammatory cell inflammation may have only minimal symptoms, and there is no evidence that chronic cholecystitis increases the risk for future morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hence, the clinical significance of this entity is questionable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some authors use the phrase &quot;chronic cholecystitis&quot; when referring to gallbladder dysfunction as a cause of abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is more appropriate in this instance to refer to the condition based on the disorder present, such as pain due to gallstone disease, pain due to biliary dyskinesia (which is attributed to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction), or pain due to functional gallbladder disorder (also called gallbladder dyskinesia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-gallbladder-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional gallbladder disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cholecystitis occurs in the setting of cystic duct obstruction. However, in contrast to biliary colic, the development of acute cholecystitis is not fully explained by cystic duct obstruction alone. Studies suggest that an additional irritant (possibly lysolecithin) is required to develop gallbladder inflammation. Once inflammation of the gallbladder begins, additional inflammatory mediators are released, further propagating gallbladder inflammation. In many patients, infection of the biliary system is also involved in the development of acute cholecystitis.</p><p>Studies in animals have demonstrated that ligation of the cystic duct alone does not result in acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, acute cholecystitis can be produced by blocking the cystic duct, followed by deliberate irritation of the gallbladder mucosa (either mechanically with an indwelling catheter or by infusion of an irritant).</p><p>One such irritant used in experimental models, lysolecithin, is produced from lecithin, a normal constituent of bile. The production of lysolecithin from lecithin is catalyzed by phospholipase A, which is present in gallbladder mucosa. This enzyme may be released into the gallbladder following trauma to the gallbladder wall from an impacted gallstone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that lysolecithin (normally absent in bile) is detectable in gallbladder bile in patients with acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Inflammatory mediators are released in response to gallbladder inflammation and further propagate the inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Prostaglandins, which are involved in gallbladder contraction and fluid absorption, probably play a central role in this process. In experimental models using human gallbladder tissue, the main prostaglandins synthesized by inflamed human gallbladder microsomes were prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, the concentrations of which were increased four times above normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prostaglandin hypothesis is supported by the observation that prostaglandin inhibitors relieve biliary colic and can reduce intraluminal cystic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Infection of bile within the biliary system probably has a role in the development of cholecystitis; however, not all patients with cholecystitis have infected bile. This observation was illustrated in a study of 467 subjects in whom bile samples were obtained from the gallbladder and common bile duct for aerobic and anaerobic culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with a variety of hepatobiliary diseases and a healthy control group were included. Patients with gallstones, acute cholecystitis, and hydropic gallbladder had similar rates of positive cultures in the gallbladder and common bile duct, ranging from 22 to 46 percent; cultures were generally sterile in healthy subjects. The main species isolated were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter.</p><p>Histologic changes of the gallbladder in acute cholecystitis can range from mild edema and acute inflammation to necrosis and gangrene. Occasionally, prolonged impaction of a stone in the cystic duct can lead to a distended gallbladder that is filled with colorless, mucoid fluid. This condition, known as a mucocele with white bile (hydrops), is due to the absence of bile entry into the gallbladder and absorption of all the bilirubin within the gallbladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of acute cholecystitis include prolonged (more than four to six hours), steady, severe right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, fever, abdominal guarding, a positive Murphy's sign, and leukocytosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249918499\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute cholecystitis typically complain of abdominal pain, most commonly in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. The pain may radiate to the right shoulder or back. Characteristically, acute cholecystitis pain is steady and severe. Associated complaints may include fever, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. There is often a history of fatty food ingestion one hour or more before the initial onset of pain. The episode of pain is typically prolonged (greater than four to six hours).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute cholecystitis are usually ill appearing, febrile, and tachycardic, and lie still on the examining table because cholecystitis is associated with true local parietal peritoneal inflammation that is aggravated by movement. Abdominal examination usually demonstrates voluntary and involuntary guarding. Patients frequently will have a positive Murphy's sign. (See <a href=\"#H63322883\" class=\"local\">'Murphy's sign'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with complications may have signs of sepsis (gangrene), generalized peritonitis (perforation), abdominal crepitus (emphysematous cholecystitis), or bowel obstruction (gallstone ileus). (See <a href=\"#H249918843\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Sepsis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H939842446\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Gallstones or foreign body'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H413451751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249919411\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically have a leukocytosis with an increased number of band forms (ie, a left shift). Elevation in the serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations are <strong>not</strong> common in uncomplicated acute cholecystitis since biliary obstruction is limited to the gallbladder; if present, they should raise concerns about complicating conditions such as cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, or Mirizzi syndrome (a gallstone impacted in the distal cystic duct causing extrinsic compression of the common bile duct) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86878\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86878 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirizzi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mirizzi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, there have been reports of mild elevations in serum aminotransferases and amylase, along with hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice, even in the absence of these complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These abnormalities may be due to the passage of small stones, sludge, or pus.</p><p>In patients with emphysematous cholecystitis, mild to moderate unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may be present because of hemolysis induced by clostridial infection. (See <a href=\"#H249918905\" class=\"local\">'Emphysematous cholecystitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cholecystitis should be suspected in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, fever, and a leukocytosis. A positive Murphy's sign supports the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, history, physical examination, and laboratory test findings are not sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires demonstration of gallbladder wall thickening or edema, a sonographic Murphy's sign, or failure of the gallbladder to fill during cholescintigraphy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50032\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50032 \">algorithm 1</a>). In most cases, the diagnosis can be confirmed with an abdominal ultrasound. If the diagnosis remains unclear, cholescintigraphy can be obtained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63322883\"><span class=\"h2\">Murphy's sign</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute cholecystitis frequently have a positive &quot;Murphy's sign&quot;. To check for a Murphy's sign, the patient is asked to inspire deeply while the examiner palpates the area of the gallbladder fossa just beneath the liver edge. Deep inspiration causes the gallbladder to descend toward and press against the examining fingers, which in patients with acute cholecystitis commonly leads to increased discomfort and the patient catching his or her breath. </p><p>In one study, using cholescintigraphy as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of a positive Murphy's sign were 97 and 48 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the sensitivity may be diminished in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination alone cannot determine which abdominal viscera is the source of inflammation and pain. Thus, patients presenting with clinical features suggestive of acute cholecystitis should undergo abdominal imaging to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasonography is usually the first test obtained and can often establish the diagnosis. Nuclear cholescintigraphy may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis remains uncertain after ultrasonography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of stones in the gallbladder in the clinical setting of right upper quadrant abdominal pain and fever supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis but is not diagnostic. Additional sonographic features include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallbladder wall thickening (greater than 4 to 5 mm) or edema (double wall sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83042\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83042 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;sonographic Murphy's sign&quot; is similar to the Murphy's sign elicited during abdominal palpation, except that the positive response is observed during palpation with the ultrasound transducer. This is more accurate than hand palpation because it can confirm that it is indeed the gallbladder that is being pressed by the imaging transducer when the patient catches his or her breath.</p><p/><p>Several studies have evaluated the accuracy of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21-26</a>]. A particularly informative systematic review summarized the results of 30 studies of ultrasonography for gallstones and acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Adjusted sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were 88 percent (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74 to 1.00) and 80 percent (95% CI 0.62 to 0.98), respectively.</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for detection of gallstones are approximately 84 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.92) and 99 percent (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Ultrasonography may not detect small stones or sludge as illustrated by a study that compared ultrasonography with direct percutaneous mini-endoscopy in patients who had undergone topical gallstone dissolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Ultrasonography was negative in 12 of 13 patients in whom endoscopy demonstrated 1 to 3 mm stones or fragments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65714\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65714 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In patients with emphysematous cholecystitis, the ultrasound report may erroneously note the presence of &quot;overlying bowel gas making adequate visualization of the gallbladder difficult&quot;, when in reality, this reflects air in the wall of the gallbladder. (See <a href=\"#H249918905\" class=\"local\">'Emphysematous cholecystitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Contrast enhanced ultrasonography performed in conjunction with intravenous injection of an ultrasound contrast agent containing microbubbles is advocated by some to allow the preoperative detection of gangrenous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Theoretically, early diagnosis of this serious complication of acute cholecystitis would lead to better planning of early intervention to prevent further more serious complications; however, this test is not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholescintigraphy using 99mTc-hepatic iminodiacetic acid (generically referred to as a HIDA scan) is indicated if the diagnosis remains uncertain following ultrasonography. Technetium labeled hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) is injected intravenously and is then taken up selectively by hepatocytes and excreted into bile. If the cystic duct is patent, the tracer will enter the gallbladder, leading to its visualization without the need for concentration. The HIDA scan is also useful for demonstrating patency of the common bile duct and ampulla. Normally, visualization of contrast within the common bile duct, gallbladder, and small bowel occurs within 30 to 60 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F59241\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59241 \">image 3</a>). The test is positive if the gallbladder does not visualize. This occurs because of cystic duct obstruction, usually from edema associated with acute cholecystitis or an obstructing stone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86879\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86879 \">image 4</a>).</p><p>Cholescintigraphy has a sensitivity and specificity for acute cholecystitis of approximately 90 to 97 percent and 71 to 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,26,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26,30,31</a>]. Cystic duct obstruction with a stone or tumor in the absence of acute cholecystitis can cause a false positive test. Conditions that can cause false positive results despite a non-obstructed cystic duct include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe liver disease, which may lead to abnormal uptake and excretion of the tracer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasting patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, in whom the gallbladder is already maximally full due to prolonged lack of stimulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary sphincterotomy, which may result in low resistance to bile flow, leading to preferential excretion of the tracer into the duodenum without filling of the gallbladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperbilirubinemia, which may be associated with impaired hepatic clearance of iminodiacetic acid compounds. Newer agents commonly used in cholescintigraphy (diisopropyl and m-bromotrimethyl iminodiacetic acid) have generally overcome this limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>False negative results are uncommon since most patients with acute cholecystitis have obstruction of the cystic duct. When they occur, they may be due to incomplete cystic duct obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Morphine cholescintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A modified version of the HIDA scan has been described in which patients are given intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> during the examination. Morphine increases sphincter of Oddi pressure, thereby causing a more favorable pressure gradient for the radioactive tracer to enter the cystic duct. This modification is thought to be particularly useful in critically ill patients, in whom standard HIDA scanning may be associated with false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. It was compared with the standard HIDA scan in a retrospective study where 365 patients who received 2 mg of morphine prior to the scan were compared with 232 patients who had the standard HIDA scan without morphine pretreatment. The authors reported its accuracy to be slightly more than the standard HIDA scan in detecting acute cholecystitis (93 percent versus 84 percent respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. As the test has not been well standardized and has a high false positive rate, it has not gained wide acceptance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance cholangiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a noninvasive technique for evaluating the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86864\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86864 \">image 5</a>). Its role in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was evaluated in a series that included 35 patients with symptoms of acute cholecystitis who underwent both ultrasound and MRCP prior to cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. MRCP was superior to ultrasound for detecting stones in the cystic duct (sensitivity 100 versus 14 percent) but was less sensitive than ultrasound for detecting gallbladder wall thickening (sensitivity 69 versus 96 percent). At the present time, its role in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis should remain within clinical trials. However, MRCP may be appropriate if there is concern that the patient may have a stone in the common bile duct.

Biliary colic is usually caused by the gallbladder contracting in response to a fatty meal, pressing a stone against the gallbladder outlet or cystic duct opening. This then results in increased intra-gallbladder pressure and pain. As in acute cholecystitis, biliary colic causes pain in the right upper quadrant. However, unlike acute cholecystitis, the pain is entirely visceral in origin, without true gallbladder wall inflammation, so peritoneal signs are absent. In addition, patients with biliary colic are afebrile with normal laboratory studies. As the gallbladder relaxes, the stones often fall back from the cystic duct. As a result, the attack reaches a crescendo over a number of hours and then resolves completely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H8995491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Biliary colic'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients who develop acute cholecystitis have had previous attacks of biliary colic, which may further confuse the diagnosis or lead patients to delay seeking medical attention. The following features may help to distinguish an attack of biliary colic from acute cholecystitis. However, such patients usually require imaging studies to help establish the diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain of biliary colic typically reaches a crescendo, and then resolves completely.
