An acute wound has normal wound physiology and healing is anticipated to progress through the normal stages of wound healing, whereas a chronic wound is defined as one that is physiologically impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>To ensure proper healing, the wound bed needs to be well vascularized, free of devitalized tissue, clear of infection, and moist. Wound dressings should eliminate dead space, control exudate, prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure proper fluid balance, be cost-efficient, and be manageable for the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nursing staff. Wounds that demonstrate progressive healing as evidenced by granulation tissue and epithelialization can undergo closure or coverage. All wounds are colonized with microbes; however, not all wounds are infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>Many topical agents and alternative therapies are available that are meant to improve the wound healing environment and, although data are lacking to support any definitive recommendations, some may be useful under specific circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The basic principles and available options for the management of various wounds will be reviewed. The efficacy of wound management strategies for the treatment of specific wounds is discussed in individual topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of diabetic foot ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;, section on 'Ulcer care'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Wound management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20794882\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20794890\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All wounds are colonized with microbes; however, not all wounds are infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Thus, antibiotic therapy is not indicated for all wounds, and should be reserved for wounds that appear clinically infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is no published evidence to support antibiotic therapy as &quot;prophylaxis&quot; in noninfected chronic wounds, or to improve the healing potential of wounds without clinical evidence of infection. Clinical signs of infection that warrant antibiotic therapy include local (cellulitis, lymphangitic streaking, purulence, malodor, wet gangrene, osteomyelitis, etc.) and systemic (fever, chills, nausea, hypotension, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, confusion) symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Susceptibility to infections in persons with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients at risk for the development of chronic wounds often have comorbid conditions associated with immunocompromised states (eg, diabetes), and may not have classic systemic signs of infection such as fever and leukocytosis on initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In these patients, hyperglycemia may be a more sensitive measure of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268712\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND DEBRIDEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds that have devitalized tissue, contamination, or residual suture material require debridement prior to further wound management. Acute traumatic wounds may have irregular devitalized edges or foreign material within the wound, and surgical wounds that have dehisced may have an infected exudate, bowel contamination, or necrotic muscle or fascia. These materials impede the body's attempt to heal by stimulating the production of abnormal metalloproteases and consuming the local resources necessary for healing. </p><p>Characteristics of chronic wounds that prevent an adequate cellular response to wound-healing stimuli include accumulation of devitalized tissue, decreased angiogenesis, hyperkeratotic tissue, exudate, and biofilm formation (ie, bacterial overgrowth on the surface of the wound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These wounds need planned serial debridement to restore an optimal wound healing environment.</p><p>Wound bed preparation facilitates ordered restoration and regeneration of damaged tissue, and may enhance the function of specialized wound care products and advanced biologic tissue substitutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456665404\"><span class=\"h2\">Irrigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irrigation with fluid is important for decreasing the bacterial load and removing loose material, and should be a part of routine wound management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>]. There is no good evidence to support the use of any particular additive to the irrigant, nor any particular additive over another. The act of irrigation and the volume of irrigant probably provides the positive benefits. Warm, isotonic (normal) saline is typically used; however, systematic reviews have found no significant differences in rates of infection for tap water compared with saline for wound cleansing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The addition of dilute iodine or other antiseptic solutions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite) is generally unnecessary. Such additives have minimal action against bacteria, and some, but not all, may impede wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H369372661\" class=\"local\">'Antiseptics and antimicrobial agents'</a> below.) </p><p>Low pressure irrigation (eg, &lt;15 pounds per square inch [psi]) is usually adequate to remove material from the surface of most wounds. Decreased bacterial load has been documented clinically with the use of pulsed irrigation in lower extremity chronic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Bacteria do not appear to accompany the irrigation fluid into adjacent tissues in animal studies even at higher pressure levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In an experimental model, high-pressure irrigation decreased bacterial levels more than bulb irrigation (average reduction, 70 versus 44 percent) with no increase in the rate of bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For highly contaminated wounds, the benefits of reducing bacterial load may outweigh the risk of speculative adjacent tissue damage associated with the use of higher irrigating pressures. Although higher pressure irrigators may lead to local tissue damage and increased tissue edema, there are no specific data available to suggest a specific cutoff pressure above which tissue damage or impaired, rather than improved, wound healing will occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456663268\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sharp excisional debridement uses a scalpel or other sharp instruments (eg, scissors or curette) to remove devitalized tissue and accumulated debris (biofilm). Sharp excisional debridement of chronic wounds decreases bacterial load and stimulates contraction and wound epithelialization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Surgical debridement is the most appropriate choice for removing large areas of necrotic tissue and is indicated whenever there is any evidence of infection (cellulitis, sepsis). Surgical debridement is also indicated in the management of chronic nonhealing wounds to remove infection, handle undermined wound edges, or obtain deep tissue for culture and pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Serial surgical debridement in a clinical setting, when appropriate, appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. </p><p>In patients with active infection, antibiotic therapy should be targeted and determined by wound culture and sensitivity to decrease the development of bacterial resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with chronic critical limb ischemia, surgical debridement must be coupled with revascularization in order to be successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268733\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzymatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enzymatic debridement involves applying exogenous enzymatic agents to the wound. Many products are commercially available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F85776\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85776 \">table 1</a>), but results of clinical studies are mixed and their use remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Ulcer healing rates are not improved with the use of most topical agents, including debriding enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collagenase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">collagenase</a> may promote endothelial cell and keratinocyte migration, thereby stimulating angiogenesis and epithelialization as its mechanism of action, rather than functioning as a strict debridement agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It also remains a good option in patients who require debridement but are not surgical candidates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361001514\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An additional method of wound debridement uses the larvae of the Australian sheep blow fly (<em>Lucilia [Phaenicia] cuprina</em>) or green bottle fly (<em>Lucilia [Phaenicia] sericata</em>, Medical Maggots, Monarch Labs, Irvine, CA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Maggot therapy can be used as a bridge between debridement procedures, or for debridement of chronic wounds when surgical debridement is not available or cannot be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Maggot therapy may also reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Maggot therapy has been used in the treatment of pressure ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], chronic venous ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>], diabetic ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/38,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,48</a>], and other acute and chronic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The larvae secrete proteolytic enzymes that liquefy necrotic tissue which is subsequently ingested while leaving healthy tissue intact. Basic and clinical research suggests that maggot therapy has additional benefits, including antimicrobial action and stimulation of wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/39,44,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,44,50,51</a>]. However, randomized trials have not found consistent reductions in the time to wound healing compared with standard wound therapy (eg, debridement, hydrogel, moist dressings) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. maggot therapy appears to be at least equivalent to hydrogel in terms of cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Dressing changes include the application of a perimeter dressing and a cover dressing of mesh (chiffon) that helps direct the larvae into the wound and limits their migration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70202\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70202 \">movie 1</a>). Larvae are generally changed every 48 to 72 hours. One study that evaluated maggot therapy in chronic venous wounds found no advantage to continuing maggot therapy beyond one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to maggot therapy (n = 58) or conventional treatment (n = 61). The difference in the slough percentage was significantly increased in the maggot therapy group compared with the control groups at day 8 (67 versus 55 percent), but not at 15 or 30 days.</p><p>The larvae can also be applied within a prefabricated &quot;biobag&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67885\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67885 \">picture 1</a>), commercially available outside the United States, that facilitates application and dressing change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. Randomized trials comparing &quot;free range&quot; with &quot;biobag&quot; contained larvae in the debridement of wounds have not been performed.</p><p>A main disadvantage of maggot therapy relates to negative perceptions about its use by patients and staff. One concern among patients is the possibility that the larvae can escape the dressing, although this rarely occurs. Although one study identified that approximately 50 percent of patients indicated they would prefer conventional wound therapy over maggot therapy, 89 percent of the patients randomly assigned to maggot therapy said they would undergo larval treatment again [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Pain associated with maggot therapy may limit its use in approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268740\"><span class=\"h1\">TOPICAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268755\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth factors important for wound healing include platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

It is approved for use in the United States as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and is the only pharmacological agent approved for treatment of chronic wounds. The growth factor is delivered in a topical aqueous-based sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboxymethylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboxymethylcellulose</a> gel. It is indicated for noninfected diabetic foot ulcers that extend into the subcutaneous tissue and have an adequate vascular supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A black box warning mentions a concern for malignancy; however, the overall malignancy risk is believed to be low. Malignancy complications of this therapy may reflect usage of the agent in multiple courses of treatment, and possible selective transformation of wounds already at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. A post-marketing study found an increased rate of mortality secondary to malignancy in patients treated with three or more tubes of becaplermin (3.9 versus 0.9 per 1000 person years) compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

The use of systemic beta blockers has been studied in burn patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>], and several case studies have presented the use of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=timolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">timolol</a> in chronic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=timolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Timolol</a> is a topically applied beta blocker with some limited evidence that it promotes keratinocyte migration and epithelialization of chronic wounds, which have been unresponsive to standard wound interventions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268776\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND DRESSINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a suitable dressing is applied to a wound and changed appropriately, the dressing can arguably have a significant impact on the speed of wound healing, wound strength and function of the repaired skin, and cosmetic appearance of the resulting scar. No single dressing is perfect for all wounds; rather, a clinician should evaluate individual wounds and choose the best dressing on a case-by-case basis. Examples of differing types of wounds and potential dressings are given in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60931 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101893 \">table 3</a>). In addition, wounds must be continually monitored as their characteristics and dressing requirements change over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>There is little clinical evidence to aid in the choice between the different types of wound dressings. Consensus opinion supports the following general principles for chronic wound management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], but similar principles may be used for acute wound management: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrogels for the debridement stage </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-adherent and moisture-retentive dressings for the granulation stage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-adherent dressings for the epithelialization stage</p><p/><p>For acute and chronic wound dressing selection, the degree of <span class=\"nowrap\">drainage/moisture</span> balance should guide the clinician. For all intents and purposes, dressings are best suited to manage the moisture level in and around the wound. Although some may have additional benefits in terms of local antimicrobial effects, reduced pain on change, odor control, and anti-inflammatory or mild debridement ability, these are secondary benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Dressings are typically changed once a day or every other day to avoid disturbing the wound healing environment. Because some dressings may impede some aspects of wound healing, they should be used with caution. As examples, alginate dressings with high calcium content may impede epithelialization by triggering premature terminal differentiation of keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], and highly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-containing-dressings-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver-containing dressings</a> are potentially cytotoxic and should not be used in the absence of significant infection.

(See <a href=\"#H456665430\" class=\"local\">'Common dressings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456664428\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of moisture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For much of the history of medicine, it was believed that wounds should not be occluded but left exposed to the air. However, an important study in a pig model showed that moist wounds healed more rapidly compared with wounds that dried out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Similar results have been obtained in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>]. </p><p>Occluded wounds heal up to 40 percent more rapidly than non-occluded wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. This is thought to be due, in part, to easier migration of epidermal cells in the moist environment created by the dressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Another mechanism for improved wound healing may be the exposure of the wound to its own fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Acute wound fluid is rich in platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and has a balance of metalloproteases serving a matrix custodial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. These interact with one another and with other cytokines to stimulate healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. On the other hand, the effect of chronic wound fluid on healing may not be beneficial. Chronic wound fluid is very different from acute wound fluid and contains persistently elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines which may inhibit proliferation of fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>]. Excessive periwound edema and induration contributes to the development of chronic wound fluid and should be managed to minimize this effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-healing#H4011539621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound healing&quot;, section on 'Wound healing'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to faster wound healing, wounds treated with occlusive dressings are associated with less prominent scar formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. One study of porcine skin found an acceleration in the inflammatory and proliferative phases of healing when wounds were covered with an occlusive dressing as opposed to dry gauze [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. This &quot;acceleration&quot; through the wound phases may prevent the development of a chronic wound state which is typically arrested in the inflammatory phase of healing. Wounds that have a greater amount of inflammation tend to result in more significant scars, and thus the decreased inflammation and proliferation seen with wound occlusion may also decrease the appearance of the scar.</p><p>An ideal dressing is one that has the following characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60931 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absorbs excessive wound fluid while maintaining a moist environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protects the wound from further mechanical or caustic damage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevents bacterial invasion or proliferation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conforms to the wound shape and eliminates dead space</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debrides necrotic tissue </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not macerate the surrounding viable tissue </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achieves hemostasis and minimizes edema through compression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not shed fibers or compounds that could cause a foreign body or hypersensitivity reaction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eliminates pain during and between dressing changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizes dressing changes </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is inexpensive, readily available, and has a long shelf life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is transparent in order to monitor wound appearance without disrupting dressing</p><p/><p>In most cases, a dressing with all of these characteristics is not available, and a clinician must decide which of these is most important in the case of a particular wound. The moisture content of a wound bed must be kept in balance for both acute and chronic wounds. The area should be moist enough to promote healing, but excess exudate must be absorbed away from the wound to prevent maceration of the healthy tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456665430\"><span class=\"h2\">Common dressings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although dressings can be categorized based upon many characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60931 \">table 2</a>), it is most useful to classify dressings by their water-retaining abilities because the primary goal of a dressing is the maintenance of moisture in the wound environment. As such, dressings are classified as open, semi-open or semi-occlusive.</p><p>Open dressings include, primarily, gauze, which is typically moistened with saline before placing it into the wound. Gauze bandages are available in multiple sizes, including 2 x 2 inch and 4 x 4 inch square dressings and in 3 or 4 inch rolls (eg, Kerlix). Thicker absorbent pads (eg, ABD pads) are used to cover the gauze dressings. For managing large wounds, self-adhesive straps (Montgomery straps) can be used to hold a bulky dressing in place. As discussed above, dried gauze dressings are discouraged. Wet-to-moist gauze dressings are useful for packing large soft-tissue defects until wound closure or coverage can be performed. Gauze dressings are inexpensive but often require frequent dressing changes.</p><p>Semi-open dressings typically consist of fine mesh gauze impregnated with petroleum, paraffin wax, or other ointment, and have product names such as Xeroform, Adaptic, Jelonet, and Sofra Tulle. This initial layer is covered by a secondary dressing of absorbent gauze and padding, then finally a third layer of tape or other method of adhesive. Benefits of semi-open dressings include their minimum expense and their ease of application. The main disadvantage of this type of dressing is that it<strong> </strong>does not maintain a moisture-rich environment or provide good exudate control. Fluid is permitted to seep through the first layer and is collected in the second layer, allowing for both desiccation of the wound bed and maceration of the surrounding tissue in contact with the secondary layer. Other disadvantages include the bulk of the dressing, its awkwardness when applied to certain areas, and the need for frequent changing. </p><p>Semi-occlusive dressings come in a wide variety of occlusive properties, absorptive capacities, conformability, and bacteriostatic activity. Semi-occlusive dressings include films, foams, alginates, hydrocolloids, and hydrogels, and are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456664407\"><span class=\"h3\">Films</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymer films are transparent sheets of synthetic self-adhesive dressing that are permeable to gases such as water vapor and oxygen but impermeable to larger molecules including proteins and bacteria. This property enables insensible water loss to evaporate, traps wound fluid enzymes within the dressing, and prevents bacterial invasion. These dressings are sometimes known as synthetic adhesive moisture-vapor-permeable dressings, and include Tegaderm, Cutifilm, Blisterfilm, and Bioclusive. Transparent film dressings were found to provide the fastest healing rates, lowest infection rates, and to be the most cost-effective method for dressing split-thickness skin graft donor sites in a review of 33 published studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. </p><p>Advantages of these dressings include their ability to maintain moisture, encourage rapid re-epithelization, and their transparency and self-adhesive properties. Disadvantages of film dressings include limited absorptive capacity, and they are not appropriate for moderately to heavily exudative wounds. If they are allowed to remain in place over a wound with heavy exudates, the surrounding skin is likely to become macerated. In addition, if the wound dries out, film dressings may adhere to the wound and be painful and damaging to remove. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456664400\"><span class=\"h3\">Foams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foam dressings can be thought of as film dressings with the addition of absorbency. They consist of two layers, a hydrophilic silicone or polyurethane-based foam that lies against the wound surface, and a hydrophobic, gas permeable backing to prevent leakage and bacterial contamination. Some foams require a secondary adhesive dressing. Foams are marketed under names such as Allevyn, Adhesive, Lyofoam, and Spyrosorb. </p><p>Advantages of foams include their high absorptive capacity and the fact that they conform to the shape of the wound and can be used to pack cavities. Disadvantages of foams include the opacity of the dressings and the fact that they may need to be changed each day. Foam dressings may not be appropriate on minimally exudative wounds, as they may cause desiccation. </p><p>One small trial compared foams to films as dressings for skin tears in institutionalized adults and found that more complete healing occurred in the group using foams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456664393\"><span class=\"h3\">Alginates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natural complex polysaccharides from various types of algae form the basis of alginate dressings. Their activity as dressings is unique because they are insoluble in water, but in the sodium-rich wound fluid environment these complexes exchange calcium ions for sodium ions and form an amorphous gel that packs and covers the wound. Alginates come in various forms including ribbons, beads, and pads. Their absorptive capacity ranges depending upon the type of polysaccharide used. In general, these dressings are more appropriate for moderately to heavily exudative wounds.</p><p>Advantages of alginates include augmentation of hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>], they can be used for wound packing, most can be washed away with normal saline in order to minimize pain during dressing changes, and they can stay in place for several days. Disadvantages of alginates are that they require a secondary dressing that must be removed in order to monitor the wound, they can be too drying on a minimally exudative wound, and they have an unpleasant odor.</p><p>In a trial of 77 patients, patients with diabetic foot wounds were randomly assigned to alginate or petroleum gauze dressings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Patients treated with alginates were found to have significantly superior granulation tissue coverage at four weeks of treatment, significantly less pain, and fewer dressing changes than the petroleum gauze group. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456664386\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrocolloids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrocolloid dressings usually consist of a gel or foam on a carrier of self-adhesive polyurethane film. The colloid composition of this dressing traps exudate and creates a moist environment. Bacteria and debris are also trapped, and washed away with dressing changes in a gentle, painless form of mechanical debridement. Another advantage of hydrocolloids is the ability to use them for packing wounds. Disadvantages include malodor and the potential need for daily dressing changes, and allergic contact dermatitis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Hydrocolloid products include DuoDERM, Tegasorb, J and J Ulcer Dressing, and Comfeel.</p><p>Cadexomer iodine is a type of hydrocolloid in which iodine is dispersed and slowly released after it comes in contact with wound fluid. The concentration of iodine released is low and does not cause tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. A multi-center trial found that over a 12-week period, Cadexomer iodine paste was more cost-effective than non-iodinated hydrocolloid dressing or paraffin gauze dressing in patients with exudating venous ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. A systematic review found some evidence that topical application of Cadexomer iodine enhanced venous ulcer healing rates compared with standard care (with and without compression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The treatment regimen was complex and it is unclear if the results are generalizable to most clinical settings. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism has been documented with use of Cadexomer iodine for leg ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H369372661\" class=\"local\">'Antiseptics and antimicrobial agents'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456664379\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrogels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrogels are a matrix of various types of synthetic polymers with &gt;95 percent water formed into sheets, gels, or foams that are usually sandwiched between two sheets of removable film. The inner layer is placed against the wound, and the outer layer can be removed to make the dressing permeable to fluid. Sometimes a secondary adhesive dressing is needed. These unique matrices can absorb or donate water depending upon the hydration state of the tissue that surrounds them. Hydrogel products include Intrasite Gel, Vigilon, Carrington Gel, and Elastogel.</p><p>Hydrogels are most useful for dry wounds. They initially lower the temperature of the wound environment they cover, which provides cooling pain relief for some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. As a disadvantage, although there have been no reports of increased wound infection, hydrogels have been found to selectively permit gram-negative bacteria to proliferate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456665792\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydroactive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydroactive, the most recently developed synthetic dressing, is a polyurethane matrix that combines the properties of a gel and a foam. Hydroactive selectively absorbs excess water while leaving growth factors and other proteins behind [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. </p><p>A randomized trial compared hydroactive dressings with two different hydrocolloids and found the hydroactive dressing to be equally effective at promoting ulcer healing and alleviating ulcer-associated pain after 12 weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Another study found hydroactive dressings combined with enzymatic debridement to be more cost-efficient than gauze alone in dressing pressure ulcers and venous stasis ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456663840\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND PACKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds with large soft-tissue defects may have an area of dead space between the surface of intact healthy skin and the wound base. These wounds are described as tunneled or undermined. Undermining is defined as extension of the wound under intact skin edges such that the wound measures larger at its base than is appreciated at the skin surface. </p><p>When describing and documenting undermined wounds, it is important to accurately measure the depth of undermining in centimeters and location of undermining using clock formation as a guide (12:00, 6:00, etc.). The presence of necrotic tissue indicates the need for surgical debridement to decrease bacterial burden and prevent sequelae of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Although there have been no specific trials comparing packed versus unpacked wounds, wound packing is considered standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Traditional gauze dressings are often used to pack wounds associated with significant dead space or undermining to aid in continuing debridement of devitalized tissue from the wound bed. The gauze is moistened with normal saline or tap water and placed into the wound and covered with dry layers of gauze. As the moistened gauze dries, it adheres to surface tissues, which are then removed when the dressing is changed. Dressing changes should be frequent enough that the gauze does not dry out completely, which can be two to three times daily. A disadvantage of gauze dressings is that they can also remove developing granulation tissue, resulting in reinjury. Thus, these dressings are discontinued when the necrotic tissue has been removed and granulation is occurring. An alternative to gauze dressing for managing wounds with significant dead space is negative pressure wound therapy. (See <a href=\"#H55268832\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Many of the materials that are used as topical dressings for wounds (foams, alginates, hydrogels) can be molded into the shape of the wound and are useful for wound packing. As with their use in dressing wounds, there is little consensus over what constitutes the best material for wound packing. (See <a href=\"#H55268776\" class=\"local\">'Wound dressings'</a> above.) </p><p>Wound dressing changes associated with large defects can be managed without repeated applications of tape to the skin by using Montgomery straps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69031\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69031 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268797\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND CLOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary closure refers to the direct apposition of skin edges of acute surgical or traumatic wounds after appropriate wound preparation with sutures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staples (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53921 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62583 \">figure 2</a>).

In other words, the wound is purposefully left open for a period of time, and then the edges are directly apposed with sutures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staples. Although delayed, this still represents primary closure as the skin edges are brought into direct apposition by external means. Delayed closure in abdominal wounds, chest wounds, and surgical wounds without evidence of infection is widely accepted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53921 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. However, a chronic wound should never be closed primarily. In contrast, delayed closure or coverage of chronic wounds is accepted. </p><p>Another option still is healing by secondary intention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53921 \">figure 1</a>). This is where a wound is purposefully left open and fills in with granulation tissue and eventually epithelization over a period of time. At no point are the skin edges brought together by external means. The process of healing by secondary intention might be assisted by the use of negative pressure wound therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268832\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative pressure wound therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negative pressure wound therapy enhances wound healing by reducing edema surrounding the wound, stimulating circulation, and increasing the rate of granulation tissue formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/121-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-124</a>]. The technique involves the application of a controlled subatmospheric pressure to a wound covered with a foam dressing. Negative pressure wound therapy is useful to manage large defects until closure can be performed.

Skin grafts are used for wound closure, to prevent fluid and electrolyte loss, and reduce bacterial burden and infection. Skin transplanted from one location to another on the same individual is termed an autogenous graft or autograft. </p><p>Skin grafts are classified as either split-thickness or full-thickness, depending upon the amount of dermis included in the graft. A partial or split-thickness skin graft contains a variable thickness of dermis, while a full-thickness skin graft contains the entire dermis. The characteristics of normal skin are maintained with a thicker dermal component. However, thicker grafts require a more robust wound bed due to the greater amount of tissue that needs to be revascularized. The choice between full- and split-thickness skin grafting depends upon the condition of the wound, location, size, and need for cosmesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268853\"><span class=\"h3\">Full-thickness skin grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Full-thickness grafts contain the epidermis and dermis, and thus retain more of the characteristics of normal skin, including color, texture, and thickness, when compared with split-thickness grafts. Full-thickness skin grafts are limited to relatively small, uncontaminated, well-vascularized wounds. The skin used for full-thickness skin grafts is obtained from areas of redundant and pliable skin such as the groin, lateral thigh, lower abdomen, or lateral chest. Donor sites are usually closed primarily. The main disadvantages of full-thickness grafts include limited availability of donor skin and the potential for fluid accumulation beneath the graft. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55268860\"><span class=\"h3\">Split-thickness skin grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Split-thickness skin grafts are commonly used tissue for wound coverage. A split-thickness skin graft includes the epidermis and a variable amount of dermis ranging between 0.008 to 0.012 inches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77019\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77019 \">picture 3</a>). Split-thickness skin grafts are further categorized as thin (0.005 to 0.012 inches), intermediate (0.012 to 0.018 inches), or thick (0.018 to 0.030 inches) based upon the thickness of graft harvested.</p><p>Compared with full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness skin grafts tolerate a less-than-ideal wound bed and have a broader range of applications. They can be used to resurface large wounds, line cavities, resurface mucosal deficits, close donor sites of flaps, and resurface muscle flaps. They also are used to achieve temporary closure of wounds created by the removal of lesions that require pathologic examination prior to definitive reconstruction. Split-thickness skin grafts have been used successfully in treating large chronic wounds, including those on the leg and sole of the foot, provided the area can be protected against chronic vertical and shear stresses. </p><p>Split-thickness skin grafts can be meshed to provide coverage of a greater surface area at the recipient site, with expansion ratios generally ranging from 1:1 to 6:1. Split-thickness skin graft donor sites heal spontaneously with cells supplied by the remaining epidermal appendages. Donor sites can be re-harvested once healing is complete. </p><p>Split-thickness grafts have disadvantages that need to be considered. Split-thickness grafts are more fragile, especially when placed over areas with little underlying soft tissue bulk for support. They contract more during healing, do not grow with the individual, and tend to be smoother and shinier than normal skin because of the absence of skin appendages in the graft. They also tend to be abnormally pigmented, either pale or white, or alternatively, hyperpigmented, particularly in darker-skinned individuals. For these reasons, split-thickness skin grafts are more widely used for control of infection and prevention of <span class=\"nowrap\">fluid/electrolyte</span> loss rather than cosmesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/129,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,131</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452797903\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic (cell-based dressings)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic cell-based dressings are composed of a live-cell construct that contains at least one layer<sup> </sup>of live allogenic cells. </p><p>Cell-based dressings can be used when traditional dressings have failed or are deemed inappropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. One study suggested that advanced biologics should be used when chronic wounds fail to heal at an appropriate rate of closure, (ie, 55 percent reduction in wound area within four weeks of treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Cell-based dressings<sup> </sup>are ideal for the treatment of chronic ulcers because additional<sup> </sup>cells and growth factors are added to a deficient wound-healing environment.<sup> </sup>Accelerated wound healing reduces the risk of wound infection. </p><p>Cell-based therapies may use epidermal and dermal elements. Other therapies focus on dermal elements such as collagen and fibroblasts, which prevent wound contraction and provide greater stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. Apligraf combined with compression therapy has been found to improve healing of venous stasis ulcers compared with compression therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. Clinical rejection has not been reported.

In one study of 208 patients with noninfected neuropathic ulcers, weekly application of Graftskin for four weeks improved the rate of complete wound healing compared with usual care (56 versus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

Some of these include AlloDerm, which is made of decellularized allogenic dermal component, and Integra, which is a bovine collagen-based dermal matrix.

Endothelial progenitor cells play an important role in wound healing because they participate in the formation of new blood vessels in areas of hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. Although hyperoxia induced by HBOT effectively improves endothelial progenitor cells' mobilization, therapy is not targeted to the wound site. Serious adverse events can be associated with HBOT including seizures and pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of action'</a>.)</p><p>When indicated, HBOT is accomplished in a specialized chamber that allows for patient monitoring. Chamber pressure is typically maintained between 2.5 and 3.0 atmospheres of pressured oxygen or air. Therapy for nonhealing wounds generally consists of daily sessions of 1.5 to 2 hours for 20 to 40 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].

Systematic reviews have concluded that, although hyperbaric oxygen may benefit some types of wounds (eg, diabetic ulcers), there is insufficient evidence to support routine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/157,158\" class=\"abstract_t\">157,158</a>]. Furthermore, although a number of series and randomized trials of various sizes and quality have suggested its utility, later works have suggested that HBOT may not have significant benefit in treatment of diabetic foot ulcer healing and limb salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-of-chronic-wounds#H450979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment of chronic wounds&quot;, section on 'Hyperbaric oxygen therapy'</a>.)</p><p>HBOT may be of value in patients with extensive soft tissue injury. A systematic review identified three trials evaluating the use of HBOT in acute surgical and traumatic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. Due to the small numbers of included patients and heterogeneity of patients treated, a metaanalysis could not be performed. The authors also noted a potential risk for bias. In one of the trials, 36 patients with crush injuries were randomly assigned to a 90 minute twice daily HBOT or sham treatments for a total of six days postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-of-wound-management/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. The group treated with hyperbaric oxygen had significantly more complete healing (17 versus 10 patients) and required fewer skin flaps, grafts, vascular surgery, or amputation (1 versus 6 patients).
