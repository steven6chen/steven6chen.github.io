The term &quot;congenital&quot; means a condition a person is born with.</p><p>Syphilis is an infection you can catch during sex that causes red sores, usually on the penis or around the vagina or anus. Since the sores don't hurt, many people don't get treatment for syphilis. If a woman has syphilis when she is pregnant, the infection can spread to the baby through the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste.) Babies can also become infected during birth.</p><p>Congenital syphilis is very serious. It can cause a baby to be born too early or to die before birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333165\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of congenital syphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most newborns with congenital syphilis do not have symptoms. When they do, symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A big liver &ndash; The liver is an organ in the upper right side of the belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A runny nose &ndash; This is worse than the runny nose from a common cold. Babies with congenital syphilis have mucus that is white and might be bloody. The mucus contains the germs that cause syphilis. You can get syphilis if you touch it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small red or pink spots on the skin &ndash; These are mostly on the back, the bottom, the back of the upper legs, and the soles of the feet. The skin spots contain the germs that cause syphilis. You can get syphilis if you touch them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen lymph nodes &ndash; Lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs found all over the body under the skin. They make and store cells that fight infections.</p><p/><p>Symptoms in older babies and children include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;saddle nose&quot; &ndash; This means the upper bridge of the nose is flattened</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A forehead that sticks out more than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of the clear tissue that covers the colored part of the eye, called the &quot;cornea&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teeth that have notches and gaps between them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scars around the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red, open sores on the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the bones and joints, mostly in the legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble thinking and solving problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333180\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for congenital syphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor might take a sample of the discharge from the baby's nose or from a sore on the baby's body. Then another doctor will look at this fluid under a microscope to check for signs of the infection.</p><p>Other tests might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (also known as a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a thin needle in the lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will do lab tests on the spinal fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333195\"><span class=\"h1\">How is congenital syphilis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital syphilis is treated with a medicine called penicillin. The medicine can be given as an injection (shot) or through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333210\"><span class=\"h1\">Can congenital syphilis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventing and treating syphilis in adults can prevent congenital syphilis. Adults can lower their chances of getting syphilis by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a latex condom every time they have sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding sex when either person has any symptoms that could be caused by an infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex</p><p/><p>Another way to prevent congenital syphilis is to make sure that women who get syphilis are treated. Getting treated before getting pregnant is best, but women can still get treated during pregnancy. It is important to get tested after treatment to make sure that the treatment worked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25333236\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syphilis (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
