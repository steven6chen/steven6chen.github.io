The top of the thigh (femur) bone (ball) fits into a part of the pelvis called the acetabulum (socket), allowing the joint to move smoothly in multiple directions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70663\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70663 \">figure 1</a>). Total hip replacement is a surgical procedure that replaces the hip joint with artificial parts (called prostheses). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common cause of hip joint deterioration is osteoarthritis; other possible causes include inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis), hip disorders of infancy and childhood, osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis), and trauma.</p><p>This article will discuss total hip replacement surgery. A review of other treatment options for arthritis is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR HIP REPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total hip replacement is only considered when you have tried and failed more conservative treatments, yet you continue to have significant pain, stiffness, or problems with the function of your hip.</p><p>Total hip replacement may be performed on adults with a deteriorated hip. However, the replacement parts can break down over time, and healthcare providers generally recommend delaying hip replacement until it is absolutely necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVES TO HIP REPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While total hip replacement can be helpful under the right circumstances, you should only consider it after a discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives with a healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsurgical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsurgical treatment methods are initially recommended for people with hip problems due to osteoarthritis or other conditions. Nonsurgical treatments for people with osteoarthritis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss or maintenance of a healthy weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of an assistive device (such as a cane or walker)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-relieving medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid (steroid) injection into the painful joint</p><p/><p>People with inflammatory arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis) may benefit from a treatment regimen of antirheumatic or other medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few surgical alternatives to total hip replacement. Surgical alternatives to hip replacement, such as hip fusion or osteotomy, may be considered in people who are very young or in whom a hip replacement may not be durable enough to last for many years <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may not withstand an active lifestyle. Total hip resurfacing is another option for younger patients. The best surgical procedure depends upon the reasons for which the joint deteriorated. More information about surgical alternatives to hip replacement is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total hip replacement is performed in an operating room after you are given general or regional (epidural or spinal) anesthesia. The surgical approach used will be determined by your surgeon and is typically a single incision along the posterior (rear), lateral (side), or anterior (front) aspect of the hip. Less invasive hip replacement surgery techniques, which use smaller incisions and specialized instruments, are often used.</p><p>The type of prosthesis and the material used for the &quot;bearing surface&quot; (outer layer) depends upon the needs of the particular patient and the surgeon performing the procedure. There are a variety of types of prosthetic bearing surfaces, including metal-on-plastic, ceramic-on-plastic, metal-on-metal, and ceramic-on-ceramic. An example of one type of prosthesis is shown here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65030 \">figure 2</a>). Each surface has unique advantages and disadvantages, and your surgeon can discuss which is appropriate for you. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">AFTER SURGERY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, you will be given pain medication through your IV or by mouth. You will also be given an antibiotic to prevent infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-prosthetic-joint-and-other-types-of-orthopedic-hardware-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of prosthetic joint and other types of orthopedic hardware infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most people are also given a medication to help prevent blood clots in the legs. Compression boots (devices that are worn around the legs and that inflate periodically) are often worn to prevent blood clots. Compression stockings may also be recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical therapy (PT) is an important part of the recovery process. Most people are able to stand and even walk, with the help of a physical therapist, within the first 24 hours.</p><p>Your length of stay in the hospital will depend upon a number of factors, including pain control, demonstration of safe mobility, and medical stability. After your surgery, you will work with a physical therapist to develop an exercise and rehabilitation program. In some cases, the surgery can be done as an &quot;outpatient&quot; procedure, meaning you can go home the same day. In some situations, it isn't safe to go home immediately, and the person will need to stay in the hospital or go to a nursing facility for rehabilitation.</p><p>You will continue your therapy until you are able to independently perform daily activities. The rehabilitation program generally includes exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles surrounding the hip joint, as well as training in activities of daily life (eg, stair climbing, bending, walking). The goal of the rehabilitation is to regain strength and motion.</p><p>After several weeks of recovery, you will be encouraged to return to an active lifestyle. Most people can resume their normal activities within weeks to months. With newer surgical techniques, recovery time may be reduced. While high-impact sports such as running and contact sports are not usually recommended after hip replacement, you can typically participate in activities like walking, cycling, and swimming.</p><p>With modern implants and bearing surfaces, it is now anticipated that most hip replacements will last well beyond the previous expectation of 10 to 15 years. Most patients are very satisfied with their outcome, reporting minimal to no pain and significantly improved function and quality of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious complications after hip replacement surgery are not common and can be minimized by choosing a clinician who is experienced and performs the procedure frequently. In addition, choosing a hospital that specializes in caring for joint replacement patients before, during, and after surgery can also minimize complications.</p><p>Complications can occur during surgery, in the immediate postoperative period, or many years after surgery. It is important to understand these potential risks before deciding to undergo hip replacement. For most patients, the benefits of reduced pain and improved function outweigh the small risk of complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications during surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very rarely, complications can occur during the actual hip replacement procedure. These include fractures (typically of the femur) and injury to the surrounding nerves or blood vessels. Most of these complications can be treated during the course of the surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood clots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who undergo hip replacement are at increased risk for developing blood clots after surgery. With appropriate preventive treatments, only about 1 percent of people will develop a blood clot. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-embolism-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pulmonary embolism (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection following hip replacement is uncommon (between 0.4 and 1.5 percent of patients). Prevention protocols that include preoperative weight reduction, smoking cessation, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) screening, skin <span class=\"nowrap\">preparation/washing,</span> and routine antibiotics (during the first 24 hours only) can all help to minimize the risk of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Joint infection (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dislocation of the artificial hip joint can occur if the ball becomes dislodged from the socket. Dislocation occurs in less than 2 percent of patients. In most cases, an orthopedic surgeon can move the joint back into place while the patient is sedated.</p><p>To minimize the risk of dislocation, some patients may be given specific precautions related to the motion of the hip. The need for precautions depends upon how your surgery is performed and should be discussed with your surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Loosening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loosening of the joint implant is most often caused by wear of the prosthetic components. It is the most common long-term problem associated with total hip replacement, although the number of people who develop loosening is decreasing as prosthetic materials and surfaces are improved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Breakage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breakage of the implant itself can occur as a result of wear and tear of the prosthesis, often over the course of years. Older implants are more likely to break, while newer prostheses are stronger and more durable. This is a rare occurrence, with less than 0.5 percent of people experiencing breakage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Change in leg length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before, during, and after hip replacement surgery, a surgeon carefully measures the length of your legs in an attempt to make them equal length. However, in rare cases, the procedure results in one leg being slightly longer than the other. Some people with a significant difference in leg length find that wearing a lift in one shoe is helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint stiffening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint stiffening caused by extra bone formation, also called heterotopic ossification, is a process in which some soft tissues around the hip harden into bone. People with this problem may experience hip stiffness or may feel no discomfort at all. If you are at risk for joint stiffening, your healthcare provider may recommend a preventive treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total hip replacement is a very effective surgical procedure that involves replacing the damaged &quot;ball and socket&quot; parts of the hip with replacement (prosthetic) parts, with the goal of relieving pain and improving function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients require total hip replacement due to pain caused by arthritis.
