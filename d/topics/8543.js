However, symptoms are unlikely to occur in most healthy children until serum potassium is below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>The etiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric hypokalemia are reviewed here.

In one study of 667 children cared for in a single-center pediatric intensive care unit in the United States during the calendar year 2006, 40 percent of the patients had a serum potassium level below 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This included patients with severe hypokalemia, defined as potassium level less than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (4 percent); moderate hypokalemia, defined as potassium level 2.5 to less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (12 percent); and mild hypokalemia, defined as potassium level from 3 to less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (24 percent). Hypokalemia was associated with diagnoses of cardiac disease, renal failure, or shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In developing countries, severe hypokalemia (potassium level &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> is often observed in children with diarrhea and severe acute malnutrition, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1662454214\"><span class=\"h1\">POTASSIUM BALANCE AND LEVELS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7910133\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potassium is primarily an intracellular cation with cells containing approximately 98 percent of total body potassium. Hypokalemia is defined as serum level below the normal value, which is usually defined as 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7910153\"><span class=\"h2\">Homeostatic mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homeostatic mechanisms regulate potassium balance in order to maintain high intracellular levels required for cellular functions (metabolism and growth), and low extracellular concentration to preserve the steep concentration gradient across the cell membrane needed for nerve excitation and muscle contraction. In children, positive potassium balance is needed for growth, whereas in adults, homeostasis is directed towards a zero potassium balance.</p><p>After a bolus of potassium intake, normal physiologic processes preserve the intra- and extracellular balance via intracellular potassium movement, which is regulated by cell membrane Na-K-ATPase (mediated by insulin, and alpha- and beta-2 adrenergic agonists), and urinary potassium excretion (primarily mediated by aldosterone). Although normal serum and plasma potassium concentrations in children and adolescents are similar to levels in adults, infants have a higher normal range of potassium because of their reduced urinary potassium excretion, which is caused by their relatively increased aldosterone insensitivity and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501 \">table 1</a>).

Understanding the underlying physiology is helpful in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of children with hypokalemia.</p><p>Pediatric hypokalemia is due to one or a combination of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased potassium intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intracellular movement of potassium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive loss of potassium via the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, or skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1662454255\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the following sections, the causes of pediatric hypokalemia are classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98036 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1662454269\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased intake alone is unlikely to cause hypokalemia in healthy children.

Increased activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alterations in other potassium transport pathways can result in transient hypokalemia due to increased potassium entry into cells from the extracellular space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1662454290\"><span class=\"h3\">Alkalosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either respiratory or metabolic alkalosis can be associated with hypokalemia. In this setting, intracellular potassium movement is promoted to maintain electroneutrality as hydrogen ions exit the cell in response to the increase in extracellular pH. In general, serum potassium concentration falls by less than 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for every 0.1 unit rise in pH.</p><p>In children with metabolic alkalosis, there is also an increased loss of urinary potassium. This is due to a rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration, resulting in a filtered bicarbonate load above its reabsorptive threshold, which leads to increased distal delivery of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. At the distal tubule, sodium is exchanged for potassium, causing the increased loss in urinary potassium.

In particular, insulin administration in children with diabetic ketoacidosis results in a fall in serum potassium due to the increased insulin-mediated intracellular movement of potassium. One small study also reported that insulin increased renal potassium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemia-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Normal serum potassium concentrations in children and adolescents are similar to levels in adults. However, infants have a higher normal range of potassium because of their reduced urinary potassium excretion, caused by their relatively increased aldosterone insensitivity and decreased glomerular filtration rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86501 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric hypokalemia is caused by derangements of the normal hemostatic mechanisms that regulate potassium balance, and include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98036 \">table 2</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased dietary potassium intake is unlikely to cause hypokalemia in healthy children. However, prolonged decreased intake can contribute to potassium depletion caused by other disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intracellular potassium uptake results in transient hypokalemia. Increased potassium entry into the cells is promoted by the following conditions: alkalosis, increased insulin activity (eg, exogenous insulin administration) and beta-adrenergic activity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> administration), and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. (See <a href=\"#H1662454283\" class=\"local\">'Increased intracellular uptake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased gastrointestinal loss is the most common cause of pediatric hypokalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased urinary losses is usually due to either increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron in exchange for potassium (eg, diuretic therapy, genetic tubular disorders [Bartter and Gitelman syndromes], and osmotic diuresis) or increased mineralocorticoid activity (eg, hyperaldosteronism due to hypovolemia). (See <a href=\"#H1662454342\" class=\"local\">'Increased urinary losses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations vary depending on the severity and acuity of hypokalemia. Symptoms generally do not become manifest until the serum potassium is below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> unless there is a rapid significant fall in serum potassium. Clinical findings include muscle weakness and paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and polyuria due to impaired urinary concentration. (See <a href=\"#H7909752\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hypokalemia is made by the detection of a serum or plasma potassium level that is below the normal range of 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. In many instances, the diagnosis is made incidentally when serum or plasma electrolytes are obtained during an evaluation for another condition, especially in children with levels between 3 and 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> whereas levels below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> are more often associated with clinical signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H7909840\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After acute management of symptomatic severe hypokalemia, further evaluation focuses on determining the etiology, as subsequent care is based on the underlying cause of hypokalemia. The assessment includes a focused history and physical examination. In most cases, the history is sufficient to determine the underlying cause. However, additional laboratory testing may be needed in patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98041\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef98041 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1662454384\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation to determine underlying etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acuity and degree of the hypokalemia influence the clinical approach to therapy. The goals of therapy are to prevent or treat life-threatening complications (arrhythmias, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, and diaphragmatic weakness) associated with severe hypokalemia, replace the potassium deficit, and correct the underlying cause. (See <a href=\"#H1662454413\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic patients with hypokalemia (arrhythmias, marked muscle weakness, or paralysis), we recommend that potassium supplementation be administered (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In some cases, this requires intravenous (IV) administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a>, particularly in those who are unable to take oral medications. In this setting, an infusion with a potassium concentration of no more than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is given at a rate <strong>not </strong>to exceed 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> of body weight per hour. The goal is to raise the potassium level by 0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. These patients require continuous ECG monitoring to detect changes due to hypokalemia, and also possibly rebound hyperkalemia during replacement therapy. (See <a href=\"#H74338\" class=\"local\">'Our approach based on severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic patients, the need for potassium supplementation is based on the underlying cause and the severity of hypokalemia. If potassium supplementation is needed, we recommend that oral potassium therapy be given (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The formulation of potassium is also dependent on the underlying condition.
