They may be benign or malignant. Malignant germ cell cancers of the ovary include dysgerminomas and nondysgerminomas, which include immature teratomas, embryonal cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumors, primary ovarian (nongestational) choriocarcinomas, polyembryoma, and mixed germ cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), they constitute a rare form of ovarian malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dysgerminomas differ from other malignant OGCTs in several ways: they are more likely to be localized to the ovary at diagnosis (approximately two-thirds of cases are stage IA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 1</a>)), bilateral ovarian involvement is more common (10 to 15 percent), they are more likely to spread in a predictable fashion, and they are more sensitive to radiation therapy (RT).</p><p>The management of malignant OGCTs will be reviewed here. Pathology and clinical manifestations of these neoplasms, as well as the treatment of benign OGCTs, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965172\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the treatment principles for all types of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (OGCTs) are similar to those that guide the management of the more common epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), with some exceptions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many OGCTs produce tumor products (alpha fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) that can be measured in the serum. The presence of these markers provides a highly sensitive and specific indicator of the presence of certain histologic components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55817 \">table 2</a>). Testing for serum tumor markers prior to definitive treatment can provide a diagnostic clue to the presence of an OGCT. In a child, teen, or young woman, the tumor marker results may help with surgical planning, resulting in the preservation of fertility potential. Furthermore, serial assay of these tumor markers is useful for monitoring the response to chemotherapy and for subsequent posttreatment follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is required for diagnosis, staging, and treatment. As with EOC, adults with OGCTs should undergo a thorough exploration of the abdomen with complete surgical staging (for apparent early-stage disease) and optimal cytoreduction (for metastatic disease) when safe and feasible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most OGCTs are stage I (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 1</a>) at initial presentation, and most patients can be safely treated with fertility-preserving surgery rather than total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. (See <a href=\"#H467455\" class=\"local\">'Fertility-sparing surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant OGCTs occurring in adult women are highly sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, and treatment can be curative. This fact, coupled with the poor outcomes from surgery alone (even for stage I disease), has led to routine administration of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy to most adult patients except those with stage IA or IB dysgerminoma and stage IA, grade 1 immature teratoma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL STAGING AND PRIMARY CYTOREDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical management of OGCTs is both diagnostic and therapeutic. In general, the scope of the operative procedure depends upon the surgical findings and the patient's desire to maintain fertility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> avoid exogenous estrogen supplementation.</p><p>Areas of controversy include: whether hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are required for optimal outcomes in patients with apparent early-stage disease, the extent of cytoreductive surgery in patients with advanced-stage disease, and the role of minimally invasive surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management#H541926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;, section on 'Role of laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965526\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging system used for OGCTs is identical to that used for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 1</a>). Malignant OGCTs spread via the lymphatics, bloodstream, or by peritoneal surface dissemination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965593\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging procedure for adult women with OGCTs is the same as for EOC. This is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management#H10115888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;, section on 'Staging procedure'</a>.)</p><p>The standard staging procedure for ovarian cancer is total extrafascial hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection. However, OGCTs often affect children, adolescents, or young women, and fertility-sparing surgery should be performed when possible. (See <a href=\"#H466456752\" class=\"local\">'Children and adolescents'</a> below and <a href=\"#H467455\" class=\"local\">'Fertility-sparing surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Peritoneal cytology is collected after the incision is made. Staging also includes omentectomy and cytology of the diaphragm. As with other intraabdominal gynecologic malignancies, complete staging includes biopsy of any areas where metastases are suspected. Cytoreduction often is performed when metastases are evident. </p><p>Laparotomy is generally used. Laparoscopic or robot-assisted approaches are not considered prudent by some experts, but some surgeons have reported success with these techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965576\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphadenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to EOC, nodal involvement is more common with malignant OGCTs. Therefore, lymphadenectomy is generally performed as part of the surgical procedure.</p><p>In a large retrospective study, the overall prevalence of lymph node metastasis in OGCTs varied by histology: dysgerminoma (28 percent), mixed germ cell tumors (16 percent), and malignant teratoma (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Importantly, lymph node involvement was an independent predictor of poor survival with a hazard ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.4-5.7). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management#H541926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;, section on 'Role of laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial cytoreduction for advanced disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with advanced tumors, optimal cytoreductive surgery is associated with improved outcomes, particularly for nondysgerminomatous tumors. However, the benefits and risks of aggressive cytoreductive maneuvers for metastatic disease must be carefully weighed for these chemotherapy-sensitive tumors.</p><p>If advanced disease is encountered at initial exploration, cytoreductive surgery should be attempted, following the same principles as established for advanced EOC. As much tumor should be resected as is technically feasible and safe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;, section on 'Cytoreduction'</a>.)</p><p>Due to the rarity of malignant OGCTs, the benefit of cytoreductive surgery is less well-established than with EOC. However, surgical debulking of large tumor masses plays a central role in the upfront treatment of OGCTs. Despite the sensitivity of OGCTs to platinum-based chemotherapy, tumor volume is one of the most important prognostic factors for outcome. In most clinical series, prognosis is worse for women with metastatic or incompletely resected disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79165 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Although randomized trials have not been conducted, there is observational evidence that patients with malignant OGCTs who have optimally debulked disease (ie, all areas of residual disease less than 2 cm) have a higher complete remission rate from chemotherapy and better long-term outcomes than those with bulky unresectable disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an early trial from the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), the likelihood of disease progression after postoperative chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dactinomycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (VAC) was significantly higher in patients who had incompletely as compared with completely resected disease at the time of primary surgery (68 versus 28 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent GOG trial examined the benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> (PVB) chemotherapy followed by restaging laparotomy in 111 women with advanced (stage II to IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 1</a>)) or recurrent malignant OGCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Eighty-nine had initial cytoreductive surgery, which was recommended but not mandated. Patients who had tumors other than dysgerminoma and clinically nonmeasurable disease after initial surgery had a significantly greater chance of remaining progression free than those with measurable disease (65 versus 34 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal debulking may be more critical for nondysgerminoma tumors. This was shown in a case series of 33 patients with malignant OGCTs, 13 of whom had bulky (&gt;10 cm) residual tumor after primary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. All 11 patients with dysgerminoma achieved a complete sustained remission after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP), regardless of the size of the postsurgery residual disease. Four of six patients with bulky nondysgerminomatous OGCTs were complete responders to chemotherapy; three sustained long-term. By contrast, 15 of 16 nonbulky nondysgerminomatous OGCTs achieved a complete response to chemotherapy, which was durable in 14 cases.</p><p/><p>As a result, the majority of women with OGCTs undergo maximal surgical cytoreduction before starting chemotherapy. The central role that upfront surgery plays in OGCTs is in direct contrast to testicular cancer, where surgery is typically reserved for residual masses that remain after chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-surgery-following-chemotherapy-for-advanced-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to surgery following chemotherapy for advanced testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite the importance of upfront surgical debulking, the surgeon should keep in mind the sensitivity of these tumors to cisplatin-based chemotherapy when aggressive resection of metastatic disease is considered, particularly in patients with dysgerminomas. With modern cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy, approximately 80 percent of patients who present with advanced disease will be long-term survivors, even if they have residual disease remaining after cytoreductive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H466456963\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant treatment'</a> below.) </p><p>In rare instances, the extent of metastatic disease or effusions may be so great or comorbidities may be so significant that a primary surgical approach is not warranted. In such cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be administered. However, little information on outcomes exists, and clinical trials are needed to evaluate outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466456963\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We advise most women to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for OGCTs. Exceptions to this include adult patients with stage IA, grade 1 immature teratoma and stage IA and IB dysgerminoma because their outcomes are excellent following surgery alone. Although 15 to 25 percent of such patients will recur, virtually all of these women can be treated with platinum-based chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT) with curative intent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78392 \">table 4</a>). Long-term cure rates are &gt;90 percent. The approach to women with de novo stage IV OGCT, as well as the approach to children with OGCTs, is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H466460365\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of de novo stage IV disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H466456752\" class=\"local\">'Children and adolescents'</a> below.)</p><p>Due to the rarity of these tumors, data on efficacy are limited to single-arm clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>] or retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/8,11,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,15-20</a>], often with small numbers of patients enrolled or evaluated. However, as with testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs), the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy appears to have improved overall survival following surgery when compared with historical controls. These gains in outcome date back to one of the original studies from 1975, which reported that combination chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, actinomycin-D, plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>) resulted in the survival of 15 of 20 women with nondysgerminomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The evolution of chemotherapy to incorporate platinum agents mirrors that of testicular GCTs, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy is now considered the standard of care for patients in whom adjuvant treatment is indicated. Applying the same cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimens to OGCTs has resulted in dramatically improved outcomes; at least 90 percent of women with early-stage OGCTs and up to 80 percent of those with advanced disease are long-term survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056139004\"><span class=\"h2\">Platinum-based therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple platinum-based regimens have been used for OGCTs, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65516 \">table 5</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etoposide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> (see <a href=\"#H466458148\" class=\"local\">'Substitution of cisplatin with carboplatin'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etoposide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (EP). While this regimen has very limited use given preference for BEP, it is an appropriate option for patients who cannot tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>. Based on data from the treatment of testicular GCTs, EP and BEP are likely to have equivalent activity. Although there are no prospective data to inform the optimal number of cycles, three cycles of EP are usually administered for patients deemed to be at a lower risk of recurrence (eg, a &quot;good-risk&quot; cohort). For those with a higher risk of relapse, four cycles are administered.</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, there is no consensus definition for prognostic risk groups.

Long-term survival rates with surgery followed by adjuvant BEP are 95 to 100 percent for early-stage nondysgerminomatous tumors and 75 to 80 percent for those with advanced disease at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

This disparity is illustrated in a combined retrospective study performed by the Pediatric Oncology Group and Children&rsquo;s Cancer Study Group that included 131 girls (mean age, 11.9 years), all of whom underwent surgical resection (if possible for those who presented with advanced-stage disease) followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The main findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite stage at presentation, complete surgical staging was seldom performed. Among the surgical omissions were no nodal sampling (97 percent), no omentectomy (36 percent), and no peritoneal cytology (21 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The six-year overall survival rates were 95, 94, 97, and 93 percent for stages I (n = 41), II (n = 16), III (n = 58), and IV (n = 16), respectively. The six-year event-free survival rates by stage were 95, 88, 97, and 87 percent.</p><p/><p>Although this was a retrospective study, pediatric and adolescent patients appear to have an excellent outcome, likely due to the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy in all patients. However, whether chemotherapy is necessary for all patients is not answered by this study and points to the potential importance of comprehensive surgical staging as a way to help stratify patients at a higher risk of recurrence, for whom adjuvant therapy should be administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544590393\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment after surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although limited data are available, surveillance for girls with stage IA malignant OGCTs appears to be reasonable. In one study, 25 girls with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA malignant OGCTs were enrolled in a study of the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group and underwent surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although 12 patients had persistent disease or experienced recurrence, 11 were successfully treated with chemotherapy at the time of relapse.</p><p>Adjuvant chemotherapy is routinely offered to patients with higher-stage disease. The exception is for patients with metastatic immature teratoma, in whom postoperative chemotherapy has not been shown to decrease relapses, based on a combined data analysis of seven pediatric trials including 98 patients, of whom 90 were treated with surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In general, we advocate for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP) if chemotherapy is indicated. However, limited data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> can be used instead of cisplatin in an attempt to reduce toxicities while preserving efficacy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, 137 children with extracranial GCTs (recurrent stage I disease and all other patients) received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on day 2), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on days 1 through 3), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on day 3) (JEB) every three to four weeks for two courses beyond clinical remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

An international clinical trial seeking to compare cisplatin- with carboplatin-containing regimens in children and adults is under development. Therefore, we reserve carboplatin as a substitute for cisplatin if there are contraindications to the use of cisplatin (eg, renal failure).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OGCTs often occur in women of reproductive age; therefore, these tumors are one of the more common ovarian malignancies diagnosed in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Chemotherapy treatment of OGCTs in pregnant women is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-of-ovarian-cancer-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy of ovarian cancer in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (OGCTs) include dysgerminomas (analogous to the male testicular seminoma) and nondysgerminomatous tumors. Nondysgerminomatous tumors include immature teratomas, embryonal cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumors, primary ovarian (nongestational) choriocarcinomas, polyembryoma, and mixed germ cell tumors. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment principles for all types of malignant OGCTs are generally similar and include surgery for diagnosis and staging, cytoreductive surgery if advanced disease is present, and adjuvant chemotherapy in most cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55704\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55704 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1965172\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OGCTs occur predominantly in children and young women. For these patients, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with preservation of the uterus and the contralateral ovary may be performed if these organs appear normal. Standard surgical staging with total extrafascial hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is generally performed on women who have completed childbearing. (See <a href=\"#H466456752\" class=\"local\">'Children and adolescents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H467455\" class=\"local\">'Fertility-sparing surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most adult women with a newly diagnosed OGCT, we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Our regimen of choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (BEP). Women with stage IA or IB dysgerminoma or stage IA, grade 1 immature teratomas have an excellent prognosis following surgical treatment alone, and therefore, we recommend against administering adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H466456963\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All women should be followed by history and physical exam after the completion of treatment for OGCTs. Serum tumor markers should be followed serially as well. In keeping with the guidelines from the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, we only perform radiographic surveillance within the first two years if tumor markers were not elevated initially. Given the risk for late relapse, dysgerminomas require annual follow-up for at least 10 years. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who relapse and did not receive chemotherapy previously (ie, in the adjuvant setting), we recommend platinum-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). As in the adjuvant setting, our regimen of choice is BEP. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to treatment for women with relapsed disease despite prior treatment with chemotherapy is extrapolated from the approach to men with relapsed or refractory testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-relapsed-and-refractory-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of relapsed and refractory testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pediatric and adolescent girls (see <a href=\"#H466456752\" class=\"local\">'Children and adolescents'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest postoperative surveillance for those with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA OGCTs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the exception of patients with immature teratomas regardless of grade, we suggest adjuvant chemotherapy for those with more advanced disease (stage IB to IV) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For those with immature teratomas regardless of grade, we suggest observation rather than adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>As in adult women, our regimen of choice is BEP.
