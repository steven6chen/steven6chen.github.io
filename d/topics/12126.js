These issues are discussed in depth separately.

When the ovary cannot be salvaged or insufficient viable tissue remains after attempts at conservation, oophorectomy is performed. In postmenopausal patients, no effort is made to preserve the ovary.</p><p>Indications for oophorectomy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign ovarian neoplasms that are not amenable to treatment by a lesser procedure (eg, cystectomy, enucleation, partial oophorectomy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elective or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adnexal (ovarian) torsion with necrosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian malignancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuboovarian abscess unresponsive to antibiotics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive surgery for endometriosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal or other metastatic cancer (eg, breast, lung, melanoma) &ndash; Gastrointestinal cancer often metastasizes to the ovary. In one study, ovarian metastases were encountered in 25 percent of patients with an adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract; the metastases were occult in approximately one-half of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, oophorectomy and concomitant hysterectomy should be considered at the time of resection of the gastrointestinal cancer, especially in women approaching or beyond the menopausal transition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male pseudohermaphrodites, in whom the procedure is termed &ldquo;gonadectomy&rdquo; &ndash; An increased risk of gonadal malignancy occurs in phenotypic females with a Y chromosome in their karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. These individuals should have their gonads removed to avoid the 20 to 30 percent risk of malignant tumors arising in this tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Gonadectomy is delayed until after pubertal development in patients with complete androgen insensitivity, in which it is rare to develop a malignancy before 20 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Dysgerminoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The gonadal streaks can be difficult to see and may lie very close to the external iliac artery or be herniated into the inguinal canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61927\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61927 \">figure 1</a>). Although laparotomy has historically been the standard approach for both surgical ease and safety, this operation can be safely done by experienced individuals using a minimally invasive approach. There is no need to remove the uterus or the fallopian tubes; these organs can be preserved to permit future childbearing using donor oocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ASPIRATION AND FENESTRATION VERSUS CYSTECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration of cyst contents is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended because no tissue is obtained for histopathology, cytology of cyst fluid is not reliable for exclusion of malignancy, there is a high rate of recurrence (11 to 65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and aspiration does not provide better results than simple observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These problems are less common with fenestration (ie, removing a full thickness, square portion of the cyst wall to create a window), but cystectomy is preferable. If the cyst is malignant, spillage of malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity is possible with both aspiration and fenestration.</p><p>Aspiration followed by sclerotherapy via injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, alcohol, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> has been associated with a lower rate (4 to 38 percent) of cyst persistence or recurrence in observational series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/8,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-13</a>]. However, it is not clear that this intervention is more effective than expectant management because the studies were not adequately controlled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Open laparotomy versus laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ovarian surgeries are for benign disease and can be performed laparoscopically. The major advantages to laparoscopy over laparotomy are reductions in recovery time, hospital stay, cost, and adhesion formation, which is particularly important in women in whom fertility is an issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Limited data from randomized trials also showed less febrile morbidity and a lower frequency of urinary tract infection, postoperative pain and postoperative complications with laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gynecologic laparoscopic surgery and non-umbilical entry sites&quot;</a>). Guidelines for preoperative referral to a gynecologic oncologist are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55063 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>A disadvantage of laparoscopic <span class=\"nowrap\">oophorectomy/cystectomy</span> is the potential for spill of cancer cells if the mass is malignant (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Spillage of malignant cells'</a> below). Unfortunately, neither preoperative clinical and sonographic evaluation nor the laparoscopic appearance of the ovary can reliably predict which masses are malignant. However, it is unlikely that an inadvertent laparoscopic procedure for ovarian cancer will be performed if patients are carefully selected. A survey by the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists reported unsuspected ovarian cancer was found in only 0.04 percent of 13,739 cases of laparoscopic ovarian cyst surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Sonographic criteria suggestive of ovarian malignancy are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109384 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>). In general, a thin-walled unilocular simple cyst is likely to be benign, even in postmenopausal women. Two series including approximately 1000 thin-walled unilocular cysts in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women found no malignant tumors under 75 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A separate series of 219 patients with simple cysts up to 10 cm were managed successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, these cysts can usually be managed laparoscopically. An in-depth discussion of the approach to evaluation and management of adnexal masses can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is increasing sentiment to evaluate some complex cysts laparoscopically because most of them are benign. There are no dogmatic recommendations for this group of patients and clinicians must individualize treatment according to their index of suspicion. The concern associated with the use of laparoscopy in this setting is that the prognosis may be worsened by cyst rupture if malignancy is encountered, although this is unproven. Therefore, one must take into account the patient's age, medical condition, clinical examination (eg, fixed mass or mobile), sonographic appearance of the mass, and tumor markers (eg, CA-125) to gauge the likelihood of malignancy when deciding upon the proper operative approach. Laparoscopy should be reserved for those cases in which the risk of malignancy is very low. If a malignancy is encountered, the patient should immediately have the appropriate open surgical procedure for staging and definitive treatment, preferably with the assistance of a gynecologic oncologist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75194 \">table 3</a>). Staging and treatment of ovarian cancer via a laparoscopic approach is still under investigation, but it is becoming more commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another approach is minilaparotomy, which some surgeons consider a minimally invasive procedure. Minilaparotomy has the advantages of a potentially shorter operating time and learning curve than laparoscopy and avoidance of pneumoperitoneum, but without the large incision associated with classical open laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The procedure is performed by placing the patient in a steep Trendelenburg position and making a minimal suprapubic incision (4 to 9 cm) beneath the pubic hair line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The abdominal fascia is opened 2 to 3 cm above the skin incision and the peritoneum is opened manually. Narrow Deaver retractors are used to allow frequent repositioning to optimize exposure of the surgical field. The following criteria should be met if this approach is employed: use of narrow and light instruments; exteriorization of the target organ; combined, unidirectional maneuvering of all the retractors; and prompt hemostasis by electrocoagulating forceps. A comparable approach is the use of minilaparotomy at the time of laparoscopy for the purpose of specimen retrieval. This also has the added advantage of a quick recovery as the majority of the operation is done laparoscopically.</p><p>In summary, laparoscopy is the preferred technique for <span class=\"nowrap\">oophorectomy/cystectomy</span> because it is associated with a smaller scar, faster recovery, lower cost, and lower frequency of postoperative adhesion formation than laparotomy. Situations in which the traditional open method is safer and more appropriate than the laparoscopic approach are when the surgeon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> assistants are not experienced in the use of an operative laparoscope, when there are dense adnexal adhesions, when the ovary is very large, or when there is a high suspicion of malignancy. Minilaparotomy is an alternative &quot;in-between&quot; approach.</p><p>Surgeons must use good judgment and be selective in the cases chosen for laparoscopic treatment. The following criteria are generally accepted guidelines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laparoscopic approach is reasonable for patients whose preoperative evaluation suggests benign disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109384 \">table 2</a>). These patients include those with probable dermoids, endometriomas, or physiological cysts that have not resolved with conservative management or are associated with acute symptoms. A laparoscopy may be converted to a laparotomy if the surgeon encounters a difficult dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gynecologic laparoscopic surgery and non-umbilical entry sites&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative findings suspicious for malignancy (ascites, enlarged nodes, matted bowel, excrescences, multiple nodular areas) usually warrant conversion to an open evaluation. However, a smooth appearance on the surface of the cyst does not exclude the possibility of a malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing cysts in a specimen bag reduces both operating time and spillage. Controlled intraperitoneal spillage of benign cyst contents (eg, cystic teratoma) does not increase postoperative morbidity as long as the peritoneal cavity is copiously lavaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cysts that are complex should be removed, not fenestrated, given the possibility of malignancy and high recurrence rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A solid adnexal mass that is small enough to be removed intact via colpotomy or via a laparoscopic bag can be managed laparoscopically. Solid masses can also be mobilized laparoscopically and then removed through a mini-laparotomy incision or morcellated inside a specimen bag.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10499406\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of robotic or single port laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newer minimally invasive approaches, such as robot-assisted or single port laparoscopy (also referred to as laparoendoscopic single-site surgery [LESS]), may also be used for oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy. </p><p>There are few data regarding robot-assisted laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy. The only report is a retrospective cohort study comparing women who underwent adnexectomy using robot-assisted (n = 85) or conventional laparoscopy (n = 91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. No differences were found between surgical approaches regarding blood loss, intraoperative complications, or length of hospital stay. Operative duration was 12 minutes longer for robotic-assisted versus conventional procedures. The authors commented that they prefer to approach large adnexal masses with conventional laparoscopy, because trocar placement is more flexible, manipulation of large masses is easier, and intraoperative drainage can be accomplished.</p><p>Ovarian surgery using a LESS approach is a developing field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Improvements in postoperative pain and cosmetic results were reported by a randomized trial (n = 60) that compared LESS with conventional laparoscopy for oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Operative duration and complication rates were similar for the two approaches. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Oophorectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oophorectomy may be performed through an abdominal incision, laparoscopically, or vaginally (at the time of hysterectomy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Open or laparoscopic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the abdomen is entered, pelvic and abdominal washings are obtained and saved to use for staging if a malignancy is subsequently diagnosed. The entire pelvis, abdomen and retroperitoneum (eg, diaphragm, omentum, viscera, kidneys) are inspected for sites suspicious for carcinoma (excrescences, thick adhesions, nodules, enlarged nodes) should be biopsied and sent for frozen section.</p><p>If findings are consistent with benign disease, the infundibulopelvic ligament and ureter are identified. The peritoneum is incised parallel to the ovarian vessels and the retroperitoneal space is entered. Alternatively, the round ligament can be divided to enter the retroperitoneal space.</p><p>Using either blunt dissection or meticulous sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors (preferable) or other laparoscopic instruments, the broad ligament is opened and the ureter identified on its medial, or posterior, leaf.</p><p>If the fallopian tube is to be removed, the ovarian vessels are then elevated to allow good visualization of the nearby ureter, doubly clamped, divided, and the pedicles doubly ligated to ensure hemostasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69337%7EOBGYN%2F79076%7EOBGYN%2F58049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69337 graphicRef79076 graphicRef58049 \">figure 2A-C</a>). Both the ovarian ligament and fallopian tube are clamped parallel and just lateral to the uterine cornu and then excised; the cornu is then ligated.</p><p>If the fallopian tube is to be preserved, the multiple tubal branches of the ovarian artery should be clamped and ligated inferior and parallel to the tube in a systematic fashion. This separates the ovary from the fallopian tube and allows clear visualization of the ovarian branch of the uterine artery. Subsequently, the ovarian artery can be clamped, divided, and ligated. The utero-ovarian ligament is then clamped parallel and just lateral to the uterine cornu and excised; the cornu is then ligated.</p><p>Some surgeons advocate performing a wedge resection of the fallopian tube stump and approximating the surrounding cornual edge of myometrium to decrease the chance of a uteroperitoneal fistula, ensure hemostasis, and prevent the theoretical risk of a cornual ectopic pregnancy. There are no data to support or refute this approach, which may add to the total blood loss and duration of the procedure.</p><p>In open cases, microsurgical techniques and fine absorbable suture material may help to minimize postsurgical tubal adhesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several methods for performing an oophorectomy with the laparoscope.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bipolar electrosurgery &ndash; The infundibulopelvic ligament is grasped with bipolar forceps, elevated off of the ureter, and desiccated after visually ascertaining that the ureter is clear of this area. The ligament is then transected with endoscopic scissors and the broad ligament incised up to the utero-ovarian ligament. The medial attachments of the adnexa to the uterus, including the blood supply, can also be desiccated with the bipolar forceps or tied off using endoscopic loop ties and then excised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stapling devices &ndash; Endoscopic stapling devices are a less popular method for controlling the various attachments to the ovary since they are usually more difficult to manage, require larger trocars, and are more expensive. The ureter, which can be easily caught in the jaws of the stapling device, must be carefully identified and excluded from the area being crushed and stapled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasonic cutting and coagulation device &ndash; An ultrasonic cutting and coagulation device (eg, Harmonic Scalpel) uses ultrasonic vibration, which denatures protein and generates secondary heat, resulting in coagulation. The device contains a cutting blade which allows for fewer instrument changes. This device can be used to cut across the meso-ovarium, utero-ovarian ligament, or the ovarian vessels. Care must be taken to visualize the ureter and prevent catching it in the blades.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bipolar vessel sealing device &ndash; Bipolar vessel sealing devices (eg, Ligasure, Enseal, Gyrus-PKS) use bipolar current to seal vessels, and many of these devices have a blade which is activated to cut tissue. As with an ultrasonic cutting and coagulation device, care must be taken to ensure the ureter is free of blades before firing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop technique &ndash; The most common loop technique is to slip the ovary through two or three pre-tied loops that have been introduced through a separate puncture site. The adnexa must be free of adhesions and mobile before placing the loops; this occasionally requires lysis of adhesions and incising the mesosalpinx to facilitate placement. The loops are cinched down around the vascular pedicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71204\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71204 \">figure 3</a>) and then the adnexa is excised distal to the loops. The ureter must be visualized before and after this procedure to insure that it has not been pulled into the pedicle or kinked. Visualization is achieved by observing peristalsis through the peritoneum or, preferably, by opening the peritoneum and directly observing the ureter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the abdomen is entered, pelvic and abdominal washings are obtained and saved to use for staging if a malignancy is subsequently diagnosed. The entire pelvis and abdomen (eg, diaphragm, viscera, omentum) are inspected for carcinoma; suspicious sites (excrescences, adhesions, nodules, enlarged nodes) should be biopsied and sent for frozen section.</p><p>Before actually performing the cystectomy, all adhesions should be carefully divided to allow proper mobilization of the ovary and restore the normal relationship between it and the other pelvic structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Open cystectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elliptical incision is made over the thin ovarian cortex in the axis of the ovary and over its most dependent area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76556%7EOBGYN%2F55587\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76556 graphicRef55587 \">figure 4A-B</a>). The area adjacent to the fallopian tube and the fimbria ovarica should be avoided to limit potential injury to the fallopian tube.</p><p>In addition, risk adhesion formation is minimized by avoiding excessive handling of the ovary and keeping the operative field. After the initial incision, the back of the knife handle or Metzenbaum scissors can be used to develop the plane between the cyst wall and the ovarian cortex to shell out the cyst while applying counter traction with an Allis clamp on the cortex. Occasionally the base of the cyst is very adherent to the ovarian stroma and requires excision with Metzenbaum scissors or electrocautery.</p><p>Every attempt should be made to remove the cyst intact; however, if the cyst ruptures, care should be taken to control the spill and avoid gross contamination of the abdominal cavity (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Spillage of malignant cells'</a> below). This can usually be achieved by packing the surrounding areas with surgical packs and carefully placing a clamp across the defect in the cyst wall. In the event of a cyst rupture, the abdominal cavity should be copiously irrigated to decrease the risk of both pseudomyxoma peritonei and chemical peritonitis, admittedly rare occurrences.</p><p>After removal of the cyst, the deep tissues of the ovary can be left open if hemostasis is adequate (preferable), or reapproximated if hemostasis is needed, avoiding sutures on the capsule of the ovary. The ovarian cortex may appear thin, but should not be trimmed because this may remove viable ovarian tissue.

As with an open procedure, all adhesions should be lysed prior to beginning cyst removal. A cystotomy can then be performed, or if dissection around the cyst is possible, the cyst can be removed intact.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To perform a cystectomy &ndash; The cyst may then be punctured with a 16 to 18 gauge needle or with cautery.

The forceps grasping the cyst wall can be rotated to assist in the dissection and actually peel away the cyst wall from the surrounding ovary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61558%7EOBGYN%2F73354%7EOBGYN%2F52353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61558 graphicRef73354 graphicRef52353 \">figure 5A-C</a>).

The bag can be removed through a secondary port or through the infraumbilical trocar site after the port has been removed. However, an intact cyst may, in some cases, actually facilitate dissection from the ovarian stroma.

Any suturing that is done should avoid the surface of the ovary. Cautery is also very effective for hemostasis, but should be kept to a minimum to reduce tissue destruction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxidized-regnerated-cellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxidized regenerated cellulose</a> (Interceed, TC7) can be applied through the laparoscope to deter adhesion formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large cysts &ndash; A variety of approaches to laparoscopic removal of large cysts (10 cm or greater) have been suggested. Large cysts can be aspirated, either preoperatively, using ultrasound guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], or intraoperatively, after placing the cyst in a laparoscopic specimen bag [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Performing open laparoscopy may avoid puncture of the cyst during initial placement of laparoscopic instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. To reduce the risk of intraperitoneal spillage, laparoscopically guided minilaparotomy can be used for large cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. If ovarian conservation is planned, the presence of a large cyst should not change the surgeon's goal. No matter how large the cyst, it is always possible to save ovarian cortex and hormonal function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteral injuries have been reported with open or laparoscopic oophorectomy when ureteral identification was performed incorrectly. Although the ureter can be seen through the peritoneum in many patients, in others the peritoneum must be opened and varying degrees of dissection carried out to expose it. Additional potential complications related to the laparoscopic approach are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80157 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Spillage of malignant cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>vCapsule rupture of an ovarian tumor may worsen prognosis, although data are mixed and not definitive.

In rare cases, the remaining ovarian tissue may be from congenital supernumerary ovaries. It should be distinguished from the residual ovary syndrome (ROS), in which the ovary was intentionally preserved and subsequently developed pathology.</p><p>Failure to skeletonize the infundibulopelvic ligament and placement of a clamp that is not sufficiently lateral to the ovary may result in retention of a piece of the ovary in the pedicle, leading to ORS. This is more common when the procedure is complicated by dense adhesions (eg, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease), neoplastic disease, and increased pelvic vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Intraoperative bleeding, anatomic variation, or deviation from sound surgical principles also contribute to incomplete removal of ovaries. Blunt dissection to free the ovaries from surrounding tissues must be avoided because it risks leaving behind remnants of the ovarian cortex, which can become neovascularized by the adjacent pelvic peritoneum or viscera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The typical patient presents with cyclic pelvic pain and a mass, although the pain may be persistent with acute flare-ups. Occasionally, an asymptomatic mass is detected on pelvic or sonographic examination. Ureteral obstruction may occur.</p><p>ORS is probably present if a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level is in the premenopausal range or if serum estradiol levels are normal after bilateral oophorectomy; however, some women with ORS have postmenopausal levels of FSH and estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Other signs suggestive of the syndrome are (1) cyclic menstruation in a woman whose uterus had been retained at bilateral oophorectomy and (2) relief of symptoms after medical therapy which suppresses ovarian function (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, combined hormonal contraception). After unilateral oophorectomy, the diagnosis is suggested by the typical clinical manifestations combined with a pelvic mass on the side of the oophorectomy.</p><p>In one large series (n = 186 cases), ultrasound examination showed a pelvic mass in 93 of 100 patients who had preoperative testing; computed tomograms were positive for a pelvic mass in 67 of 73 patients, and magnetic resonance imaging identified a mass in 7 of 9 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. If ORS is suspected, but imaging is negative, one group suggested repeated imaging after ovarian stimulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The surgical treatment of ORS is to excise the remaining ovarian tissue, a procedure that is usually difficult and requires meticulous dissection to delineate the normal anatomy in an otherwise abnormal pelvis. The ureter must be identified and both it and the bowel may have to be mobilized clear of the pelvic side wall. The remnant is usually encased in adhesions and frequently is retroperitoneal, therefore the best approach is through the retroperitoneum. Skilled and experienced surgeons may approach ovarian remnants using minimally invasive surgical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>], but it is prudent to have consent for laparotomy, which may be required to complete the procedure.</p><p>The remnant may be difficult to delineate from the surrounding tissues if a definite mass or cyst is not present. Superovulating the remnant before the operation may facilitate identification and successful excision. The key to being sure the ovary is removed is to identify the infundibulopelvic ligament and to transect all tissue attachments of ovarian tissue allowing several millimeters of margin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Fertility following unilateral oophorectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data regarding fertility following unilateral oophorectomy. Fertility following removal of one ovary had been studied most frequently in women with ovarian cancer or tumors of low malignant potential who undergo conservative surgery. In these patients, literature reviews have reported widely varying pregnancy rates, ranging from 42 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Regarding women undergoing in vitro fertilization, data are mixed regarding whether women with a single ovary have a lower conception rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].
