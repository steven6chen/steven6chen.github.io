The various phenotypes in the disorder are mostly due to varying degrees of impairment in AR function.

Newborns with a female phenotype can also be diagnosed with CAIS if prenatal karyotyping identified a 46,XY karyotype.</p><p>In CAIS, testes may be located in the abdomen or inguinal region. The site and size of the testes can sometimes be defined by ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>The AR is coded by a single-copy gene on the X chromosome. The diagnosis of CAIS can mostly be confirmed by sequencing the coding region of this gene. Loss-of-function mutations in the coding sequence of the AR can be found in most women with CAIS.

In addition to clinical and biochemical features, the diagnosis requires a 46,XY karyotype as well as determination of androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels (at baseline or after human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] stimulation) in order to exclude defects in testosterone biosynthesis and 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency or genetic defects affecting gonadal development as in partial gonadal dysgenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

If AR function is more significantly impaired, there can be complete failure of scrotal fusion, a micropenis with perineoscrotal hypospadias, and a pseudovagina. When AR function is only mildly impaired, men have a male genital phenotype but have gynecomastia, infertility, and a scanty beard and pubic hair. This is also referred to as mild androgen insensitivity.

Thus, this diagnosis should be considered in men with severe idiopathic oligospermia or azoospermia, in whom the multiplication product of basal LH and testosterone values is elevated.

Therefore, molecular genetic studies are needed to make or confirm the diagnosis. The AR gene has a coding region of eight exons and is located on chromosome Xq11-12. It encodes a protein of approximately 920 amino acids, which compose the typical three major functional domains of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Over 1000 mutations, as well as some larger structural alterations, have been described in patients with all forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome, and these mutations can be spread out over the whole coding region. To detect deletions or duplications of exons or the entire gene, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis is now also routinely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While mutational analysis may confirm the diagnosis of androgen insensitivity syndrome, a genotype-phenotype correlation in PAIS does not exist, and therefore, further clinical prognosis is very difficult to predict. In a subset of patients with PAIS, de novo post-zygotic mutations may have occurred, which resulted in a somatic mosaicism of functioning wild-type and dysfunctional mutated AR in a single patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This needs to be taken into account for genetic counseling. Newer diagnostic approaches, such as next-generation and whole-exome sequencing are also now being used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no therapy to prevent or reverse the development that occurs during embryogenesis in patients with androgen insensitivity syndromes. Management is therefore initially focused on counseling of families and providing assistance in gender assignment of infants with ambiguous genitalia. Management should then address functional issues, timing of gonadectomy to prevent tumor formation in cryptorchid testes, hormone replacement or supplementation at the appropriate time in life, surgery as appropriate for individuals raised as male or female, treatment of gynecomastia in men, and psychological support for the patient and family. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At this time, in several countries around the world, management of disorders of sex development (DSD), including androgen insensitivity syndrome, are debated vigorously. As a rule, gender assignment may be delayed until a final diagnosis has been reached and a reliable prognosis can be made. Irreversible procedures, particularly surgical corrective surgery, should be performed only after informed consent by the patient. The diagnostic and management procedures should ideally be performed by a multidisciplinary team in a center with expertise in DSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Three ethical principles that apply to management of DSD have been published by a working group within the German Network <span class=\"nowrap\">DSD/Intersex:</span> to foster the well-being of the child and the future adult, to uphold the rights of children and adolescents to participate in <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> self-determine decisions that affect them now or later, and to respect the family and parent-child relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

One survey suggests that the frequency of male sex assignment has increased in DSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It is now possible to not assign a legal sex in Germany, because of changes in the personal status law. Any decision on gender assignment must consider medical issues as well as local cultural and legal considerations.</p><p>In the past, the possibility of future potential fertility was not a consideration in gender assignment. However, development of intracytoplasmic sperm injection for in vitro fertilization using rare spermatozoa obtained by testis biopsy suggests that many men with azoospermia may be potentially fertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This also favors male sex assignment in 46,XY DSD.

Tumors (germ cell tumors and gonadoblastomas) occur in approximately 1.5 to 2 percent of undescended testes, more often in abdominal than in inguinal testes. Some of these tumors may become malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Cryptorchidism is also common in prepubertal boys with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) and should be corrected surgically soon after diagnosis to maintain testicular function and minimize the risk of malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367887602\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of gonadectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carcinoma in situ of the testis has been described in prepubertal girls with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), but its importance is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (formerly called intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type)&quot;</a>). Girls with CAIS have a normal pubertal growth spurt and feminize at the time of expected puberty (secondary to aromatization of androgen to estrogen), and testicular tumors do not usually develop until after this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Therefore, gonadectomy in women with CAIS is now typically delayed (in some countries such as Germany) until sexual maturation is complete. This approach also respects patient autonomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. However, in some situations, the convenience of combining gonadectomy with hernia repair or the need to relieve symptoms of discomfort from labial or inguinal testes may justify removal of the testes before puberty.</p><p>In phenotypic women with PAIS, gonadectomy has so far been performed when the diagnosis was made or before the time of expected puberty to prevent the progressive virilization that may occur. However, as current practice requires full informed consent and the assessment of a stable gender identity, pubertal development may be delayed with the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367887722\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormone replacement or supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For CAIS and PAIS individuals who are phenotypic females or are raised as female after surgical treatment of ambiguous genitalia, hormone treatment is indicated when gonadectomy is performed after puberty or at the time of expected puberty if gonadectomy was performed prepubertally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Again, this requires consent of the patient, who should be informed about the underlying condition. In girls of pubertal age, low doses of estrogen should be begun to promote feminization and should be gradually increased to full adult doses, similar to induction of puberty protocols. The age and dose of initiation depend upon the child's growth percentile, growth velocity, bone age, target height, and predicted adult height. Adult women can be given full estrogen replacement immediately. The use of testosterone as a hormone supplementation in CAIS has not been approved and is currently under investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;, section on 'Estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with PAIS assigned to the male sex, the efficacy and safety of long-term, high-dose androgen therapy given to overcome androgen resistance has not been systematically assessed. One prepubertal boy with PAIS was administered high doses of testosterone, resulting in greater phallic growth than did usual doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], and two prepubertal boys were treated successfully with transdermal dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is characterized by a variable phenotype from phenotypic women with mild virilization to phenotypic men with undervirilization and gynecomastia or infertility. The differences in these various phenotypes are due to variable degrees of loss of function of the androgen receptor (AR). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for CAIS is m&uuml;llerian agenesis in adults, and for PAIS, the differential diagnoses are mixed or partial gonadal dysgenesis, defects in testosterone synthesis, and steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The capacity for testosterone synthesis in infants and children with suspected CAIS and PAIS should be assessed by the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 1000 to 2000 international units per day for three to five days (or alternatively 5000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> in a single dose), with measurement of serum androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Adults are evaluated with basal hormone samples. (See <a href=\"#H199670177\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In normal prepubertal boys and in those with CAIS and PAIS, hCG stimulation causes an increase in serum testosterone to above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. The majority of individuals with CAIS and PAIS have normal serum testosterone responses after the administration of hCG. Elevation of androstenedione or of the ratio of testosterone to DHT may help identify impaired testosterone synthesis due to 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency and steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency, respectively. The AMH and inhibin B levels should be within the normal male reference range in patients with CAIS or PAIS. (See <a href=\"#H199670177\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DNA for the AR gene should be sequenced in subjects suspected to have CAIS or PAIS based on consistent clinical features and hormonal studies, although the probability of finding a mutation is low in PAIS subjects with negative family histories.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists might prevent undesired virilization if time is needed for counseling and decision making.
