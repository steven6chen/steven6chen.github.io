Hyponatremia is among the most common electrolyte abnormalities in children. Drops in sodium level can lead to neurologic findings and in severe cases significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with acute and rapid changes in plasma or serum sodium.</p><p>The etiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and evaluation of pediatric hyponatremia are reviewed here. Hyponatremia in adults is discussed separately.

As examples, the reported incidence of hyponatremia was 17 percent of children at the time of hospital admission in Japan, which was higher in febrile children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence increased to 45 percent in an Italian study in children with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is most likely due to the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) associated with a number of clinical conditions that result in hospitalization. These include hypovolemia, fever, head injury, central nervous system (CNS) infections, and respiratory disorders (eg, pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>In addition, in-hospital interventions, such as recent surgery (which is associated with ADH release), and the administration of hypotonic intravenous solutions, may contribute to the development of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The effect of administered hypotonic intravenous solution on the development of hyponatremia, especially in children with persistent ADH release, was illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from the United States of 1048 children who had normal serum sodium levels at the time of presentation, overall 35 percent of the cohort developed hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients who received hypotonic fluids were more likely to develop hyponatremia than those who received isotonic fluids (39 versus 28 percent). Additional identified risk factors for hyponatremia included admitting diagnoses of a cardiac or <span class=\"nowrap\">hematologic/oncologic</span> condition, and surgical admission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational Canadian study of 432 hospitalized children who had two or more measurements of plasma sodium, 40 patients developed hospital-acquired hyponatremia due to the administration of excessive free water as hypotonic solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H952883043\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia is caused by an imbalance in the body's handling of water, resulting in a relative deficit of effective plasma osmolality (tonicity) to total body water. The plasma tonicity is defined as the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross the cell membrane, which is primarily due to sodium (Na) salts in the extracellular space. As a result, serum or plasma sodium is used as a surrogate for assessing tonicity. In this topic, we will use plasma, but in general, serum and plasma sodium can be used interchangeably. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H37261099\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>The formulas used to estimate plasma tonicity are similar to those for plasma osmolality, with the one exception that the contribution of urea (an ineffective osmole) is not included.

The homeostatic mechanisms that mediate plasma tonicity and water balance are similar in adults and children, resulting in a normal range of plasma sodium between 135 and 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> that does not vary by age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H96014898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a>.)</p><p>In children, the underlying pathogenesis for hyponatremia is typically due to excess free water retention that can be classified according to volume status as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypovolemia and appropriate ADH levels &ndash; In most pediatric cases, hyponatremia occurs in children with hypovolemia most commonly due to gastrointestinal loss, who are managed by an excess administration of free water in the setting of an elevated ADH activity. In such patients, ADH is <strong>appropriately</strong> released due to volume depletion. When hypotonic fluids are ingested or administered, free water is retained in excess of solutes resulting in a <strong>decrease</strong> in plasma sodium concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Less commonly, pediatric hyponatremia may be caused by loss of sodium in excess of water (eg, urinary salt wasting in obstructive uropathy, skin losses in cystic fibrosis), which results in volume depletion and a decrease in plasma sodium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normovolemia and <strong>inappropriate</strong> ADH levels &ndash; In volume replete individuals, excess water intake normally suppresses ADH release allowing for free water excretion and the generation of a dilute urine. However, several pediatric conditions are associated with inappropriate ADH release that results in retention of free water with fluid intake, leading to a drop in plasma sodium. These include pulmonary and oncologic disorders, recent surgery, central nervous system (CNS) injury or infection, endocrine disorders, and certain medications.

Most pediatric cases of hyponatremia are due to hypovolemic conditions (eg, gastroenteritis) that are associated with an appropriate elevation in ADH, which in the setting of excess free water repletion leads to water retention and a drop of plasma sodium that may result in hyponatremia. Other less common conditions associated with excess salt loss (eg, renal salt-wasting disorders) are also usually characterized by volume depletion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal losses &ndash; The most common cause of hypovolemia in children is gastroenteritis. Other less common causes of pediatric gastrointestinal losses include secretory and osmotic diarrheas, enteric fistulas, and ostomies. Rehydration with free water in patients with significant gastrointestinal losses may lead to hyponatremia.

Acutely, the initial volume loss can stimulate ADH release. As a result, the combination of diuretic-enhanced sodium and potassium excretion, and the resultant water retention due to ADH release from hypovolemia can result in excretion of urine with a higher solute concentration than that of plasma, leading to a drop in plasma sodium.

It is characterized by hyponatremia and extracellular fluid depletion due to inappropriate renal sodium wasting. In a case series of 110 children, the most common CNS conditions associated with cerebral salt wasting were intracranial surgery, meningoencephalitis, and head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In this setting, the major factors for developing hyponatremia are the high rate of fluid consumption and the persistent secretion of ADH due to the initial hypovolemia.

However, persistent ADH release and water retention in normovolemic children can be seen in a number of disorders associated with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93177\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93177 \">table 1</a>). These include pulmonary (eg, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, mechanical ventilation), CNS (eg, brain injury and infections, and CNS tumors), and endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism and cortisol deficiency).

In this disorder, patients drink excessively large volumes of water that result in lower plasma sodium levels despite suppression of ADH release. Primary polydipsia has been reported in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and has been described in a toddler who mimicked the water loading behaviors of his mother in the setting of psychosocial stress at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

As the plasma sodium falls, an osmotic gradient develops between the intravascular space and the intracellular space, resulting in water movement from the extracellular space into the intracellular space. Volume shifts are attenuated to some extent by both acute and chronic regulatory mechanisms that exist in cells to minimize cell volume shifts (ie, cerebral adaption). The more rapid and extensive the degree of change, the less time is available for regulatory mechanisms to minimize cell volume change and the less efficacious these changes will be. Because of limited space in the skull, such rapid shifts may significantly increase brain volume and result in cerebral edema with concomitant neurologic signs and symptoms.</p><p>Plasma sodium levels &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> are less likely to produce any specific symptoms, and children tend to only manifest the symptoms of their underlying acute illness.

For patients in whom ongoing monitoring of sodium is needed, this variation based on sampling technique and method of analysis should be kept in mind while managing patients with abnormal sodium values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543496771\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnoses for true hyponatremia are pseudohyponatremia (also referred to as factitious hyponatremia). In pseudohyponatremia, a low plasma sodium concentration is associated with normal plasma osmolality. In patients with pseudohyponatremia, a marked elevation in serum lipids or proteins in the fraction of serum that is water results in a falsely depressed sodium level when electrolyte measurement is performed using <strong>indirect</strong> ion-selective electrode potentiometry. When a <strong>direct</strong> ion-selective electrode is used, this false decrease in serum sodium does not occur. Although an increasing number of laboratories use direct ion-selective electrode techniques, in facilities using the older method, this interference needs to be kept in mind when interpreting low sodium results. Factitious hyponatremia is associated with increased serum osmolality and is commonly seen with hyperglycemia in diabetic patients.

Although dehydration is the most common clinical scenario leading to hyponatremia in children, because antidiuretic release may be triggered by stimuli other than volume depletion, the hyponatremic child may also be euvolemic or hypervolemic, and clinical assessment of volume status is paramount. Since the etiology of pediatric hyponatremia can be categorized by volume status (low, normal, high), and the appropriateness of antidiuretic hormone secretion, the history and physical examination should focus on determining the volume status of the child, the history of excessive free water intake, and evidence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) effect based on urinary output and evidence of a concentrated urine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of fluid loss (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, profound bleeding, diuretic therapy) and signs of extracellular volume depletion (eg, decreased skin turgor, tachycardia, or orthostatic or persistent hypotension) are indicative of hypovolemia, which is associated with appropriate ADH secretion and retention of free water.

Although this will tend to lower the plasma osmolality, this effect is counterbalanced to a variable degree by the associated elevation in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), resulting in a plasma osmolality that may be normal or elevated. However, there is a difference between the measured plasma osmolality and the effective plasma osmolality in patients with renal failure.

Accordingly, for the next two days, her total fluid needs is 2800 mL (800 mL of remaining fluid deficit, and 2000 mL for two days of maintenance needs [daily rate of 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day])</span> with total sodium needs of 245 mEq (185 mEq of the remaining sodium deficit and 60 mEq for two days of maintenance needs [daily rate of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day])</span>. Any excess ongoing losses of fluid and sodium would also need to be replaced.</p><p>If there are no ongoing losses, then the provision of half isotonic saline at a rate of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> x 48 hours would best approximate these needs. During infusion of this fluid, plasma sodium should be assessed every four to six hours initially to make sure that the rate of correction is not proceeding too quickly. Urine output and concentration should also be carefully monitored during the correction phase, as excess free water retention may occur due to ADH release, in which case adjustments in either the rate of fluid administration or the tonicity of replacement fluid (isotonic saline) may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1146134597\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia is defined as a serum or plasma sodium less than 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and is among the most common electrolyte abnormalities in children. Although the true incidence is unknown, hyponatremia is often observed in children on admission to the hospital and is a common complication of in-hospital interventions. (See <a href=\"#H952883037\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia is caused by an imbalance in the body's handling of water, resulting in a relative deficit of effective plasma osmolality (tonicity) to total body water. Plasma or serum sodium is typically used as a clinical surrogate for assessing tonicity. The pathophysiology and etiology of pediatric hyponatremia can be classified based on the patient's volume status. Hyponatremia most commonly occurs in children with hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal loss, who are managed by an excess intake of free water in the setting of an elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) activity. Other causes include the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), which typically occurs in normovolemic patients and is associated with several clinical conditions (pulmonary and oncologic disorders, recent surgery, central nervous system injury or infection, endocrine disorders, and certain medications), and less common hypervolemic conditions, such as renal failure and disorders with a reduced effective circulating volume (ECV; eg, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, and cirrhosis). (See <a href=\"#H952883043\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H952883049\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence and severity of clinical manifestations correlate with the degree of plasma or serum sodium depression, its rate of decline, and chronicity. The range of findings varies from no symptoms (especially in patients with chronic hyponatremia, defined as duration greater than 24 hours) to severe neurologic symptoms (eg, seizure and coma). (See <a href=\"#H952883158\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hyponatremia is made by the detection of a plasma or serum sodium level below 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The differential diagnosis includes pseudohyponatremia and factitious hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"#H952883085\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H543496771\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation is focused on determining the underlying cause of hyponatremia and includes clinical assessment and further laboratory evaluation. In many cases, the etiology is evident from the history. However, when the diagnosis remains uncertain, laboratory tests (plasma and urine osmolality, and urine sodium) can help determine the underlying etiologies due to SIADH, the presence of other solutes that increase plasma osmolality, renal salt loss, or decreased ECV and impaired renal perfusion. (See <a href=\"#H543496929\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of hyponatremia includes identifying children who are hospitalized that are at risk for developing hyponatremia (eg, those with SIADH). In these patients, fluid and electrolyte therapy needs to be individually tailored to prevent the administration of excessive free water. (See <a href=\"#H543496726\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of hyponatremia consists of correcting hyponatremia with one or more interventions including fluid restriction, administration of sodium chloride, and treatment of the underlying etiology. Management decisions are based on determining the magnitude and cause of the sodium deficit, the rate of sodium decline, the volume status of the patient, the presence of severe symptoms, and the chronicity of hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"#H543496732\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that the rate of correction for pediatric hyponatremia does not exceed an increase of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> over a 24-hour period (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Overly rapid correction can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in diffuse demyelination in the brain and the development of profound irreversible neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1146134172\" class=\"local\">'Rate of correction'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hasegawa H, Okubo S, Ikezumi Y, et al.
