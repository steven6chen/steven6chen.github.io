Endothelial tissue damage from a variety of underlying disorders (eg, sepsis, trauma, and malignancy) activates the coagulation cascade, which promotes fibrin production and deposition, and consumption of clotting factors. The subsequent consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, inhibition of natural anticoagulants and fibrinolysis, and fibrin deposition result in the clinical picture of DIC of a bleeding diathesis accompanied by microvascular thrombosis that often leads to end organ damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78959\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78959 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79998 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of DIC in infants and children will be reviewed here.

In preterm infants, fibrinogen concentration is low and D-dimer is commonly present without DIC, limiting their value in the diagnosis of DIC.

As an example, a PT in the upper normal range but considerably longer than an earlier measurement reflects the consumptive process of DIC and not a normal hemostatic state.

The most helpful tests clinically are those that indicate the presence of fibrinolysis (eg, D-dimer). As previously discussed, D-dimer is a more specific test for DIC than fibrin degradation products. The latex agglutination assay for D-dimer is commonly used and is one of the more reliable tests.</p><p>While not routinely required for the diagnosis, decreased levels of factors V and VIII help substantiate the diagnosis of DIC. Factor VIII levels can be used to distinguish DIC from coagulopathy associated with severe liver disease. Factor VIII is not produced by hepatocytes and thus is often low in DIC and increased or normal in liver disease.

It assesses patients with an underlying medical condition known to be associated with DIC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59455 \">table 1</a>) and is based upon readily available global coagulation tests (platelet count, FDPs, PT, and fibrinogen) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74304 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Scores are dependent on the degree of abnormality measured by each test (eg, a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL</span> is scored higher than <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Japanese Association for Acute Medicine</strong> &ndash; The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) scoring system for DIC is similar to the ISTH system in that it uses the same four laboratory parameters (platelet count, FDPs, PT, and fibrinogen) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106312 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, the JAAM scoring system places more attention on trends in platelet counts rather than a single measurement. </p><p/><p>Both the ISTH and JAAM scoring systems have been validated in adult patients and have been found to correlate with mortality and morbidity risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Limited pediatric data suggest that these scoring systems perform reasonably well in pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Despite a lack of robust data, these scoring systems are routinely used in the pediatric intensive care unit setting. There are no available data on the use of DIC scoring systems in neonates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to older patients, the diagnosis of DIC in the neonate relies on abnormal global coagulation tests in the appropriate clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, it is more difficult to establish the diagnosis of DIC in these neonates. Testing is limited because the volume of blood required may be difficult to obtain in the neonate. In addition, the interpretation of these studies in the neonate is challenging as the hemostatic system is still in a state of flux at birth with physiologic alterations of coagulation and fibrinolysis. As a result, the diagnosis of DIC in the neonate may rely more heavily on the patient's clinical manifestations than on laboratory studies. The recognition of the underlying condition rather than establishing the diagnosis of DIC is more important as the most important therapeutic intervention is to treat the underlying disorder. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Neonates'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is broad and includes other diseases associated with bleeding symptoms, abnormal coagulation tests, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia. The history, clinical setting, and laboratory evaluation, usually differentiate DIC from other causes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/coagulopathy</strong></span> &ndash; Hepatic failure and vitamin K deficiency have similar clinical findings as those with DIC, but the platelet count is typically normal.

In contrast to DIC, patients with ITP are typically otherwise well-appearing and coagulation tests are normal.

As a result, successful treatment of DIC is dependent on identifying and treating the underlying cause, thereby removing the triggering factors implicated in the DIC process. In some cases, successful treatment of the underlying cause will lead to resolution of DIC. In others, despite vigorous therapy directed towards the primary disease, coagulation abnormalities persist resulting in significant hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis with organ damage. These patients have a high rate of mortality, and as a result, commonly receive DIC supportive therapy.</p><p>There is no consensus on how supportive therapy should be used due to the paucity of data. In general, supportive care is divided into component replacement and anticoagulation therapy. Treatment is individualized based upon a patient's age, severity of clinical symptoms, underlying primary disorder, and overall clinical status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been no randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of platelet, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or cryoprecipitate transfusions in children or adults with DIC. Nevertheless, the use of these agents seems rational in patients with significant bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and clotting factor consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Our approach for replacement therapy in patients with DIC is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications</strong> &ndash; Replacement therapy is indicated in patients with DIC who have clinically significant bleeding symptoms or who are at high risk for bleeding because of an impending invasive procedure. Examples of clinically significant bleeding may include gastrointestinal bleeding (not merely a positive guaiac test), prolonged bleeding from venipuncture sites, prolonged epistaxis, or prolonged bleeding after suctioning the endotracheal tube. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Goals</strong> &ndash; The aim of replacement therapy is to reduce or stop significant bleeding, <strong>not</strong> to normalize laboratory tests (which often is impossible). Reasonable goals for the judicious use of blood components in the setting of clinically significant bleeding include maintaining platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL</span> and fibrinogen concentration &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Choice of replacement products</strong> &ndash; Clotting factors can be replaced by either FFP or cryoprecipitate. FFP provides both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins and is administered every 12 to 24 hours at a dose of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per infusion. Cryoprecipitate has higher concentrations of factor VIII and fibrinogen, and can be used to correct hypofibrinogenemia. It is administered every 6 hours as needed at a dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per infusion. Platelet transfusions are administered with a goal of maintaining the platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Repeat transfusions</strong> &ndash; Repeat transfusions may be necessary. The theoretical concern of replacement therapy increasing thrombotic risk by &quot;adding fuel to the fire&quot; has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and should not dissuade the clinician from administering replacement therapy to control significant bleeding. Clinicians should monitor for volume overload in patients who receive factor replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heparin has a very limited role in the management of DIC. In adults with DIC, heparin is sometimes used in treatment doses for patients with predominantly thrombotic manifestations and without bleeding, or in prophylactic doses for critically ill patients without bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In children, it is our practice to administer heparin only to patients with life-threatening or symptomatic thrombi (eg, acral ischemia or skin infection) without clinical bleeding. Heparin is contraindicated in patients with central nervous system (CNS) injury or liver failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention/treatment of thrombosis'</a>.) </p><p>Except for the unusual patients described above, heparin is generally avoided for patients with DIC because of its potential to exacerbate bleeding, and because there are no controlled trials that demonstrate a benefit in children or adults with DIC. In the past, heparin was routinely used in patients with clinically overt thrombosis and potential end-organ failure, but there is little evidence that its use improved organ dysfunction. </p><p>If the clinical decision is made to administer therapeutic doses of heparin, continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) is often preferred because it allows for finely tuned titration and can be quickly turned off should bleeding occur. The starting dose of UFH should be lower than is typically used for treatment of thromboembolic disease (we typically start the continuous IV infusion at 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour). For children with DIC, loading doses generally should <strong>not</strong> be used. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been used in adults with DIC but there are no data to assess its effectiveness in children with DIC. In children, anti-factor Xa levels should be monitored during treatment with either unfractionated heparin or LMWH.

It results from activation of the coagulation system by a variety of underlying disorders (eg, sepsis, trauma, and malignancy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59455 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations vary depending on the ability of the hemostatic system to compensate for the ongoing depletion of coagulation factors and platelets. In mild cases, bleeding may only be noted at venipuncture sites, but in more severe cases there may be extensive hemorrhage and thrombosis with end-organ damage to the kidney, liver, lung, extremities, and central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of DIC is based on both clinical findings (eg, hemorrhage and microthrombi in a patient with a predisposing medical condition) <strong>and</strong> abnormal coagulation studies. No single test confirms the diagnosis. Laboratory values must be evaluated in aggregate, and serial testing is more informative than single measurements. Scoring systems have been developed to assist in diagnosing DIC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74304 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106312 \">table 5</a>).
