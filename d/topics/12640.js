Thus, during normal hematopoiesis, there exists a cellular hierarchy headed by a stable population of pluripotent stem cells that generate lineage-specific progenitors, which differentiate into the various types of mature blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Effective hematopoiesis is facilitated by interactions of hematopoietic growth factors, various receptors, and the bone marrow microenvironment.</p><p>An operational classification of hematologic malignancies distinguishes lymphoid from myeloid neoplasms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110239 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110240 \">table 2</a>); in turn, each of these categories is classified as either acute or chronic, depending upon the proportion of morphologically and immunophenotypically immature precursors (blasts) in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Thus, the myeloid hematologic malignancies are divided into acute myeloid leukemia (AML; bone marrow or peripheral blood blasts of 20 percent or more) and the chronic myeloid disorders (bone marrow or peripheral blood blasts less than 20 percent). However, in the presence of certain recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities (eg, t(8;21), inv(16)), a diagnosis of AML is made regardless of the blast count.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The chronic myeloid disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic myeloid disorders encompass several clinicopathologic entities.

The paradox of proliferative bone marrow together with peripheral blood cytopenias in MDS may be explained by increased intramedullary myeloid precursor cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), unlike MDS, usually exhibit terminal myeloid cell expansion in the peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
