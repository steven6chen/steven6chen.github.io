This section will review the findings in the three largest placebo-controlled trials and in meta-analyses. Trials comparing the efficacy of different antihypertensive drugs are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H12986312\" class=\"local\">'Which antihypertensive drugs should be used?'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">PROGRESS trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PROGRESS trial included over 6100 patients (mean age of 64 years) with an ischemic or, less often, hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous five years (median of eight months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The mean baseline blood pressure was <span class=\"nowrap\">147/86</span> mmHg; approximately one-half of patients were hypertensive (mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">159/94</span> mmHg), while remaining patients had high-normal values (mean of <span class=\"nowrap\">136/79</span> mmHg).</p><p>The following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">9/4</span> mmHg in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perindopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perindopril</a> group compared with placebo decreased the rate of the primary endpoint of fatal or nonfatal stroke (10 versus 14 percent with placebo, relative risk reduction 28 percent, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17 to 38 percent). Active therapy also reduced the risk of all cardiovascular events by 26 percent and, although the number of events was small, significantly reduced the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage by 50 percent (1.2 versus 2.4 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stroke prevention benefit was related to the degree of blood pressure reduction, being most prominent (relative risk reduction 43 percent) and statistically significant in patients treated with combination therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=perindopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perindopril</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indapamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indapamide</a>) who had a <span class=\"nowrap\">12/5</span> mmHg mean reduction in blood pressure compared with placebo. By comparison, patients treated with perindopril alone had only a <span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span> mmHg mean reduction in blood pressure and a small and not significant benefit (relative risk reduction 5 percent). The reductions in blood pressure were similar in the hypertensive and high-normal blood pressure groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reduction in recurrent stroke with antihypertensive therapy was seen in both hypertensive (11.1 versus 16.2 percent, relative risk reduction 32 percent) and nonhypertensive patients (9.1 versus 11.5 percent, relative risk reduction 21 percent). Thus, both the risk of stroke and the absolute benefit from antihypertensive therapy were greater in the hypertensive patients. Similar findings were noted when all major vascular events were evaluated.</p><p/><p>A post hoc analysis from PROGRESS addressed the issue of whether the baseline blood pressure affected the response to antihypertensive therapy, including the possibility that patients with normal blood pressure (&lt;120 mmHg systolic) at baseline might be harmed from such therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among patients in the combination therapy arm, the relative risk reduction in stroke was <strong>similar</strong> <strong>at all levels</strong> of baseline systolic pressure (ranging from &lt;120 to &ge;160 mmHg). Although this suggests no harm from therapy in patients with low baseline pressures, there were so few events (six) in the subgroup of 146 patients with a systolic pressure of &lt;120 mmHg at baseline that one cannot have confidence in the results.</p><p>There was also a suggestion that the risk of recurrent stroke was lowest in patients in the lowest quartile of attained blood pressure (median of <span class=\"nowrap\">112/72</span> mmHg) and progressively higher at higher blood pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the trial was not designed to evaluate different blood pressure goals.

All other antihypertensive drugs, except for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), were permitted as add-on therapy. Approximately three-quarters of patients had a prior history of hypertension, and the average blood pressure was <span class=\"nowrap\">144/84</span> mmHg in both groups at baseline.</p><p>At an average follow-up of 2.5 years, there was <strong>no</strong> significant difference between the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telmisartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telmisartan</a> and placebo groups in the primary outcome of recurrent stroke (8.7 versus 9.2 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.04), or in secondary outcomes including major cardiovascular events (13.5 versus 14.4 percent, HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87-1.01). However, significant benefit compared with placebo would not have been expected, since telmisartan therapy only reduced the blood pressure by an average of 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/2</span>.0 mmHg more than placebo. This finding is similar to the lack or benefit with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perindopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perindopril</a> monotherapy in the PROGRESS trial, in which in the mean difference in attained blood pressure was only <span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span> mmHg compared with placebo.

In addition, we recommend initiation of antihypertensive therapy for previously untreated patients with any type of ischemic stroke or TIA who have an established blood pressure of &ge;140 mmHg systolic or &ge;90 mmHg diastolic.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"#H420004\" class=\"local\">'ACC/AHA guidelines for the prevention of recurrent stroke'</a> below.)</p><p>Unlike the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ASA</span> guidelines, we suggest (a weaker recommendation) initiation of antihypertensive therapy for previously untreated patients with ischemic stroke or TIA of atherothrombotic, lacunar (small vessel occlusive), or cryptogenic type, whose baseline blood pressure is &gt;120 mmHg systolic or &gt;70 mmHg diastolic. This recommendation is based upon observations in randomized trials, such as PROGRESS, that the relative risk reduction in stroke with antihypertensive therapy was similar at <strong>all levels</strong> of baseline systolic pressure (ranging from &lt;120 to &ge;160 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>We do <strong>not</strong> suggest antihypertensive therapy in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonhypertensive patients (ie, blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/80</span> mmHg) who have had a stroke or TIA due to a cardioembolic phenomenon (eg, atrial fibrillation) or paradoxical embolus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Untreated patients whose baseline blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;120/&lt;70</span> mmHg.

In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials of almost 30,000 patients with a prior history of stroke, therapy with angiotensin inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) significantly, but modestly, reduced the risk of recurrent stroke (9.0 versus 9.7 percent) and major vascular events (14.3 versus 15.7 percent) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By contrast, there was no significant benefit of angiotensin inhibitors in the three trials that compared these agents with calcium channel blockers. In addition, calcium channel blockers may be superior to angiotensin inhibitors for the primary prevention of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Finally, the results of the Post-stroke Antihypertensive Treatment Study (PATS) trial (see <a href=\"#H587962398\" class=\"local\">'PATS trial'</a> above) suggest that diuretics are effective for secondary stroke risk reduction.</p><p>Based upon these observations, angiotensin inhibitors (most trials have used ACE inhibitors), calcium channel blockers, and diuretics are reasonable options for initial antihypertensive monotherapy in patients who have had a stroke. There is some evidence from clinical trials that beta blockers may <strong>not reduce</strong> stroke risk compared with angiotensin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and, in some trials, placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H420004\" class=\"local\">'ACC/AHA guidelines for the prevention of recurrent stroke'</a> below.)</p><p>However, the <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ASA</span> guidelines did not mention the ACCOMPLISH trial of combination antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive patients who required two drugs and were at high risk for a cardiovascular event (defined as a history of coronary disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, or diabetes, or the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy or impaired renal function) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

History of a prior stroke was present in 13 percent. The trial was terminated early at 36 months because of worse outcomes in the hydrochlorothiazide group that exceeded a prespecified stopping rule. Benazepril plus amlodipine, compared with benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide, significantly reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or cardiovascular complications (9.6 versus 11.8 percent, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.90) and the secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke (5.0 versus 6.3 percent, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.92).</p><p>Based upon these observations, we recommend the combination of an <strong>angiotensin inhibitor plus a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker</strong> rather than a diuretic as the combination antihypertensive regimen of choice in the treatment of patients who have had a stroke.

This response may be impaired in patients with chronic hypertension, including those who have not had a stroke.</p><p>Persistent hypertension leads to arteriolar thickening. In the cerebral and other circulations, this is in part an <strong>appropriate</strong> adaptation in that it prevents the increase in pressure from being transmitted to the capillary circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>However, arteriolar thickening can also limit the ability to maintain perfusion when the blood pressure is lowered with antihypertensive therapy since the vasodilator response is often impaired.
