(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, administration of antimicrobial therapy for treatment of symptomatic individuals with giardiasis is appropriate. However, some infections are self-limited, and it is reasonable to forgo treatment for patients with mild symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> contraindications to antimicrobial therapy. In addition, it is reasonable to forgo treatment of asymptomatic individuals in the absence of risk for transmission. We suggest treatment of asymptomatic individuals with giardiasis who are food handlers, household contacts of pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals, or children in a daycare or other setting who might transmit infection to others (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H295956593\" class=\"local\">'Nonpregnant adults and children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with giardiasis should be excluded from settings with risk for transmission to others (such as childcare centers or recreational water venues) until asymptomatic for 48 hours. Among patients with acute giardiasis who are treated appropriately, symptoms typically resolve within five to seven days. There is no need to repeat the stool examination to check for parasite clearance for individuals whose symptoms resolve. (See <a href=\"#H295956593\" class=\"local\">'Nonpregnant adults and children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preferred agents for initial treatment of giardiasis include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitazoxanide</a>. For treatment of giardiasis in patients &ge;3 years of age, we suggest tinidazole (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) since it has a longer half-life than nitazoxanide and may be administered as a single dose with high efficacy. For treatment of giardiasis in patients 12 to 36 months of age, we suggest nitazoxanide (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For treatment of giardiasis in patients &lt;12 months of age, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) given limited data regarding use of tinidazole and nitazoxanide for these patients. Drug dosing is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61810 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H295956593\" class=\"local\">'Nonpregnant adults and children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment of pregnant women with mild giardiasis who are able to maintain hydration and nutrition, it is reasonable to delay therapy until at least the second trimester, to minimize the likelihood of adverse drug effects for the fetus. If treatment is necessary during the first trimester, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), since it is associated with limited systemic absorption. During the second and third trimesters and for treatment of lactating women, reasonable antimicrobial agents include paromomycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitazoxanide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant and lactating women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent symptoms may be attributable to drug resistance, inadequate adherence, or immunosuppression. Recurrent symptoms after initial response to therapy may be due to persistent infection or reinfection. More often, however, persistent or recurrent symptoms occur as a result of noninfectious causes; these include postinfectious lactose intolerance, other absorptive deficiencies, and irritable bowel syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Persistent or recurrent symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with recurrent or persistent symptoms should have repeat stool examination for detection of giardiasis. Potential sources of reinfection should be sought by reviewing the exposure history, risk factors, and hygiene practices. In addition, patients with recurrent or persistent giardiasis warrant evaluation for underlying immunodeficiency.
