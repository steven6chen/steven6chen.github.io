The term &ldquo;preeclampsia with severe features&rdquo; is used when any of the features listed in the following table are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Women with preeclampsia with severe features are usually delivered promptly to prevent maternal and fetal complications. Since the disease is progressive and there is no medical treatment, delivery is always in the best interest of the mother. However, preterm delivery is not always in the best interest of the fetus; therefore, a decision to delay delivery can be considered under certain circumstances. The rationale for delaying delivery in these pregnancies is to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality by delivery of a more mature fetus and, to a lesser degree, to achieve a more favorable cervix for vaginal birth. The risk of prolonging pregnancy is worsening maternal endothelial dysfunction and continued poor perfusion of major maternal organs with the potential for severe end organ damage to the brain, liver, kidneys, <span class=\"nowrap\">placenta/fetus,</span> and hematologic and vascular systems.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues that should be considered in selecting women with preeclampsia with severe features for prompt delivery versus expectant management. The general management of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5980188\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists replaced the term &ldquo;severe preeclampsia&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;preeclampsia with severe features.&rdquo; This topic will use the term &ldquo;preeclampsia with severe features&rdquo;, but it should be noted that studies published before the change in terminology used different features to characterize the severe end of the preeclampsia spectrum. For example, the diagnosis of &ldquo;severe preeclampsia&rdquo; in these studies may have been based on hypertension with fetal growth restriction or proteinuria &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day,</span> which are no longer considered features of severe disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5979863\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A database of hospital discharge data from approximately 300,000 deliveries in the United States found the overall incidence of preeclampsia with severe features was approximately 1 percent of all pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Studies limited to nulliparous women report that approximately 5 percent develop preeclampsia and 40 to 50 percent of these women develop features of severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The incidence of preeclampsia with severe features before 34 weeks is 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, these figures were derived from studies using the pre-2013 definition of severe preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"#H5980188\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2262698\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSEQUENCES OF PREECLAMPSIA WITH SEVERE FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A literature review including 72 publications reported the following serious maternal complications of preeclampsia with severe features: seizures, pulmonary edema, hypertensive encephalopathy, stroke, renal failure, hepatic failure or rupture, retinal detachment or cortical blindness, disseminated intravascular coagulation, placental abruption, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The magnitude of increased morbidity associated with preeclamptic pregnancies was best illustrated in a controlled study that compared the pregnancy outcome of 319 women with &ldquo;mild&rdquo; or &ldquo;severe&rdquo; preeclampsia delivering their first baby to that of 3229 similar women whose blood pressure remained normal during the pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54736 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The major consequences of severe preeclampsia were increased rates of maternal liver and kidney dysfunction, induced labor, cesarean delivery, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal respiratory problems. </p><p>The consequences of preeclampsia with severe features depend, in part, on the gestational age at onset: early onset has a poorer prognosis than late onset. In the aforementioned study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the highest risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity was in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia with severe features in the second trimester. Although this study did not report a significant increase in the rate of fetal or neonatal death, others have found that earlier onset of severe preeclampsia and severely restricted fetal growth are associated with a dismal neonatal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5980252\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences of expectant management by gestational age</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2262705\"><span class=\"h3\">Second trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both maternal and fetal outcomes are poor with expectant management of preeclampsia with severe features with onset in the second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

The gestational age reflects the time of onset of expectant management. The median prolongation of pregnancy in the largest series was 5 days (range 0 to 25 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&lt;22+6<sup> </sup>weeks (56 fetuses, 2 percent survival)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>23+0 to 23+6 weeks (60 fetuses, 13 percent survival)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>24+0 to 24+6 weeks (75 fetuses, 33 percent survival)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>25+0 to 26+0 weeks (52 fetuses, 60 percent survival)</p><p/><p>Survivors are at high risk of short-term complications and long-term disability.

The pregnancies were at 28 to 32 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and 28 to 34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] weeks of gestation, and the diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features was based on blood pressure criteria alone. </p><p>Both trials reported significant prolongation of pregnancy and improvement in neonatal outcome with expectant management, with no increase in the rate of maternal complications. Prolongation of pregnancy averaged 15.4 days (range 4 to 36 days) in the larger of these trials (n = 95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and 7.1 days in the smaller trial (n = 38) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the larger trial, there were no cases of eclampsia or perinatal death and no increase in the frequency of placental abruption with expectant management (incidence of abruption: 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Importantly, infants in the expectantly managed group had a significantly higher gestational age at delivery (32.9 versus 30.8 weeks) and higher mean birth weight, lower rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (76 versus 100 percent), and lower rate of neonatal complications (respiratory distress 22 versus 50 percent; necrotizing enterocolitis 0 versus 11 percent).</p><p>A larger randomized trial (MEXPRE Latin Study) published in 2013 included 267 women at 28 to 33 weeks of gestation with severe preeclampsia based on blood pressure criteria plus proteinuria &gt;5 grams or end-organ symptoms (headache, visual disturbances, epigastric pain, tinnitus), but excluded those with HELLP, renal failure, pulmonary edema, and other comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Despite the exclusions, these patients had more signs and symptoms of severe disease than those in the two trials discussed above (patients had only severe hypertension). In this trial, expectant management resulted in prolongation of pregnancy (10.3 days versus 2.2 days for pregnancies treated with a course of antenatal corticosteroids followed by delivery in 24 to 72 hours); however, this did not result in significant neonatal benefit. Perinatal mortality was similar in the group expectantly managed and the group promptly delivered after steroids (9.4 versus 8.7 percent), as was composite neonatal morbidity (56.4 versus 55.6 percent). Furthermore, small for gestation age (SGA) and abruption outcomes were statistically more common with expectant management (SGA 21.7 versus 9.4 percent; abruption relative risk [RR] 5.07, 95% CI 1.13-22.7). The lack of benefit from expectant management compared with the previous two trials may have been due to selection of patients at the most severe end of disease spectrum. In addition, 40 percent of patients in the expectant management group were delivered for uncontrollable hypertension (compared to 6 percent in an earlier trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]), which suggests that more aggressive attempts at blood pressure control might have resulted in greater prolongation of pregnancy and, in turn, less morbidity from preterm delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2262719\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancies &lt;34 weeks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expectant management of appropriately selected patients with preeclampsia with severe features &lt;34 weeks appears to be associated with significant prolongation of pregnancy without increasing maternal morbidity. In a 2009 systematic review of observational studies of expectant versus interventionist care of preeclampsia with severe features &lt;34 weeks of gestation, expectant management (39 studies, 4650 women) was associated with pregnancy prolongation of 7 to 14 days and a median serious maternal complication rate of &lt;5 percent, which was similar to the complication rate with prompt intervention (2 studies, 42 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One-half of expectantly managed patients delivered for maternal indications and the other half delivered for fetal indications. Approximately 40 percent of the women with preeclampsia with severe features were appropriate candidates for expectant management.

This study assessed neurodevelopmental outcome at age 4.5 years in 216 children born after expectant management of severe hypertensive complications of pregnancy with onset between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation. All of the children were products of singleton gestations complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension, severe preeclampsia, HELLP, or eclampsia; 91 percent were small for gestational age at birth; and the mean gestational age at delivery was 31.4 weeks. At 4.5 years corrected age, there was an increased frequency of IQ that was subnormal (78 to 93) or abnormal (&lt;78) (30 percent versus 16 percent in the general population). Fifty-four percent of the children had normal results on all tests of developmental outcome. Seven percent of the children were attending special education classes, which is approximately seven times as many as the nationwide rate of 1 percent at that age in The Netherlands.

Factors critical in making this decision are the estimated fetal weight, growth restriction, and the neonatologist's judgment of the neonatal prognosis. If the fetus is deemed nonviable, we recommend delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periviable-birth-limit-of-viability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periviable birth (Limit of viability)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At 24 to 25 weeks of gestation, the decision-making process is exceptionally complex; the clinician and patient should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of expectant management, taking into account individual clinical factors such as the estimated fetal weight and whether a full course of corticosteroids can <span class=\"nowrap\">be/has</span> been administered.</p><p>Between 25 and 34 weeks of gestation, we offer expectant management to appropriately selected women, as described below.

It should be emphasized that expectant management of these pregnancies is not associated with any direct maternal benefits. The mother is taking on a small but significant risk to her own health in order to delay delivery until an older gestational age with a more favorable neonatal prognosis is reached for her child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These patients should be hospitalized and cared for by, or in consultation with, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. Such an approach should be undertaken only at facilities with adequate maternal and neonatal intensive care resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Close supervision of mother and fetus is crucial, as it is impossible to predict the clinical course of the disease after admission, and clinical deterioration can occur rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. After initial assessment and stabilization on the Labor and Delivery Unit (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above), these patients are monitored and medically managed on an antepartum unit. There are no data from randomized trials on which to base an evidence-based protocol for managing these pregnancies. Our general approach to management on the antepartum unit is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalize until delivery. Findings from frequent maternal and fetal assessment are reviewed throughout the day and the ongoing risks of conservative management versus the benefit of further fetal maturation are reevaluated frequently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor blood pressure every four hours.
