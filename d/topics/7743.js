Sugar gets into the cells with the help of a hormone called insulin. If there is not enough insulin, or if the body stops responding to insulin, sugar builds up in the blood. That is what happens to people with diabetes.</p><p>Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that affects some women when they are pregnant. It happens because pregnancy increases the body's need for insulin, but the body cannot always make enough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648849\"><span class=\"h1\">What does gestational diabetes do to a woman and her baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can make the baby get too big (heavier than 9 pounds). That is a problem, because a big baby can get hurt if it cannot fit easily through the birth canal. A big baby can also damage his or her mother's body during delivery. Sometimes, the baby will not fit and the mother has to have a c-section (surgery to get the baby out).</p><p>Gestational diabetes also increases the risk that a woman will have a life-threatening problem during pregnancy called preeclampsia. (Preeclampsia causes high blood pressure, among other things.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648856\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I get gestational diabetes during my pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is hard to predict which women will get gestational diabetes. But some women are more likely to get it than others. You are more likely to get gestational diabetes if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had it before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diabetes in your family</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older than 25</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are Hispanic-American, African-American, Native American, South or East Asian, or Pacific Islander</p><p/><p>Some habits might reduce your risk of gestational diabetes. These include losing weight before pregnancy if you are overweight, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648863\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I be tested for gestational diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. All pregnant women are tested for gestational diabetes.</p><p>Most women should be tested when they are about 6 or 7 months pregnant. (That's the same as 24 to 28 weeks pregnant.) But women at high risk for diabetes might need to be tested earlier in pregnancy.</p><p>There are a few ways to test for diabetes. A common way is to have you drink a special, sweet drink. Then, an hour or more later, your doctor or nurse will take some blood. That way he or she can see how high your blood sugar gets after you eat sugar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648870\"><span class=\"h1\">How is gestational diabetes treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To treat your gestational diabetes, you will need to check your blood sugar often. This is something you can learn how to do on your own with an easy-to-use machine. Most women can control their blood sugar level by changing their diet. Some women also need insulin shots or other diabetes medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648877\"><span class=\"h1\">How should I change my diet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A registered dietitian can tell you how to change your diet. Each woman is a little different, so there is no single diet that is right for everyone. Even so, most women should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sweets and fatty foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose bread, pasta, and rice made with whole grains</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648884\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I exercise?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You do not need to exercise to treat gestational diabetes. But being active will help control your blood sugar and weight. If you already exercise, you can usually keep doing what you have been doing, but check with your doctor or nurse. If you have not been exercising and want to start, ask your doctor or nurse what kind of activity is safe for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648891\"><span class=\"h1\">How often do I need to see the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with gestational diabetes need to see the doctor or nurse more often than other pregnant women. How often you go will depend on how you are doing at each visit, and on whether you use insulin. During these visits, the doctor or nurse will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check on your baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask about your diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your blood sugar levels are where they should be</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjust your dose of insulin or other medicine (if you take medicine)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648898\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I have a normal delivery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your blood sugar levels have been close to normal, chances are good that you will have a normal delivery. During delivery, your doctor or nurse will check your blood sugar to make sure that it is not too high.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648905\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after I give birth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your diabetes will probably go away and your blood sugar will probably go back to normal. If you were taking insulin or another medicine, you probably will not need it anymore. Even so, your doctor or nurse should check your blood sugar to make sure your levels get back to normal and stay that way. Women who have gestational diabetes are at very high risk of getting &quot;regular&quot; diabetes later in life. You should get checked for diabetes 2 or 3 months after you give birth, then every few years for the rest of your life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469648912\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-before-and-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nutrition before and during pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gestational diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
