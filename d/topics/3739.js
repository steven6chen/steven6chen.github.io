It also shares some histologic and clinical features with giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA), the other major large-vessel vasculitis. Patients may present initially with constitutional symptoms but later develop symptoms associated with vascular damage.</p><p>The pathogenesis, pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of TAK will be reviewed here. The treatment of this disorder is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Takayasu arteritis&quot;</a>). Overviews of the vasculitides in children and in adults are also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-classification-and-incidence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Classification and incidence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304122200\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women are affected in 80 to 90 percent of cases, with an age of onset that is usually between 10 and 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It has a worldwide distribution, with the greatest prevalence in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In Japan, it has been estimated that 150 new cases occur each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; by comparison, the incidence is one to three new cases per year per million population in the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is poorly understood. Cell-mediated mechanisms are thought to be of primary importance and may be similar to those in giant cell arteritis (GCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunohistopathologic examination has shown that the infiltrating cells in aortic tissue mainly consist of killer cells, especially gamma delta T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These cells may cause vascular injury by releasing large amounts of the cytolytic compound perforin. Recognition of heat shock protein-65 might facilitate recognition and adhesion of the infiltrating cells. In another report, the T cell receptors on the infiltrating T cells had a restricted repertoire, suggesting that a specific but as yet unidentified antigen in aortic tissue might be targeted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This change was not seen in atherosclerotic aortic aneurysms.</p><p>The inflammation may be localized to a portion of the thoracic or abdominal aorta and branches, or may involve the entire vessel. Although there is considerable variability in disease expression (possibly due to geographic differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]), the initial vascular lesions frequently occur in the left middle or proximal subclavian artery. As the disease progresses, the left common carotid, vertebral, brachiocephalic, right middle or proximal subclavian artery, right carotid, vertebral arteries, and aorta may also be affected. The abdominal aorta and pulmonary arteries are involved in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The inflammatory process within the vessel can lead to narrowing, occlusion, or dilation of involved portions of the arteries, which causes a wide variety of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms in Takayasu arteritis (TAK) tends to be subacute, which often leads to a delay in diagnosis that can range from months to years, during which time asymptomatic vascular disease may start and progress. However, symptoms of vascular disease are rare at presentation but later become clinically apparent due to dilation, narrowing, or occlusion of arteries, resulting, variably, in cyanosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain in arms or legs (limb claudication), lightheadedness or other symptoms of reduced blood flow, arterial pain and tenderness, or nonspecific constitutional symptoms.</p><p>The following features can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Constitutional symptoms</strong> &ndash; Constitutional symptoms are common in the early phase of TAK, including weight loss and low-grade fever. Fatigue is very common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthralgias</strong> &ndash; Arthralgias or myalgias occur in about one-half of cases. Clinically evident synovitis is less common. Articular symptoms can be transient or continuous over several months or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carotidynia</strong> &ndash; Carotidynia is observed in 10 to 30 percent of patients at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absent or weak peripheral pulse(s)</strong> &ndash; Absent or diminished peripheral pulses is most common at the level of the radial arteries and is often asymmetric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In advanced cases, occlusion of the vessels to the extremities may result in ischemic ulcerations or gangrene; however, such complications are usually precluded by the development of collateral arterial circulation in the areas involved by vasculitis. Collateral vessels are evidence of the chronic nature of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limb claudication</strong> &ndash; Limb claudication may be observed. Subclavian artery involvement is common, and a stenotic lesion proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery can lead to neurologic symptoms or syncope related to the so-called subclavian steal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this phenomenon, retrograde flow through the vertebral artery supplies the subclavian distal to the stenosis and vasodilation of the arterial bed in the upper limb with exercise compromises posterior cerebral blood flow (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclavian-steal-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclavian steal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclavian-steal-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclavian steal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Upper extremity ischemia'</a>). Other claudicatory symptoms are common, including mild to severe upper- or lower-extremity pain with modest activity, often limiting patients' functional capacity for activities of daily living, ambulation, or employment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arterial bruit </strong>&ndash; Bruits are usually audible over the subclavian arteries, brachial arteries, carotid arteries, and abdominal vessels. Clinical signs of aortic regurgitation due to dilatation of the ascending aorta may be present in patients who have this abnormality, and moderate to severe stenosis can be present even in the absence of a bruit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discrepant blood pressure between arms</strong> &ndash; Reduced blood pressure in one or both arms is common; a differential of more than 10 mmHg between the arms is typically present and pressures may be unmeasurable, especially by automated devices. It is imperative for patients and clinicians to be aware of such unreliable blood pressure readings to ensure proper pressures are recorded in limbs not affected by arterial narrowing; this frequently requires measuring the blood pressure in legs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertension</strong> &ndash; Hypertension develops in more than one-half of cases due to narrowing of one or both renal arteries, or narrowing and decreased elasticity of the aorta and branches. Severe (malignant) hypertension may occur. However, narrowing or occlusion of the arteries in the arms may make it difficult to assess the blood pressure. In these cases, the blood pressure may be measured using a wide cuff on an uninvolved thigh, or by direct measurements of the proximal aorta via arterial catheterization. Because TAK often affects young people, modest elevations in blood pressure are often overlooked. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angina</strong> &ndash; Angina pectoris occurs due to coronary artery ostial narrowing from aortitis or coronary arteritis. Myocardial infarction and death may occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal symptoms</strong> &ndash; Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage may result from mesenteric artery ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin lesions</strong> &ndash; Skin lesions resembling erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum are found over the legs in a minority of cases. The lesions frequently show vasculitis of small vessels on biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory symptoms</strong> &ndash; The pulmonary arteries are involved pathologically in up to 50 percent of cases; however, symptoms related to pulmonary arteritis are less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pulmonary manifestations include chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dyspnea may also be due to angina or heart failure resulting from aortic dilation, aortic regurgitation, or malignant hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic symptoms</strong> &ndash; Involvement of the carotid and vertebral arteries causes decreased cerebral blood flow, leading to lightheadedness, vertigo, syncope, orthostasis, headaches, convulsions, and strokes. Visual impairment is a late manifestation and is due to cerebral ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2007320801\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several aspects of the physical examination merit particular attention whenever a patient TAK is seen in clinical practice. Measurement of blood pressure should be done in all four extremities to evaluate for arterial stenoses and accurately measure the true central arterial pressure. Many patients with TAK will have partial or complete occlusion of one or both subclavian, axillary, or brachial arteries, or the brachiocephalic artery, leading to falsely low pressure readings in the ipsilateral arm. Similarly, femoral or more distal arterial stenoses will falsely lower leg blood pressures and stenosis of the aorta may lead to bilateral low blood pressure readings. It is important that clinicians, nurses, and other clinical staff enter all four extremity blood pressure readings into a patient's medical records to best allow for determination of which readings are reliable and to gain insight into the patient's vascular anatomy.</p><p>Bruits should be listened for over the bilateral carotid, subclavian, axillary, renal, and femoral arteries, as well as the abdominal aorta. Cardiac auscultation may reveal signs of aortic valvular disease, pulmonary hypertension, or heart failure. Pulses should be felt for and evaluated (full, reduced, absent) at bilateral temporal, carotid, brachial, femoral, and dorsal pedal arteries, and any arterial tenderness should also be noted. Signs of limb ischemia should be sought. Availability of a device to using Doppler technology can enhance the vascular examination in patients with TAK. Physical examination may reveal findings suggestive of vascular disease. Many of the abnormal exam findings above have been shown to be fairly specific, although not highly sensitive, for identification of arterial lesions subsequently confirmed by imaging tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory abnormalities in patients with TAK are nonspecific and generally reflect an inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Acute phase reactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may be elevated; however, these tests do not reliably reflect disease activity and can be normal in the setting of active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Other abnormalities that may be observed in the complete blood count include a normochromic normocytic anemia suggestive of the anemia of chronic disease as well as a leukocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4221290415\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058124080\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, a clinical diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis (TAK) can be made in a patient with both suggestive clinical findings (eg, constitutional symptoms, hypertension, diminished or absent pulses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial bruits) and imaging showing narrowing of the aorta <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its primary branches. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1607540921\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Occasionally, the diagnosis of TAK is made incidentally either in patients with imaging consistent with vasculitis obtained for other clinical indications (eg, &quot;aortitis&quot; suspected on an abdominal computed tomography [CT] obtained to evaluate for possible malignancy or incidentally discovered aortic aneurysm) or when vasculitis is found on histologic examination of surgically removed segments of arteries. In such circumstances, we recommend examining other regions of the aorta and its primary branches with either magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography (CTA) and considering the possibility of a diagnosis of another form of large-vessel vasculitis.</p><p>There are no diagnostic laboratory tests for TAK. Testing for acute phase reactants such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may provide additional support for the presence of a systemic inflammatory process; however, normal values of ESR or CRP should not markedly deter making the diagnosis of TAK.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1607540921\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies are essential for establishing the diagnosis of TAK and for determining the extent of vascular involvement. Patients with suspected TAK should undergo imaging of the arterial tree by MRA or CTA to evaluate the arterial lumen. The diagnostic and physiologic importance of arterial wall enhancement on MR or CT imaging remain uncertain. In general, we favor using MRA to evaluate for TAK since it avoids the radiation exposure and risks of iodinated contrast of CTA; similarly, if periodic repeat studies are anticipated, MRA is again the preferred choice.</p><p>Imaging of the arterial tree of the chest, abdomen, head and neck, or other areas by MRA or CTA demonstrates smoothly tapered luminal narrowing or occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F95682\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95682 \">image 1</a>) that is sometimes accompanied by thickening of the wall of the vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62264%7ERHEUM%2F70960\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62264 graphicRef70960 \">image 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. Color Doppler ultrasound examination of the common carotid and proximal subclavian arteries may show vessel wall thickening and luminal narrowing, especially if bruits or diminished pulses are found on examination, and may provide complementary information to <span class=\"nowrap\">MRA/CTA</span> about hemodynamics. However, ultrasound examination cannot reach vessels in deeper areas, and multiple procedures and more time are necessary to cover the same regions seen by a single MR or CT study.</p><p>While conventional arteriography generally provides clear outlines of the lumen of involved arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93976\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93976 \">image 3</a>), it does not allow arterial wall thickening to be assessed (the importance of which is not fully clear) and is an invasive test associated with some risks. Therefore, if a therapeutic intervention (eg, stenting for revascularization) is not anticipated, a less invasive imaging technique is preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-takayasu-arteritis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Takayasu arteritis&quot;, section on 'Revascularization'</a>.)</p><p>Catheter-based angiography allows for the measurement of core blood pressure, and this may be needed when four-limb arterial stenosis prevents accurate blood pressure assessments; documenting aortic pressures should always be part of this procedure. Furthermore, cardiac catheterization may be a critically important form of angiography to perform when cardiac ischemia is suspected. When selected site angiography is planned, it may be quite appropriate to extend the scope of the study to include <span class=\"nowrap\">more/all</span> of the aorta and primary branches since the initial risk of arterial puncture was already planned; time, costs, and the risks of using additional contrast dye must be considered.</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET), often in combination with CT (PET-CT) or MR (PET-MR) is an increasingly utilized test to evaluate for possible large-vessel vasculitis. The finding of &quot;hot&quot; segments (ie, those with increased standardized uptake values [SUVs]) in the right clinical setting may be quite suggestive of large-vessel vasculitis. However, the exact role for PET in diagnosis of TAK is not clear and the use of PET to measure disease activity in large-vessel vasculitis is even more problematic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3410552108\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of TAK is seldom made histologically since biopsy of the large arteries is obviously impractical. However, occasionally arterial tissue may become available after a revascularization procedure or aneurysm repair. Such tissue samples should be sought whenever reasonably feasible if it will help either establish a diagnosis or evaluate the state of the disease (eg, active inflammation versus inactive scar) and lead to change in therapy.</p><p>Active inflammation is indicated by the presence of mononuclear cells, predominantly lymphocytes, histiocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Giant cells and granulomatous inflammation are typically found in the media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Destruction of the elastic lamina and the muscular media can lead to aneurysmal dilation of the affected vessel. Alternatively, progressive inflammation and dense scarring may proceed from the adventitia leading to a compromise of the vascular lumen. Intimal proliferation may also contribute to the development of stenotic arterial lesions. If active inflammation abates, dense scar tissue remains as an indication of prior vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2330398599\"><span class=\"h2\">Nomenclature and classification criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disease names and definitions of the vasculitides continue to evolve as our understanding of the pathogenesis advances. The international Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) has developed one of the most widely used nomenclature systems which specifies the names and definitions for most forms of vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The CHCC nomenclature system has changed over the past few decades, and definitions that were put forth by the CHCC in 1994 have since been revised in the 2012 CHCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F90188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90188 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F90189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90189 \">table 2</a>).

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria were developed to help distinguish one form of vasculitis from another, but they are limited in terms of their use in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/2,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at disease onset &le;40 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Claudication of the extremities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased pulsation of one or both brachial arteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difference of at least 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure between the arms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruit over one or both subclavian arteries or the abdominal aorta</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arteriographic narrowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or lower extremities, not due to arteriosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or other causes</p><p/><p>Patients are said to have TAK if at least three of the six criteria are present.</p><p>Although the ACR criteria and the CHCC nomenclature system have been widely used by clinical researchers and clinicians to help diagnose patients, accurate diagnostic criteria have yet to be developed. With an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of vasculitis and improved laboratory testing, the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) are in the process of making an international effort to develop revised classification criteria and diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis (TAK) includes atherosclerotic, inflammatory, infectious, and hereditary diseases that affect the large arteries.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giant cell arteritis &ndash; Perhaps the most difficult distinction is between TAK and giant cell arteritis (GCA). Both conditions involve the aorta and its major branches and are indistinguishable histopathologically. Distinction between the two disorders can usually be made based upon the age of the patient and the distribution of lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68594 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], although such a dichotomy is strongly driven the by the somewhat arbitrary age-based criteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, with the increasing recognition of overlapping clinical features of these two conditions, and especially that GCA may involve the aorta and its major branches in at least 30 percent of patients, the differentiation between TAK and GCA has become more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-takayasu-arteritis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG4-related disease &ndash; IgG4-related disease has been recognized as a rare cause of noninfectious aortitis. Histologic evidence of lymphoplasmocytes and storiform fibrosis as well as non-arterial manifestations of disease can differentiate IgG4-related disease from TAK. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease#H179281773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;, section on 'Aortitis and periaortitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious aortitis &ndash; Similar to TAK, patients with infectious aortitis may present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever and elevated acute phase reactants. However, patients with TAK will have negative blood cultures. Infections of the aorta usually lead to aneurysm formation. Mycobacterial infection of the aorta can present with a more chronic process that bacterial infections. On computed tomography angiography (CTA), patients with infectious aneurysms may have a perivascular fluid collection or intramural air, whereas inflammatory aneurysms often have findings suggestive of periaortic fibrosis and adhesions of adjacent structures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infected-mycotic-arterial-aneurysm#H3895948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infected (mycotic) arterial aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Infected versus inflammatory aneurysm'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic causes of aortic aneurysms &ndash; Genetic defects that lead to abnormalities in connective tissue metabolism can predispose patients to thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. Examples include Marfan syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and Turner syndrome. Patients with these conditions generally do not have systemic symptoms as do patients with TAK. These conditions are associated with a specific genetic abnormality and other typical clinical features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm#H2050023984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Syndromic connective tissue disorders'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm#H2343049294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Turner syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromuscular dysplasia &ndash; Fibromuscular dysplasia must be considered when large arterial stenosis are seen. However, this syndrome often has characteristic radiographic findings, is usually more focal in its involvement, and is not associated with the systemic symptoms of TAK. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherosclerosis &ndash; It is likely that atherosclerosis is the cause of more lesions of the aorta and its major branches than all forms of inflammatory disease combined. Differentiating atherosclerosis from vasculitis may be easier in younger people but can be a challenge in many patients. Longer, smoother, non-calcified lesions are more characteristic of non-atherosclerotic disease. However, atherosclerosis can be associated with some degree of inflammation and increased signal on positron emission tomography (PET), and luminal characteristics are not fully reliable when evaluating lesions. Furthermore, patients with large-vessel vasculitis can also develop atherosclerosis. Evaluation of all patients with TAK for risk factors and evidence of atherosclerosis is appropriate.

Women are affected in 80 to 90 percent of cases, with an age of onset that is usually between 10 and 40 years. It has a worldwide distribution, with the greatest prevalence in Asia. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1304122200\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of TAK is poorly understood. The inflammation may be localized to a portion of the thoracic or abdominal aorta and branches, or may involve the entire vessel. Although there is considerable variability in disease expression, the initial vascular lesions frequently occur in the left middle or proximal subclavian artery. As the disease progresses, the left common carotid, vertebral, brachiocephalic, right middle or proximal subclavian artery, right carotid, vertebral arteries, and aorta may also be affected. The abdominal aorta and pulmonary arteries are involved in approximately 50 percent of patients. The inflammatory process within the vessel can lead to narrowing, occlusion, or dilation of involved portions of the arteries in which causes a wide variety of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of symptoms in TAK tends to be subacute, which often leads to a delay in diagnosis that can range from months to years, during which time asymptomatic vascular disease may start and progress. However, symptoms of vascular disease are rare at presentation but later become clinically apparent due to dilation, narrowing, or occlusion of arteries, resulting, variably, in cyanosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain in arms or legs (limb claudication), lightheadedness or other symptoms of reduced blood flow, arterial pain and tenderness, or nonspecific constitutional symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination of a patients with TAK should particularly focus on accurate measurements of blood pressure, palpation of pulses, identification of bruits, and careful cardiac auscultation. (See <a href=\"#H2007320801\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TAK should be suspected in a patient who has constitutional symptoms, hypertension, diminished or absent pulses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial bruits. In most cases, the diagnosis is based upon suggestive clinical features and specific imaging findings of the aorta <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its branches. Additionally, TAK or other forms of large-vessel vasculitis must be considered either in patients incidentally found to have findings suspicious for vasculitis on imaging obtained for other clinical indications or when vasculitis is found on histologic examination of surgically removed segments of arteries. (See <a href=\"#H2058124080\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no diagnostic laboratory tests for TAK. Testing for acute phase reactants such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may provide additional support for the presence of a systemic inflammatory process; however, normal values of ESR or CRP should not markedly deter making the diagnosis of TAK. (See <a href=\"#H2058124080\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies are essential for establishing the diagnosis of TAK and for determining the extent of vascular involvement. Patients with suspected TAK should undergo imaging of the arterial tree by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) to evaluate the arterial lumen. In general, we favor using MRA to evaluate for TAK. since it avoids the radiation exposure and risks of iodinated contrast of CTA; similarly, if periodic repeat studies are anticipated, MRA is again the preferred choice. Imaging of the arterial tree of the chest, abdomen, head and neck, or other areas by MRA or CTA demonstrates smoothly tapered luminal narrowing or occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F95682\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95682 \">image 1</a>) that is sometimes accompanied by thickening of the wall of the vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62264%7ERHEUM%2F70960\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62264 graphicRef70960 \">image 2A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1607540921\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of TAK include giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA), IgG4-related disease, Beh&ccedil;et's syndrome, infectious aortitis, fibromuscular dysplasia, atherosclerosis, genetic causes of aneurysms such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and other diseases which can feature large-vessel <span class=\"nowrap\">vasculitis/aortitis</span> such as Cogan's syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, and spondyloarthropathies.
