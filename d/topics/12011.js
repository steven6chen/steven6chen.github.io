OCD may also occur during these periods and poses unique clinical challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rigorous epidemiologic studies are not available, but women may be at an increased risk for OCD during or following pregnancy, including new-onset OCD, recurrence, or exacerbation of a chronic disorder illness.</p><p>The mother's obsessional thoughts often focus on the baby, and the associated compulsive behaviors may suggest the potential for harm to the mother or child. Though relatively rare, the risk for harm should be carefully monitored. In some cases, intervention (eg hospitalization) may be required to ensure safety.</p><p>OCD is an often-disabling illness that is frequently difficult to treat. Partial responses to treatment are common as are subsequent relapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Presentations during pregnancy and postpartum frequently go undetected and untreated.</p><p>This topic reviews OCD during pregnancy and postpartum. The presentation, assessment, and treatment of OCD in the general population are discussed elsewhere.

Estimates of the prevalence of OCD in pregnant and postpartum women were found to be greater than the estimated prevalence in the general population (2.07 and 2.43 versus 1.08 percent). Further research is needed to determine the significance of the difference in rates observed in pregnancy and postpartum, and on whether OCD prevalence differs by trimester.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies are mixed on whether the prevalence of OCD is greater among pregnant and postpartum woman compared with the estimated one-year prevalence of between 0.5 to 2.1 percent in the general United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. An analysis of data from interviews with 115 Canadian women three months postpartum found perinatal prevalence rates of OCD of 3.9 percent (95% CI 1.7-6.1), which included prevalence of 2.9 percent during pregnancy and 3.6 percent in the postpartum period; these rates were higher than those seen in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A prospective study of OCD in pregnancy found a prevalence of 1.2 percent among 497 women in their third trimester, which is comparable to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Several earlier, retrospective studies suggested that OCD may be more common among pregnant and postpartum women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Our clinical experience suggests that OCD is more common postpartum than during pregnancy, though research findings vary on this point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/8,9,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11-13</a>]. The largest of these studies found an OCD prevalence of four percent among 302 postpartum women, but this study was limited by a high rate of nonparticipation (38 percent) in the randomly selected sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Studies suggest that OCD may occur at a higher rate in the presence of postpartum depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Although the overwhelming majority of reported cases of postpartum OCD are women, men have been reported to develop OCD after the birth of a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Differences between women and men in age of onset of OCD have been observed. Onset in women peaks between 20 to 29 years of age, and is most common during the childbearing years, while onset in men is highest in mid-adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One theory expands on the &quot;serotonin hypothesis&quot; of OCD, proposing that fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy and postpartum affect serotonin levels in the brain, leading to OCD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. Preliminary evidence suggests that onset or worsening of OCD symptoms may be associated with fluctuations of these hormones at specific points of the female reproductive cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Oxytocin, a hormone that is elevated in postpartum women, also functions as a neurotransmitter; however, a relationship between postpartum oxytocin levels and OCD symptoms has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H408548053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>One hypothesis derived from cognitive-behavioral theory describes a possible path for the development of postpartum obsessions and compulsions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21</a>]. Many new parents may experience fleeting thoughts of harming their child. An example is the thought or mental image of shaking the baby. In people with OCD these unwanted, intrusive thoughts may be assigned a heightened level of meaning and responsibility. In order to neutralize the thought, the parent engages in compulsive rituals that produce emotional relief. This conceptualization suggests that treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy should focus on helping the patient to understand and address maladaptive beliefs they have assigned to the intrusive thoughts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenting features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The obsessional thinking and compulsive behaviors of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often focus on the pregnancy or baby. During pregnancy, obsessions are often about fears of fetal death or contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. An example of contamination is a mother's belief that she is infected and if she holds her baby the infection will spread to the baby as well. Postpartum, obsessive thoughts, or mental images of harming the baby are common, as are fears of contamination of the baby. Examples of aggressive thoughts or mental images include dropping the baby onto the floor, drowning the baby in the bathtub, throwing the baby out the window, crushing the baby's skull, or microwaving the baby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/10,14,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,23-25</a>].</p><p>Compulsive behaviors may include the mother's repeated requests for ultrasounds to check fetal wellbeing prior to birth, or subsequent avoidance of touching the baby, or subjecting the baby to repeated washing or changing. Other examples of obsessions and compulsions are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77826\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77826 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/9,13,14,18,22-24,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14,18,22-24,26-28</a>]. The rate at which aggressive obsessions toward the baby lead to harmful behaviors is not known, but such acts are believed to be relatively rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H408548123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with OCD often have insight into their obsessions, recognizing them as intrusive and inappropriate, though their degree of insight can vary. When severe obsessive thoughts persist over a long period of time, they can resemble fixed delusional thinking. On very rare occasions, these thoughts can progress to psychosis, where the patient believes the <span class=\"nowrap\">ideas/thoughts</span> are real. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-psychosis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum psychosis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-postpartum-psychosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of postpartum psychosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of harm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a lack of research data on patient characteristics in this population that predict harmful acts, but clinical experience suggests that risk factors include the stated intent to cause harm, psychotic thoughts, poor insight, poor impulse control, accompanying severe depression, low levels of family support, or a baby with more than usual needs. Avoidance of the baby carries a risk for neglect, with the potential for severe harm or even death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of OCD during pregnancy and postpartum has not been well studied. Studies have had small samples and found mixed outcomes, with varying proportions of patients improving, worsening, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staying the same [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/11,12,22,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,22,29</a>]. A 2016 prospective study followed 56 women with OCD at regular intervals throughout one year postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In that study, cesarean section births were associated with more postpartum obsessive compulsive symptoms than were vaginal deliveries.</p><p>In our clinical experience, women often present for the first time with obsessional thoughts during pregnancy and postpartum, and these obsessions can occur with or without associated compulsions. Women who have new onset of OCD in the perinatal period tend to have a milder course. In our experience, among women with preexisting OCD, earlier onset and greater severity tends to be associated with a more severe course during pregnancy or postpartum. These patients typically experience their usual obsessions and compulsions with the addition of those that are baby-centered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although screening for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among pregnant and postpartum women has not been rigorously studied, based on our experience we suggest that obstetricians or primary care clinicians administer a one-question screening in the course of prenatal and postpartum care. We suggest that clinicians caring for the mother or baby similarly screen the mother for the disorder periodically during the first six months after childbirth, beginning between week two and week four. Patients with a history of OCD should be assessed more frequently. Two illustrative screening questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;It's not uncommon for new mothers to experience intrusive, unwanted thoughts that they might harm their baby. Have any such thoughts occurred to you?&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Have you had any scary thoughts, for example, that you might accidentally harm the baby? Many women experience such thoughts, but are afraid to mention them.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who screen positive should receive a thorough psychiatric assessment that includes a diagnostic evaluation based on DSM-5 criteria for OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]and considers possible alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H718079259\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In evaluating the patients&rsquo; mental status, it is important to distinguish the obsessional thoughts of OCD from psychotic thoughts or ideas. The interviewer should explore whether the patient has insight into the false ideas and related behaviors (obsessions and compulsions) or if she believes they are real (psychosis). Particularly when the patient lacks insight into his or her illness, assessment should rule out the presence of accompanying psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations) that are characteristic of a psychotic disorder rather than OCD.</p><p>Patients should be asked if they have intent or desire to harm the baby, others, or themselves. Patients should be evaluated for comorbid disorders, including depression and generalized anxiety disorder.</p><p>Whenever possible, assessment for OCD should include secondary sources of information, such as the patient's partner or a close family member. Women with OCD are often secretive about their symptoms and may be reluctant to disclose them to a clinician due to stigma, shame, or fear that disclosure would lead to the baby being taken away. We have observed that the symptoms may come to clinical attention only when the partner or other family caregiver has to return to work and is concerned about the mother's ability to care for the child on her own.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H718079259\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a challenging disorder to treat; only 20 percent of patients are estimated to achieve a full remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Treatment of the illness in pregnant and postpartum women can be more complex, with additional risk factors to consider and little data available to inform treatment. A 2016 systematic review of clinical management of perinatal anxiety disorders concluded that the evidence base for treating OCD was lacking and based mainly on very small studies or on case reports, but concluded that either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) could be considered reasonable first-line treatment options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Some general principles to guide treatment are as follows:</p><p>When the patient's illness is accompanied by factors suggesting a risk of harm to mother or baby (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk of harm'</a> above), safety should be the foremost consideration. Interventions should be based on the likelihood of harm. In lower-risk situations, outpatient interventions may be sufficient, such as a partner or family members who will provide support, child care, and ensure the patient is not alone with the baby. In higher-risk circumstances, the mother may require hospitalization and intervention by the state department of child protective services may be required for the baby. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-social-and-medicolegal-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When multiple clinicians are treating a pregnant or postpartum woman with OCD (eg, an obstetrician or primary care clinician and a mental health specialist), communication among providers is important. Patients can be selective in revealing information related to safety, treatment compliance, or changes in severity of illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications shown to be effective for treatment of OCD in the general population include the serotonergic antidepressants and, for refractory cases, augmentation with atypical antipsychotic medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Deciding whether or not to prescribe one of these medications for a pregnant or nursing woman should be based, as it is for all patients, on a careful weighing of the benefits and risks of treatment, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity and chronicity of the obsessions and compulsions, and the degree to which they impair patient and family functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks that untreated illness present to the mother and baby (eg, avoidance, neglect, suicidality, or homicidality).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks the medications present to the baby through exposure either in utero or during breast feeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of infant exposure to antidepressants and benzodiazepines through breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe antenatal unipolar major depression: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Decision-making is made more difficult by the paucity of research on the efficacy and adverse effects of medications. Thus, the physician may want to emphasize educating the patient and partner about risks and benefits and helping them come to an informed decision. Patient preferences can vary widely and similar patients may make very different decisions.</p><p>The efficacy of medications for OCD in pregnant or postpartum women has not been tested in randomized trials. There are no published studies of any type for the serotonergic antidepressants in this population. A single uncontrolled study examined <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> augmentation following an inadequate response to an SSRI in 17 postpartum women with OCD. After 12 weeks of treatment, 11 of the 17 women experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>When comorbid postpartum depression and OCD are treated with medication, first-line treatment is a serotonergic antidepressant, which can be effective for both disorders. Treatment should aimed at remission of both OCD and depression. At the start of treatment with these medications, a benzodiazepine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> can be used to treat the anxiety and insomnia that may accompany the disorder or develop secondary to the medication.

Filial therapy trains the mother through instruction, demonstration play, and supervision to create positive interactions with the baby, recognizing and responding to his or her emotions in an accepting environment. Symptoms suggesting the possible utility of this approach include the mother avoiding the infant, being intrusive, or being excessively clingy. Although evaluated for numerous populations, filial therapy has not been studied specifically for OCD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2701186740\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
