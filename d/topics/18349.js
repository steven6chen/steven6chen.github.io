This may adversely affect urinary continence and quality of life, and can also lead to progressive deterioration of the upper urinary tract and chronic renal disease. Thirty to 40 percent of children with myelomeningocele develop some degree of renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Treatment to reduce bladder pressures and minimize urine stasis often prevents or attenuates this complication.</p><p>The assessment and management of the urinary tract complications of spina bifida are discussed here. Other aspects of myelomeningocele are discussed separately.

As an example, patients with very &quot;low&quot; level (sacral) myelomeningocele may have unfavorable bladder dynamics even if lower extremity function is normal. Therefore, all patients with spina bifida, including those that ambulate, should be evaluated periodically with ultrasonography and urodynamic studies, as described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-clinical-features-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Normal voiding'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with myelomeningocele also have increased risk for developing kidney stones. In one study, the prevalence of kidney stones was 4 percent among children with spinal dysraphism, compared with 0.2 percent in healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For these patients, an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder should be performed shortly after birth. This study detects the presence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter, and assesses bladder wall thickness and distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

Urinary tract changes may occur for any of the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder function may change within the first few months of life, probably because of healing after the initial spine closure at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The capacity of a neurogenic bladder may not grow as the child grows, as normal bladders do.

The findings of hydronephrosis, hydroureter, abnormal bladder wall thickness, or excessive post-void residual volume suggest abnormal voiding mechanics and a risk for chronic renal disease. The study should then be repeated every three months in the first year of life, every six months in the second year, and then every year thereafter. The ultrasound should be performed more frequently if clinical symptoms such as urinary tract infection (UTI) occur, the patient undergoes other neurosurgical or spinal surgery (eg, tethered cord release or spinal fusion), non-compliance with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is suspected, or in the setting of a particularly high risk bladder. Some practices begin to see patients every six months again in adolescence as it is a high risk time for noncompliance.

Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is recommended for all patients with neurogenic bladder. Anticholinergic agents are added for patients with high pressure bladders or hyperreflexic bladders. For patients with vesicoureteral reflux, anticholinergics are also used, and in some cases prophylactic antibiotics are added.</p><p>A variety of surgical approaches may be helpful for patients who fail medical treatment for neurogenic bladder, or to facilitate self-management and continence (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clean intermittent catheterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend early initiation of CIC (ie, shortly after birth) for all infants with neurogenic bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The goal of CIC is to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) and overdistension of the bladder, which can lead to hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux and chronic renal disease.</p><p>There are several important reasons for early initiation of CIC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early initiation of CIC may improve outcomes as compared with later initiation of CIC. In a case series reporting outcomes after at least 11 years of CIC, initiating CIC early (&lt;1 year old) was associated with less deterioration of the urinary tract as compared with late treatment initiation (&gt;3 years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other observational studies suggest similar benefits from early initiation of CIC, and some suggest that there is additional advantage to initiating treatment during the first three months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Consistent use of CIC regimens has reduced the need for bladder augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most affected individuals will eventually require CIC to attain continence or protect the kidneys, and it is easier to start a CIC program in infancy. Children who were started on CIC as infants appear to tolerate and be more compliant with the CIC than children who begin at a later age. It is more difficult to start a CIC program on a five year old than a child that has previously been catheterized. Most children can perform CIC independently by five years of age if initiated during infancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean intermittent self-catheterization has very few complications. In a study of 31 females followed to 10 to 19 years of CIC (with or without anticholinergic treatment), only minor complications were seen. These were least likely to occur when catheters size 12 French or larger were used, and when self-catheterization was performed instead of assisted catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Complication rates were also low in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Some patients will continue to have urinary tract deterioration despite an optimal regimen of CIC and anticholinergic medications. In this case, nocturnal bladder emptying can be helpful. This is achieved by using a continuously draining catheter during sleep or through scheduled nighttime CIC. Among 19 children treated with nocturnal bladder emptying, 15 had clinical benefit (decrease in hydronephrosis, fewer UTIs, increase in bladder capacity, or improved urinary continence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. If nocturnal bladder emptying is unsuccessful, augmentation cystoplasty may be needed in order to achieve continence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> preserve renal function. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Bladder augmentation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticholinergics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticholinergic medication is appropriate for patients with myelomeningocele who have high pressure bladders, hyperreflexic bladders, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). In these patients, VUR is secondary in nature, because it is caused by the intravesicular pressure of the neurogenic bladder. The management of secondary VUR differs from that of primary VUR, which occurs in a patient without neurogenic bladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and course of primary vesicoureteral reflux&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with secondary VUR should be treated with an anticholinergic agent to lower filling pressures, CIC to prevent overfill, and, in some cases, prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21</a>]. The efficacy of this regimen was demonstrated in a sequential nonrandomized study, in which patients with neurogenic bladder were treated with clean intermittent catheterization and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxybutynin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. During five years of follow-up, the upper urinary tract deteriorated less often in the treated group as compared with historical controls (8 versus 48 percent). Similar results were noted in a case series of 144 children with myelomeningocele, in which only 3 percent of children treated with early initiation of CIC and anticholinergics had renal scarring or partial loss of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This compares favorably to the high rates of renal parenchymal damage reported in older series in which children were managed less aggressively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In one such series, 13 percent of children developed cortical damage by age two and 27 percent by age 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of note, in the case series of 144 children described above, delays in initiating a regimen of CIC and anticholinergic therapy (eg, due to unrecognized spina bifida) were associated with higher rates of renal scarring.</p><p>For an anticholinergic agent, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxybutynin</a> at the following doses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants &lt;12 months of age, 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally three times a day (available as Ditropan syrup, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children one to five years of age, 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose three times a day (or 1 mg per year of age per dose).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children &ge;5 years old, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxybutynin</a> tablets (Ditropan), 5 mg orally three times a day.</p><p/><p>For children &ge;5 years old, the extended release preparation (Ditropan XL) may be used, beginning with 5 mg daily and titrated to effect (to a maximum dose of 20 mg daily).

The disadvantages of botulinum toxin treatment are that it requires a general anesthetic in children and treatments must be repeated to maintain response. In one study, the mean duration of response was 15 months (range 3 to 42 months), and patients with poorly compliant bladders had no response or a short duration of response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, botulinum toxin treatment may be a reasonable alternative to bladder augmentation, especially for patients with more compliant bladders. It can also be useful in the situation where there is a very young, small, or fragile child who has a very high pressure bladder but would not tolerate the invasive augmentation surgery.

Most patients have bacterial colonization of the urinary tract and abnormalities are often found on urinalysis and urine culture. Approximately 70 percent of patients performing CIC have bacteriuria, but most are asymptomatic and do not require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Urinalysis and urine culture should only be performed, and positive results subsequently treated, in <strong>symptomatic</strong> patients. Simple cloudy or smelly urine can usually be treated with increasing fluids and increasing the interval of CIC to every one to two hours for 12 hours.</p><p>Symptoms suggesting UTI include pain with CIC, gross hematuria, back or abdominal pain, lethargy, fever, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting.

Bladder augmentation also may be beneficial for patients with severe incontinence that is refractory to medical management. Both enteric bladder augmentation and bladder auto-augmentation have been used in this setting; however, there is greater experience with enteric bladder augmentation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enteric bladder augmentation</strong> &ndash; Enteric bladder augmentation, also known as enterocystoplasty, is a procedure in which a detubularized segment of intestine (usually ileum) is added to the bladder to increase capacity and lower pressure. In the past, gastric segments were used. However, these gastric-derived patches tended to cause problems with the gastric acid secretion (hematuria and dysuria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential complications and consequences of enteric bladder augmentation include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic consequences &ndash; Incorporating functional enteric epithelium into the urinary tract may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The frequency and severity of this complication are related to the length and type of bowel used for the augmentation, the urinary dwell time, and the patient's renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. For children who have undergone ileal augmentation, the metabolic acidosis is usually not of clinical significance. Theoretically, metabolic acidosis could lead to poor renal calcium reabsorption, which might impact bone health. However, based on data from several large series, enteric bladder augmentation does not appear to affect bone density or linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vitamin B12 deficiency &ndash; Patients who have undergone enteric bladder augmentation surgery have an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thus, for patients who are &ge;5 years beyond bladder augmentation, we suggest laboratory evaluation with hemoglobin level and, if anemia is detected, measurement of B12 levels.

The problem is likely due to excessive mucus in the urine, chronic bacterial colonization, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> underlying metabolic abnormalities. Routine bladder irrigations can help clear excessive mucous and may prevent bladder calculi; however, patients who have developed a bladder stone tend to have recurrences even with routine irrigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other complications &ndash; Other complications include small bowel obstruction, fecal incontinence, bladder rupture, and renal calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Risk of malignancy &ndash; There have been a few documented cases of cancer in the augmented bladder, occurring many years after the surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, it is uncertain whether routine cancer surveillance (eg, with annual cystoscopy) is warranted in these patients given the low incidence of malignancy and unproven benefit of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In our practice, we begin surveillance 10 years after bladder augmentation. Surveillance consists of an annual abdominal ultrasound and basic metabolic, renal, and hematologic laboratory tests, without routine surveillance cystoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder auto-augmentation</strong> &ndash; Another approach to bladder augmentation that has been attempted is a bladder auto-augmentation, where part of the musculature of the bladder wall is removed. Case series of auto-augmentation in this patient population have reported contradictory results. One series reported good long-term outcomes, with improvements in vesicoureteral reflux and continence in most patients (median follow up of 6.8 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. By contrast, another series with similar length of follow up described ongoing incontinence and deterioration of the upper urinary tract in most patients undergoing the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It is possible that individual patient characteristics, such as a higher baseline bladder capacity, predict better outcomes of auto-augmentation. Auto-augmentation may delay the need for intestinal augmentation for many years, thereby preventing short term complications of intestinal augmentation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder neck/outlet surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the bladder outlet is weak, <span class=\"nowrap\">outlet/bladder</span> neck surgery can be performed to add resistance and gain urinary continence. There are various types of bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">neck/outlet</span> surgery, including endoscopic bulking agents, artificial urinary sphincters and bladder neck slings, and the choice depends on individual characteristics (particularly sex) of the patient. Most surgeons begin with endoscopic bulking agents for less severe incontinence followed by bladder neck sling in females because of the long-term negative sequela associated with artificial urinary sphincters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Continent catheterizable stoma surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient who is unable to catheterize their own urethra may benefit from a continent abdominal catheterizable channel such as an appendicovesicostomy (Mitrofanoff) or ileovesicostomy (Monti). The channel is constructed between the bladder and the skin utilizing appendix or bowel with the stoma placed at the level of the umbilicus or on the lower abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. This location is more accessible than the urethra, and reduces the time required for clean intermittent catheterization, especially in females with lesions at the thoracic level. The most common complication is stenosis or leaking of the stoma at the skin which may require dilation or surgical revision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3076156178\"><span class=\"h2\">Ureteral reimplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This procedure is rarely necessary. It is occasionally used in selected patients with persistent reflux and upper tract deterioration, or in those with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) despite an optimal regimen of clean intermittent catheterization, anticholinergics, and prophylactic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Ureteral implantation should be considered cautiously for patients with neurogenic bladder. In these patients, the reflux is often caused by increased bladder pressures rather than by incompetent or inadequate closure of the ureterovesical junction. It is important to optimize medical treatment for the neurogenic bladder before considering ureteral reimplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4169186050\"><span class=\"h2\">Vesicostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vesicostomy is an incontinent diversion of the bladder to the lower abdominal wall. Vesicostomy is rarely indicated in this patient population. This procedure is performed for bladder drainage in infants with high bladder pressure who have failed a regimen of clean intermittent catheterization and anticholinergic medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The failure may be caused by poor adherence to the medical regimen, or by a particularly small bladder capacity. Vesicostomy is usually used for temporary diversion until the patient or family is able to adhere to the regimen, or until the child is old enough to undergo bladder augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurosurgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an affected individual develops a tethered spinal cord, then neurosurgical intervention is warranted to preserve baseline urologic function and prevent further neurological deterioration.

Based on the available evidence, the Xiao procedure is <strong>not</strong> recommended. The lumbar sacral nerve re-routing procedure is a surgical technique in which the neurologic defect is bypassed by creating a microanastomosis of the fifth lumbar ventral root to the third sacral ventral root. The initial report of this procedure in 20 children with myelomeningocele suggested that it improved or restored bladder control in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A subsequent pilot study of the Xiao procedure in 13 patients treated in the United States demonstrated some transient improvement, albeit less impressive than the original report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In addition, there were reports of complications, such as foot drop. In a randomized controlled trial in 20 children with myelomeningocele or lipomyelomeningocele, the Xiao procedure did not result in voluntary voiding or continence in any patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With good urologic management, preservation of renal function and, if desired, urinary continence prior to school entry are attainable goals.</p><p>Most patients with myelomeningocele will not be able to void normally, and will require lifelong treatment with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), medication, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery to be continent of urine and to protect the upper urinary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Thirty to 40 percent of children with myelomeningocele develop some degree of renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
