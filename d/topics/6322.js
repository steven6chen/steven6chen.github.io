In the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, the new viruses contained components of previous human, as well as avian, influenza viruses. The origin of the influenza virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic, which killed more people in a single year than the bubonic plague, remains uncertain, but it appears to have been an adapted avian influenza strain. The emergence of a novel H1N1 human-swine-avian reassortant virus in 2009 in North America started a new pandemic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 850 clinical cases of H5N1 influenza infection have been reported in humans since 2003, although the actual number of infections transmitted from birds to humans may be considerably higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. Two features of recent avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks are striking: the predominance of children and young adults and the high mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, seroprevalence studies have found that some exposed individuals may have had a subclinical or mild infection, suggesting that the reported case-fatality rate may be an overestimate. (See <a href=\"#H6026594\" class=\"local\">'Subclinical and mild infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses now appear to be endemic among bird and poultry populations in Eurasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sporadic transmission to humans raises concern that the H5N1 virus may mutate or combine with genetic material from coinfecting human influenza viruses to generate a novel strain capable of sustained human-to-human transmission with pandemic potential. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the potential threat from H5N1 as a &quot;public health crisis.&quot;</p><p>The epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of avian influenza will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of avian influenza are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of avian influenza&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of avian influenza&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avian-influenza-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Avian influenza vaccines&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus is also reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Avian influenza A H7N9: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza viruses are enveloped RNA viruses that have a segmented genome and display great antigenic diversity. Influenza A and B viruses have two major antigenic surface glycoproteins embedded into the membrane, the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) that induce antibody responses in humans. Influenza virus strains are classified by their core proteins (ie, A, B, or C), species of origin (eg, avian, swine), geographic site of isolation, serial number, and, for influenza A, by subtypes of HA and NA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Influenza A is responsible for frequent, usually annual, outbreaks or epidemics of varying intensity and occasional pandemics, whereas influenza B causes outbreaks every two to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although 16 HA (H1-H16) and nine NA (N1-N9) virus subtypes occur in their natural reservoir of aquatic birds, only three hemagglutinin subtypes have caused widespread human respiratory infection (H1, H2, and H3), suggesting a degree of host specificity. The H1N1 influenza virus that caused the 2009 pandemic represented a quadruple reassortment of two swine strains, one human strain, and one avian strain of influenza. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;, section on 'Genetic and antigenic characterization'</a>.)</p><p>Human influenza H1 and H3 subtypes currently circulating continuously undergo variability or &quot;antigenic drift.&quot; Inefficient proofreading by influenza viral RNA polymerase results in a high incidence of transcription errors and amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, allowing new variants to evade preexisting humoral immunity and cause interpandemic outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;, section on 'Antigenic drifts'</a>.)</p><p>Simultaneous infection of a cell by two influenza viruses (eg, an H5N1 influenza and an H3N2 or H1N1 influenza virus) may allow recombination of RNA segments and result in the generation of a new &quot;reassorted&quot; virus with novel surface proteins to which there is little population immunity. Pandemic influenza viruses may arise by this process in what is called &quot;antigenic shift.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;, section on 'Antigenic shifts'</a>.)</p><p>Another concern is that mutations could occur spontaneously in an H5N1 influenza virus (in the absence of reassortment with another influenza virus) that could allow airborne transmission to humans. (See <a href=\"#H248870971\" class=\"local\">'Transmissible experimental avian influenza'</a> below.)</p><p>There have been five influenza pandemics during the past century, two of which were caused by human-avian reassortant viruses (H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 1968) and one of which was caused by a quadruple reassortment of two swine strains, one human strain, and one avian strain (H1N1 in 2009 to 2010) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;, section on 'Genetic and antigenic characterization'</a>). It has been proposed that genetic reassortment between avian and human viruses leading to new viruses capable of pandemic spread may occur in coinfected persons or intermediate hosts, such as pigs or birds, although the circumstances under which this occurs remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic remains the greatest outbreak of infectious disease in history. It appears that the H1N1 virus responsible was derived from an avian strain that adapted to infect and efficiently transmit between humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This raises concerns that avian H5N1 influenza could repeat the adaptation.</p><p>Pigs may play an important role in the evolution of human pandemic strains. Pig tracheal epithelial cells contain receptors for both avian and human influenza viruses and the domestic pig supports the growth of viruses of both human and avian origin. Thus, it has been proposed that genetic reassortment between avian and human virus may occur in pigs, leading to a novel strain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;, section on 'Role of pigs'</a>.)</p><p>Newly shifted strains typically emerge in Southeast Asia, where agricultural practices and the close proximity of humans, birds, and swine facilitate virus reassortment, although the emergence of pandemic H1N1 influenza in North America in 2009 has demonstrated the variable nature of influenza viruses and the need for virologic surveillance and vigilance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although avian influenza viruses generally replicate inefficiently in humans, some subtypes of avian influenza can replicate within the human respiratory tract and cause disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Avian influenza H5N1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses are endemic among bird and poultry populations in Asian countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The first association of avian influenza H5N1 with clinical respiratory disease occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when 18 human cases occurred during a poultry outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in live-bird markets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. This outbreak was associated with a high mortality rate (33 percent), a high incidence of pneumonia (61 percent), and a high rate of intensive care (51 percent). All virus genes were of avian origin, suggesting that H5N1 had jumped the species barrier without adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Serologic surveillance revealed little evidence of human-to-human transmission, and no further cases were reported following mass culling of poultry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>].</p><p>In 2003, H5N1 reemerged in humans when two culture-confirmed cases occurred in a family group returning to Hong Kong from China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A younger family member also died of a respiratory illness, but the etiology was undetermined. Since late 2003, highly pathogenic H5N1 has caused extensive and unprecedented outbreaks among poultry across Eurasia and appears to have become established as an endemic virus in poultry and ducks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Between April and August 2005, poultry outbreaks of H5N1 in western China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russia were associated with deaths of wild waterbirds in local lakes. Molecular analysis of H5N1 isolates from Russian outbreaks revealed antigenic similarity to viruses isolated in China, leading to concerns that migratory birds are capable of spreading avian influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Further evidence for this route of spread came in October 2005, when large outbreaks of H5N1 affected poultry in eastern Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Despite culling of domestic and agricultural flocks, outbreaks in multiple provinces were reported. The first fatal human cases outside southeastern Asia were detected among Turkish poultry farmers and in young children with poultry exposure in early 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Since February 2006, rapid geographic spread of H5N1 virus in wild and domestic birds has been reported in such countries as Iraq, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Iran, Austria, Germany, Egypt, India, France, and Israel. Of particular note, the virus has been isolated in migratory wild birds, and concurrent poultry farm outbreaks in several European Union countries suggest multiple introductions. H5 viruses, including H5N1, were detected in wild and domestic birds in the United States and Canada in late 2014 and 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p>Since 2003, more than 850 human cases have been reported to the WHO with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of approximately 53 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, seroprevalence studies have found that some exposed individuals may have had a subclinical or mild infection, suggesting that the reported CFR may be an overestimate (see <a href=\"#H6026594\" class=\"local\">'Subclinical and mild infections'</a> below). In a study of H5N1 infections in children, the CFR was 49 percent overall but varied by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Children aged 0 to 5 years had a case-fatality rate of 28 percent, compared with 52 percent for children between 6 and 11 years and 80 percent for children between 12 and 17 years.</p><p>Human H5N1 infections have been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Canada, China, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/28,33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33-39</a>]. A fatal case of H5N1 infection was reported in a woman in Canada in January 2014, following her return from a trip to Beijing, China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This is the first reported case in North America. However, the largest number of monthly reported human cases to date began in Egypt in November 2014 and continued into 2015 with 136 cases and 39 deaths reported between January and November 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. These occurred in association with extensive household and farm poultry infections in Egypt with all reported human cases having some exposure to live birds and no evidence of human-to-human transmission or H5N1 virus adaptations. Outbreak control has been achieved by enhanced virologic surveillance and mass slaughter of affected poultry, with only infrequent sporadic human cases reported since June 2015.</p><p>Since its emergence in humans in 1997, influenza H5N1 has undergone antigenic changes (eg, antigenic drift) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Sequencing and antigenic characterization of the hemagglutinin genes in circulating H5N1 viruses reveal significant antigenic differences between those isolated from humans in 1997 and in the subsequent years of 2003 through 2010.</p><p>The clade 1 viruses caused disease in humans in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam in 2004 and 2005, in Thailand in 2006, and continue to circulate among poultry in Cambodia, with sporadic human infections in Vietnam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/39,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,45</a>]. Clade 2 viruses have been circulating in birds in China and Indonesia since 2003 and spread during 2005 and 2006 to the Middle East, Europe, and Africa; this clade began causing human infections in late 2005 and continued into 2010, principally in Egypt and Indonesia. Clade 2 has been further divided into three subclades, which differ in their geographical distribution, and have all been implicated in human infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/22,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,45</a>]. A novel cluster of clade 2 H5N1 viruses (clade 2.2.1.2) possessing specific neuraminidase mutations emerged in poultry in Egypt in the summer of 2014 and rapidly became the predominant virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The emergence of these viruses coincided with an increase in human cases in Egypt, as described above. Sequences isolated from two human cases in Egypt during the same time period had similar mutations and were part of the same phylogenetic group.</p><p>A phylogenetic analysis suggests that the various clades of influenza H5N1 that have infected humans derive from a common source in southern China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Continuing surveillance of virus isolates among poultry, birds, and humans by the WHO is important so that newly emerging antigenically distinct viruses can be assessed for use in candidate vaccines in a timely fashion.</p><p>In an analysis of a registry of 215 patients from 10 countries who had H5N1 influenza infection and were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>, the mortality rate varied depending upon the infecting clade; patients infected with a clade 2.1 virus had a significantly higher risk of dying than patients who were infected with clade 1, clade 2.2, or clade 2.3 viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>In addition to infecting poultry and humans, H5N1 virus appears to have extended its host range into felids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. During the 2003 to 2005 H5N1 outbreaks, there have been reports of fatal infection in domestic cats, a finding that has been confirmed after experimental inoculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Infection can be acquired horizontally from other cats or by feeding on infected poultry or wild birds. Furthermore, H5N1 virus caused severe pneumonia in tigers and leopards at the Bangkok zoo, which fed on infected poultry carcasses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Several domestic cats and a stone marten died of avian H5N1 during an outbreak of lethal avian H5N1 among swans on a nature reserve in Germany; it is presumed that they fed on the dead birds. There are no reports of cats transmitting the virus to humans. A case of fatal avian H5N1 influenza has also been reported in a dog [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6026594\"><span class=\"h3\">Subclinical and mild infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important question is whether cases of H5N1 influenza have gone undetected, given the fact that most known cases have occurred in rural areas with limited access to healthcare providers. A 2012 meta-analysis of published studies evaluated serologic evidence of H5N1 influenza infection in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Study participants with confirmed H5N1 influenza infection (as defined by the WHO) were excluded from the analysis in order to assess the rate of seropositivity in individuals without documented infection. Most participants reported no recent respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> febrile illnesses. The primary analysis included 7304 individuals from 19 studies to which the WHO modified guidelines for seropositivity could be applied. The overall rate of seropositivity was 1.2 percent (95% CI 0.6-2.1 percent). In a secondary analysis of 6774 individuals from 10 studies that could not be interpreted using the WHO modified guidelines for seropositivity, the overall rate of seropositivity was 1.9 percent (95% CI 0.5-3.4 percent). In a subgroup analysis of 2729 poultry workers, the seropositivity rate was 1.2 percent. Similarly, in a prospective seroepidemiologic study that enrolled 750 poultry-exposed and 250 unexposed individuals in Egypt, 2 percent of exposed individuals had anti-H5N1 antibodies compared with none in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. These results indicate that subclinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild infections occur, albeit infrequently, suggesting that the very high case-fatality rate that has been reported with H5N1 influenza may be an overestimate.</p><p>A 2013 review of 29 published studies also found a low prevalence of antibodies to clades or genotypes of H5N1 influenza that are currently circulating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, the authors noted that the available studies are not capable of establishing the true prevalence or severity of human H5N1 influenza infections because none were designed to determine the prevalence of H5N1 infections in the general population, most did not include unexposed control groups, and many used antibody titer thresholds or methodologies that increase the likelihood of false-positive results due to cross-reaction with other influenza viruses.</p><p>In a seroprevalence study performed in a region of rural Thailand that had previously been affected by avian influenza H5N1, independent risk factors for having avian influenza H5N1 antibodies included increasing age, lack of an indoor water source, and chronic breathing problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Surprisingly, poultry exposure was not associated with the presence of H5N1 influenza antibodies.</p><p>In a study of a cohort in Vietnam that was considered to be at high risk for H5N1 influenza infection, 24 of 747 individuals (3.2 percent) demonstrated H5-specific T cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The strain specificity of T cell responses is unclear, but this reactivity may indicate that more cases of subclinical infection have occurred than had previously been appreciated.</p><p>However, in a seroprevalence study among 101 poultry market workers in East Java, Indonesia, conducted in 2014, 84 percent tested positive for antibodies to avian H5 influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Furthermore, 11 of 25 individuals (44 percent) who had had serum samples taken two years earlier were found to have seroconverted. No individuals could recall having had a severe acute respiratory illness, suggesting a higher prevalence of asymptomatic infection than previously recognized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H668102425\"><span class=\"h2\">Avian influenza H5N6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avian influenza H5N6 viruses have been isolated from several individuals in China since 2014 presenting with a spectrum of disease ranging from mild self-limiting respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Avian influenza H9N2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Hong Kong in 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2009, influenza H9N2 viruses were isolated mainly from children with mild, self-limited respiratory infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/27,45,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,45,64,65</a>]. In a serologic study, 99 of 2191 poultry workers in China (4.5 percent) had anti-H9 antibodies, suggesting that subclinical infection occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The highest rate of seropositivity was observed in poultry retailers in food markets (16 percent), suggesting that direct contact with live birds <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> slaughtering poultry may be risk factors for acquisition. In a seroepidemiologic study in Egypt, the prevalence of anti-H9N2 antibodies was between 5.6 and 7.5 percent in poultry-exposed humans following detection of H9N2 viruses in poultry; before H9N2 viruses were circulating in poultry, anti-H9N2 antibodies were not detected in poultry-exposed humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The H9N2 viruses responsible for the 1999 human infections contained internal genes homologous to those of the 1997 H5N1 viruses, suggesting that reassortment had occurred between these strains.

In response, a United States government advisory panel, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), initially asked the journals considering publishing these data, <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature</em>, to withhold details that would allow replication of the experiments because of concerns about this information being used for bioterrorism.

They then fused the mutant HA gene to seven others from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain of influenza and inoculated ferrets with the hybrid virus; like humans, ferrets have alpha 2-6 galactose receptors in the epithelial cells of their upper respiratory tracts. One ferret developed higher concentrations of virus than the others, and this animal was found to be infected with a virus that had an additional HA mutation. This additional HA mutation improved transmission of the virus among ferrets. However, this virus spread more slowly and caused less damage in the lungs than the 2009 to 2010 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and did not result in any fatal infections.</p><p>In the second study, an H5N1 influenza virus was modified by site-directed mutagenesis followed by serial passage in ferrets, which resulted in a virus isolate that became transmissible in ferrets via airborne spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. First, two mutations were introduced into the HA gene to switch the receptor specificity from alpha 2-3 galactose to alpha 2-6 galactose to enable the virus to bind to the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract of ferrets (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Tissue tropism'</a> below). Next, a mutation was introduced in the gene encoding the polymerase complex protein, basic polymerase 2, to enable the virus to replicate at 33&deg;C (the temperature of the mammalian upper respiratory tract) rather than 41&deg;C (the temperature of the intestinal tracts of birds). Because the resulting virus was not transmissible among ferrets, it was serially passaged through ferrets ten times, which resulted in additional mutations and airborne transmission among ferrets. The viruses isolated from the six ferrets that were infected by airborne transmission still harbored the three mutations that were introduced by experimental site-directed mutagenesis. Two additional amino acid substitutions in the HA protein were detected in all six transmissible viruses. None of the ferrets died following infection with this isolate. This study demonstrates that H5N1 influenza viruses can acquire the capacity for airborne transmission between certain mammals without recombination in an intermediate host. These results raise the possibility that a strain of H5N1 influenza virus transmissible among mammals could emerge spontaneously by reassortment mechanisms.</p><p>Another study evaluated the potential for an H5N1 influenza virus that would be transmissible via respiratory droplets in humans to evolve naturally in a mammalian host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Using surveillance data of H5N1 viruses that have infected humans, H5N1 influenza viruses were found that have been only three or four mutations away from the transmissible viruses described in the studies above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/10,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,120</a>]. Mathematical modeling was used to evaluate factors that could increase or decrease the probability of the remaining substitutions evolving after the virus has infected a mammalian host, although precise estimates of the probability of evolving the remaining mutations could not be accurately calculated. Nevertheless, the researchers hypothesized that these mutations could evolve within a single mammalian host. However, the precise molecular determinants and gene constellations that confer transmissibility and virulence of avian, human, and swine influenza viruses, and the natural circumstances under which new phenotypes emerge, remain unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both H5 and H7 subtypes possess the ability to evolve into highly pathogenic virus strains.

In pig respiratory epithelial cells, for example, the 1997 H5N1 human viruses were relatively resistant to the inhibitory effects of host antiviral cytokines.

Following a lethal challenge with an H5N1 virus, mutant mice lacking both TNF and interleukin-1 receptors had diminished cytokine production in lung tissue, a reduction in the number of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs, as well as reduced morbidity and a significant delay in mortality compared with wild-type mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. In contrast, no differences in morbidity or mortality were observed between mutant and wild-type mice infected with an H1N1 virus.

H5N1 strains possessing mutations that enable them to bind to alpha 2-6 galactose receptors in the upper respiratory tract have been isolated rarely from humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/135,136\" class=\"abstract_t\">135,136</a>].</p><p>In animal models of H5N1 infection, including cats, ferrets, and mice, extensive extra-respiratory spread of H5N1 has been found in nervous, urinary, gastrointestinal, and lymphoid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/137,138\" class=\"abstract_t\">137,138</a>]. The extensive systemic viral replication and inflammation suggest that the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus may be related to this wider tissue tropism in these animals. The detection of H5N1 in digestive tracts of mammals raises the possibility of fecal-oral mechanisms of transmission.</p><p>Among naturally infected humans and experimentally infected primates, the predominant features are respiratory disease with little evidence of extra-respiratory tissue tropism of H5N1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/139-141\" class=\"abstract_t\">139-141</a>]. However, there is some evidence of extra-respiratory disease in humans. As an example, H5N1 was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and rectal swab specimens in a patient with encephalopathy and diarrhea, indicating that extra-respiratory infection can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In addition, viral genomic sequences and antigens have been isolated from tracheal epithelial cells, lymph node T cells, and neurons, as well as the lower respiratory tract; and viral genomic sequences have been detected in the intestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, one group has detected alpha 2-3 galactose receptors in the human gastrointestinal tract and was able to infect this tissue ex vivo, resulting in production of infectious virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. In the same study, a colonic sample obtained at autopsy from an individual infected with H5N1 showed evidence of viral antigen expression in epithelial cells.</p><p>Experimental H5N1 viruses that are transmissible in ferrets are discussed above; like humans, ferrets have alpha 2-6 galactose receptors in the epithelial cells of their upper respiratory tracts and are therefore considered an excellent model for H5N1 influenza infections in humans. (See <a href=\"#H248870971\" class=\"local\">'Transmissible experimental avian influenza'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Two features of recent avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks are striking: the predominance of children and young adults and the high mortality rate. However, seroprevalence studies have found that some exposed individuals may have had a subclinical or mild infection, suggesting that the reported case-fatality rate may be an overestimate. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses are endemic among bird and poultry populations in Eurasia. Sporadic transmission to humans raises concern that the H5N1 virus may mutate or combine with genetic material from coinfecting human influenza viruses to generate a novel strain capable of sustained human-to-human transmission with pandemic potential. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Avian influenza H5N1'</a> above and <a href=\"#H248870971\" class=\"local\">'Transmissible experimental avian influenza'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza H9N2 viruses have been isolated from children with mild, self-limited respiratory infection, and seropositivity has been documented in asymptomatic poultry workers, suggesting that subclinical infection occurs. Influenza H7 viruses have rarely caused conjunctivitis and respiratory infections in poultry workers during outbreaks of disease in poultry. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Avian influenza H9N2'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Avian influenza H7'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In late March and early April 2013, severe human cases (including fatal cases) of novel H7N9 infection in China were reported to the World Health Organization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avian-influenza-a-h7n9-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Avian influenza A H7N9: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For human influenza A (H5N1) infections, bird-to-human is the predominant route of transmission; limited, nonsustained human-to-human transmission has also occurred, and environment-to-human spread is thought to be possible. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human influenza viruses preferentially bind to host cells via hemagglutinin (HA) by attaching to sialic acid molecules containing alpha 2-6 galactose receptors that are found on epithelial cells of the human upper respiratory tract. Avian influenza viruses, including H5N1, prefer sialic acid molecules containing alpha 2-3 galactose receptors, which are common in the respiratory tracts of birds but have also been demonstrated throughout the human respiratory tract, particularly in alveoli and distal airways. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The host immune response to H5N1 may contribute to the pathogenesis and expression of clinical disease. The 2003 H5N1 human cases had unusually high serum concentrations of various chemokines, suggesting that the severity of human H5N1 infection may be related to the induction of excessive proinflammatory responses that exacerbate tissue injury.
