Compared with standard hemodialysis, HDF removes more middle-molecular-weight solutes. Some, though not all, studies have suggested that HDF is associated with improved clinical outcomes, providing adequate convection volumes are achieved.</p><p>However, HDF is more complex than standard hemodialysis and places increased demands on the user and outpatient dialysis center. HDF is available in the United States but not commonly used. In Europe, Japan, and some other countries where HDF is commonly used, most clinicians use a specific type of HDF termed online HDF. In online HDF, the substitution fluid is produced by the dialysis machine, which enables large convection volumes.</p><p>This topic reviews the technical aspects of HDF. Dosing recommendations and clinical outcomes for HDF are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intermittent high-volume hemodiafiltration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110984150\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3382882176\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional hemodialysis clears uremic toxins mostly by diffusion driven by the thermal energy of the uremic toxin molecule. Clearance of the toxin by diffusion is inversely proportional to the radius of the toxin molecule. As a result, conventional hemodialysis clears larger toxin molecules less effectively than smaller ones. Clearance of larger toxins is limited by their low rate of diffusion, even if they can easily pass through the pores in the dialyzer membrane.</p><p>In contrast, hemodiafiltration (HDF) increases the clearance of larger toxins by large-volume ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration carries toxins through the membrane pores by fluid flow, also known as convection. As long as the toxin molecule can easily pass through the membrane pores, the rate of transfer is independent of the molecule size.</p><p>HDF requires the infusion of significant amounts (at least 15 to 20 and up to 150 L) of infusate to replace the ultrafiltrate. This infusate fluid must be sterile and pyrogen free since it is infused directly into the blood. In addition, the rate of infusion must be accurately controlled so that fluid balance errors do not occur.</p><p>The infusate is either provided from the manufacturer in bags or generated by filtering the dialysis fluid within the dialysis machine. Continuous HDF, such as is used for treatments in intensive care units, utilizes fluid provided in bags by the manufacturer. When infusate is administered from bags, the rate of infusion is regulated independently from the rate of ultrafiltration, which increases the complexity of the dialysis procedure.</p><p>For chronic renal replacement therapy, infusate is usually generated by the dialysis machine, which is much less expensive than using bagged fluid. This is referred to as online HDF. The infusate can be used for priming, washback, and, in heparin-free dialysis, for periodic flushing.</p><p>The infusate is drawn from the main dialysis fluid flow, downstream of the flow-balancing and control systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F103542\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103542 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The resulting reduction in volume in the dialysis fluid compartment drives additional ultrafiltration at exactly the same rate as the infusate flow. As a result, there is no effect on the patient's overall fluid balance and no need for additional fluid-balancing systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H835419636\"><span class=\"h2\">Clearance of urea and larger solutes in HDF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the clearance of large solutes is increased by convection. The degree of clearance is proportional to the ultrafiltration rate. Although the ultrafiltered volume is recorded for each treatment, the clearance of solutes other than urea is generally not measured and can be difficult to do so. The clearance of solutes can be calculated from the effective convection volume, blood volume processed, and the dialyzer membrane sieving and mass transfer area coefficients for the specific solute.</p><p>If the membrane coefficients for the solute are unknown, they can be predicted with knowledge of the membrane pore size, solute molecular radius, and the membrane coefficients for urea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693654285\"><span class=\"h2\">Prediction of solute clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total solute clearance is calculated from the diffusive clearance (K<sub>d</sub>) and convective clearance (K<sub>c</sub>) and multiplying by a dilution factor (DF).</p><p>Diffusive clearance is calculated from the effective blood flow rate (Q<sub>be</sub>), the dialysis fluid flow rate (Q<sub>d</sub>), and the solute-specific dialyzer mass transfer area coefficient (K<sub>o</sub>A). Convective clearance is calculated from the diffusive clearance, the effective blood water flow (Q<sub>be</sub>), and the ultrafiltration rate (Q<sub>f</sub>), taking the sieving coefficient, S, into account.</p><p>The clearance of any solute by HDF thus depends on the K<sub>o</sub>A, Q<sub>be</sub>, Q<sub>d</sub>, Q<sub>f</sub>, and the sieving coefficient (S).

The K<sub>o</sub>A for a range of solutes dissolved in water can be calculated from clearance values quoted in the dialyzer datasheet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">KoA = Qb <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> [1 &ndash; (Qb <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> Qd)] x ln [(1 &ndash; [Kd <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> Qd]) <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> (1 &ndash; [Kd <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> Qb])]</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clearance values in the datasheet were obtained by measurements &quot;in vitro&quot; using water as the solvent, not blood. To predict clearance in blood, the K<sub>o</sub>A values should, in theory, be adjusted by multiplying by a factor 0.72 to take account of the increased viscosity of plasma compared with water. K<sub>o</sub>A is proportional to the diffusion factor (D), which is inversely proportional to viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In online HDF, the infusion will subtract from the dialysis fluid flow rate generated by the dialysis machine. For predilution HDF, the effective blood water flow rate includes the upstream infusion.

Solutes other than urea transfer across cell membranes much more slowly, if at all. For example, transfer across cell membranes is approximately 50 times slower for creatinine than urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This results in significant differences in the behavior of urea during dialysis compared with other solutes. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urea is cleared from both erythrocytes and plasma water (approximately 85 percent of blood flow) as blood passes through the dialyzer. Solutes other than urea are cleared from plasma water only (50 to 80 percent of blood flow, depending on hematocrit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In blood samples, the urea concentration is similar in plasma and erythrocyte water, even in samples taken during or after dialysis. For solutes other than urea, there may be a large difference in concentration in between erythrocyte and plasma in samples taken during or after dialysis. As a result, concentrations in plasma may increase after sampling due to diffusion out of erythrocytes, which necessitates special handling for postdialysis samples. As an example, in order to obtain a valid postdialysis plasma creatinine concentration, samples should be taken into chilled tubes and separated immediately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During dialysis, the urea concentration in the intracellular compartment is similar to that in the blood. For solutes other than urea, dialysis may induce a large difference between the concentrations in intracellular and extracellular compartments. After dialysis, urea concentrations rebound upward approximately 10 percent and stabilize within approximately 30 minutes as urea is washed out of areas of low blood flow by the circulation. For solutes other than urea, the rebound is greater and takes longer to complete due to diffusion out of the intracellular compartment after dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73096614\"><span class=\"h2\">The postdialysis rebound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the end of a dialysis session, there is a significant upward rebound in the concentration of any dialyzed solutes in the blood. Any measure of dialysis efficiency based on the reduction in dialyzed solute concentration due to dialysis (eg, reduction ratio, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V)</span> should account for this rebound. The rebound depends on the dose of dialysis, the session time, and the rate of transfer between body compartments and is different for each solute. For most solutes, the post-rebound or equilibrated concentration (C<sub>eq</sub>) can be predicted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F104879\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104879 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Phosphate rebound cannot be predicted using this method, as phosphate kinetics are more complex and t<sub>p</sub> for phosphate is highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794154821\"><span class=\"h1\">ONLINE HDF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, in online HDF, the infusate is drawn from the main dialysis fluid flow, which obviates the need for additional fluid-balancing systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27939571\"><span class=\"h2\">Components and technology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dialyzer used in online HDF is the same as in high-flux dialysis. The dialysis machine must be capable of producing ultrapure dialysis fluid. The ultrapure fluid is produced by ultrafiltration of the dialysis fluid after the concentrates have been added. In some systems, the ultrafilters may be reused between treatments and disinfected as part of the machine's normal disinfection process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrapure-dialysis-fluid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrapure dialysis fluid&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For HDF, the majority of the ultrapure fluid is delivered directly to the dialyzer. An additional pump diverts some of this fluid into the blood lines via additional filters in order to render it sufficiently pure for infusion. These additional infusate filters are disposable in some equipment and may be reused in others. If they are reused, the filters are disinfected and tested automatically by the machine before use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F103542\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103542 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Control systems within the dialysis machine monitor the disinfection process and the integrity of the filters and fluid pathway. The infusate generated by the HDF system can be used for priming, wash-back, and flushing, which may offset the cost of the filters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794154877\"><span class=\"h2\">Infusion of replacement fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infusate may be delivered into the tubing upstream of the dialyzer (predilution), downstream of the dialyzer (postdilution), both upstream and downstream (mixed dilution), or into the middle of the dialyzer blood pathway (mid-dilution) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F103542\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103542 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postdilution -</strong> Postdilution infusion is used in the majority of HDF treatments. Postdilution infusion maximizes clearance for a given volume of infusate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, postdilution infusion often results in clotting and protein deposition (fouling) of the dialysis membrane surface. Clotting and fouling are related to the marked increases in hematocrit and protein concentrations within the dialyzer, caused by the high rates of ultrafiltration used in HDF. Clotting and membrane fouling increase transmembrane pressure (TMP) and reduce clearance by diffusion by restricting pore area and increasing the length of the diffusion pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fouling may be reversed by temporarily reducing ultrafiltration rate. Clotting, on the other hand, once established, is irreversible and requires a filter change or termination of the treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of clotting and fouling is increased with ultrafiltration rates greater than 20 to 25 percent of blood flow rate. However, ultrafiltration rates up to 30 percent can be achieved with systems that continuously control TMP based on measurements of ultrafiltration rate. Generally, all HDF systems have the hardware to run in TMP-controlled mode, although a software update may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The probability of fouling and clotting is increased when blood flow is interrupted. For that reason, a reliable vascular access is required for HDF. In intermittent treatments, extracorporeal blood flow rates of at least 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in adults and 5 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/kg</span> body weight or 150 to 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/m<sup>2</sup></span> body surface area in children are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. HDF also requires adequate anticoagulation throughout the procedure and the absence of any condition that increases blood viscosity (such as high hematocrit, cryoglobulinemia, gammopathies). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration#H3516873888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intermittent high-volume hemodiafiltration&quot;, section on 'Effective convection volume'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration#H2160717276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intermittent high-volume hemodiafiltration&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Predilution -</strong> For patients who cannot undergo postdilution HDF, predilution or mixed-dilution HDF combined with feedback control of TMP may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In predilution HDF, the infusion dilutes the blood components before ultrafiltration takes place. This reduces the risk of fouling and clotting and allows much higher ultrafiltration rates (typically over 60 percent of blood flow rate). Predilution does not completely remove the risk of fouling and clotting, as higher ultrafiltration rates are generally used with this method. The risk of clotting may also be increased, compared with conventional dialysis, since anticoagulant concentrations in the dialyzer are reduced by the dilution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite higher ultrafiltration rates, clearance rates are lower with predilution HDF compared with postdilution HDF. This is because solute concentrations in blood and ultrafiltrate are reduced by the upstream infusion, which reduces clearance by both diffusion or convection. Infusion rates have to be much higher in predilution HDF compared with postdilution to achieve the same clearance rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed dilution -</strong> In mixed-dilution HDF, a standard high-flux dialyzer is used. The infusate is delivered into the blood via two lines, one upstream and one downstream of the dialyzer. This combines the effects of both pre- and postdilution to optimize the clearance rate. The system may vary the rates of ultrafiltration, upstream, and downstream infusions, depending on measurements of pressure at various points to achieve maximum clearance without clotting or excessive pore blockage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mid-dilution -</strong> In mid-dilution HDF, special dialyzers are used. Infusion fluid enters the blood through an additional port in the dialyzer halfway down the dialyzer blood pathway. This system has been proposed to combine the benefits of both pre- and postdilution.</p><p/><p>In addition to these methods of delivering infusate, modifications to the fluid pumps have been described that cause variations in dialysis fluid pressure, resulting in alternating filtration and back-filtration of dialysate across the dialyzer membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This is called push-pull HDF. In push-pull HDF, the dialysis fluid acts as infusate and is filtered across the dialyzer membrane. Push-pull HDF provides some of the effects of predilution on clearance and coagulation, similar to mixed- or mid-dilution HDF. In addition, the intermittent back-filtration may remove protein deposition on the blood side of the membrane, making this technique suitable for prolonged treatments (eg, continuous treatment for acute kidney injury, nocturnal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]). Push-pull HDF is generally not available in standard HDF systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794155030\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiological safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of adverse effects of infused microbial contaminants is higher with HDF compared with standard hemodialysis or high-flux hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration#H3599044282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intermittent high-volume hemodiafiltration&quot;, section on 'Risks'</a>.)</p><p>The risk is related to the large volume of infusion required for HDF. In HDF, 10 to 100 liters of fluid may be infused directly into the blood each treatment.</p><p>The generation of ultrapure infusate and carefully monitoring and maintenance of the dialysis equipment are required to prevent contaminants from being infused. Whereas, in high-flux dialysis, there is some infusion of dialysis fluid into the blood across the dialyzer membrane at the blood outlet end, with online HDF, a greater volume is infused but is subject to more stringent control. Compared with a dialyzer, the infusate filter in HDF is a potentially better barrier to contaminants entering the blood as its membrane can be thicker and less porous.</p><p>To generate ultrapure dialysis fluid, the system disinfects the dialysis fluid pathway before each treatment. This process is monitored to ensure that bactericidal conditions (eg, pH, temperature) are present. The dialyze and ultrafilters upstream of the dialyzer are usually disinfected along with the rest of the fluid pathway, which allows them to be reused multiple times. Alternatively, the infusate filter may be changed with each treatment, allowing use of a new filter, which is sterilized and packaged by the manufacturer.</p><p>Repeated disinfection of the ultrafilters results in degradation and eventual failure of the membrane. Certain combinations of disinfectant and membrane material increase membrane permeability to contaminants (eg, bleach and polysulfone). The risk of membrane failure is reduced by optimization and control of the disinfection conditions, including use of the correct disinfectant, and planned, regular replacement of the ultrafilters. Membrane integrity can be tested automatically before each treatment by measuring the transmembrane pressure (TMP) drop during controlled ultrafiltration or by confirming that the wet membrane is airtight by a pressure-holding test. The system may also use multiple ultrafilters in series, which decreases the risk of membrane failure.</p><p>To generate infusion-quality fluid, a proportion of the ultrapure fluid is diverted into a port on the machine's case (the infusate port). A branch of the sterile single-use blood line set (connected into the venous bubble trap for postdilution) is connected to this port. An additional filter is situated in this pathway.</p><p>The location of this final infusate filter varies between systems. In one type of system, the final filter is integrated into the infusate branch of the single-use blood line set, downstream of the infusate port. In this case, the infusate filter is single use, and the user makes no connections in the sterile portion of the infusate pathway, downstream of the filter. The manufacturer is responsible for the sterility and competence of the filter, such that there is no additional disinfection or testing of the filter required at the point of care.</p><p>In another system, the infusate filter is reusable and situated within the dialysis machine, upstream of the infusate port. The filter is disinfected and tested along with the filters producing the ultrapure fluid upstream. In this case, the infusate port on the machine case delivers sterile fluid and must be specially designed and operated to avoid contamination when the user connects the infusate branch of the single-use blood line set. This second option is more complicated but potentially cheaper as all filters are reused.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H794155090\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLEMENTING HDF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Europe, equipment for online HDF must comply with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards 60601-2-16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These standards require manufacturers to perform formal risk analysis for their equipment and implement means to reduce risk to acceptable levels. There is no equivalent acceptance of the IEC standard by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 11663:2009 &quot;Quality of dialysis fluid for hemodialysis and related therapies&quot; recommends that dialysis fluid used for high-flux hemodialysis is ultrapure (&lt;0.1 colony-forming unit <span class=\"nowrap\">[cfu]/mL,</span> &lt;0.25 endotoxin unit <span class=\"nowrap\">[EU]/mL)</span>. The infusate for HDF must be sterile and nonpyrogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. ISO recognizes that it is not possible to confirm compliance by testing the infusate, since there is no test for absolute sterility. Instead, the standards require that online replacement fluid be prepared using a process validated by the manufacturer of the equipment.</p><p>As with all medical equipment, the responsibility for the safe operation of HDF is shared between the operator and the manufacturer. The manufacturer is responsible for the correct functioning of the equipment, for validating the process for delivering HDF safely, and for the user instructions. The user is responsible for following the manufacturer's instructions, for maintenance, and for operation.</p><p>With HDF, there is no common approach used by manufacturers to reduce risk, and different HDF systems employ different methods. These methods include multiple redundancy of the filters, planned replacement of filters long before they are likely to fail, automatic monitoring of the disinfection and replacement process, a single-use final filter, and automatic testing of the filter's integrity before use.</p><p>Manufacturers of HDF systems do not always publish the results of their risk assessments. The actions required to reduce risk are increasingly performed by automatic systems integrated into the dialysis machine, which may reduce the motivation for the user to understand them.</p><p>The manufacturer's risk assessments cannot be expected to cover the range of conditions that may arise in clinical practice, and risk cannot be reduced to zero. Therefore, the user should understand the risks to the patient from the specific HDF systems. Clinical vigilance is required to detect unexpected adverse events such as pyrogen reactions, leaks, and introduction of blood or air in the infusate line.</p><p>When implementing HDF, users' training and familiarity with the specific equipment are of more critical importance than with standard dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27938508\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a form of renal replacement therapy that utilizes convective and diffusive clearance. Compared with hemodialysis, HDF allows increased clearance of larger-molecular-weight toxins and may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H794154814\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intermittent high-volume hemodiafiltration&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDF requires the infusion of significant amounts (at least 15 to 20 and up to 150 L) of infusate to replace the ultrafiltrate. This infusate fluid must be sterile and pyrogen free since it is infused directly into the blood. In addition, the rate of infusion must be accurately controlled so that fluid balance errors do not occur. (See <a href=\"#H110984150\" class=\"local\">'Basic principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H794155030\" class=\"local\">'Microbiological safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In online HDF, the infusate is drawn from the main dialysis fluid flow, downstream of the flow-balancing and control systems. This obviates the need for additional fluid-balancing systems. The dialyzer used in online HDF is the same as in high-flux dialysis. The ultrapure fluid is produced by ultrafiltration of the dialysis fluid after the concentrates have been added. (See <a href=\"#H794154821\" class=\"local\">'Online HDF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replacement fluid (ie, infusate) may be delivered into the tubing upstream of the dialyzer (predilution), downstream of the dialyzer (postdilution), both upstream and downstream (mixed dilution), or into the middle of the dialyzer blood pathway (mid-dilution). Postdilution is used in the majority of HDF treatments. Risks associated with postdilution infusion include clotting and deposition of protein on the membrane surface (or fouling). For patients who cannot undergo postdilution HDF, predilution or mixed-dilution HDF combined with feedback control of transmembrane pressure (TMP) is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H794154877\" class=\"local\">'Infusion of replacement fluid'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technical-aspects-of-hemodiafiltration/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Tattersall JE, Ward RA, EUDIAL group.
