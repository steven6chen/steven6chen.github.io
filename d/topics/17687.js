Affected patients typically present with recurrent infections due to neutropenia, bleeding episodes due to thrombocytopenia, and fatigue due to anemia. Patients with AA are at risk of life-threatening complications, especially when pancytopenia is severe. Thus, a long-term approach to therapy is needed. </p><p>This topic reviews the treatment and prognosis of AA in adults.

The following issues must be addressed as part of treatment planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Possibility of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome</strong> &ndash; Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes include Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). These usually present in childhood but rarely may be seen adults. Additional features of these syndromes that suggest their presence, and the appropriate diagnostic evaluations, are presented separately. If one of these syndromes is present, additional considerations may apply to therapy, as discussed in detail separately.

The possibility of a hypoplastic MDS must be evaluated, especially in older adults (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Over age 50'</a> below), because therapy differs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Bone marrow findings consistent with MDS rather than AA are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underlying cause</strong> &ndash; If an associated underlying cause such as a drug reaction or infection is identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 1</a>), the potentially offending agent should be withdrawn <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated as appropriate. However, prolonged delay in therapy while awaiting spontaneous recovery generally is not advised because it increases the risks of serious complications of cytopenias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We generally do not wait longer than two to three months, although data are lacking regarding the typical interval for spontaneous recovery after drug discontinuation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease severity</strong> &ndash; As discussed in detail separately, AA is classified according to disease severity based on bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood cytopenias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe AA (sAA) is characterized by bone marrow cellularity &lt;25 percent of normal, which varies by age, and at least two severe peripheral cytopenias, such as neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-absolute-neutrophil-count\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), thrombocytopenia with platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anemia with absolute reticulocyte count &lt;20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other criteria have also been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In our practice, we use bone marrow cellularity &lt;10 percent and severe neutropenia, especially ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL,</span> which represents very severe AA (vsAA). Moderate AA (also called nonsevere AA) is used for patients with bone marrow cellularity &lt;25 percent and depression of at least two cell lines in the peripheral blood but without criteria for sAA. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with sAA or vsAA without an alternative underlying treatable cause of bone marrow failure, we stratify initial treatment according to patient age and the availability of a bone marrow donor. (See <a href=\"#H1947926\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with nonsevere (moderate) AA, optimal therapy is unknown, and we use a more individualized approach based on the patient&rsquo;s age, clinical status, and degree of cytopenias. Treatment similar to that for sAA may be appropriate for patients with progressive cytopenias, severe neutropenia, or transfusion dependence. Observation and supportive care may be associated with better outcomes and quality of life for individuals who are older or have mild or stable cytopenias. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clonal evolution</strong> &ndash; Individuals with AA are at risk for clonal evolution, which in some cases is associated with progression to MDS or acute leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H1325241101\" class=\"local\">'Clonal disorders'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Our approach is similar to a 2009 guideline from the British Committee for Standards in Hematology and the practice of other experts in the United States, although practice continues to evolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1949862\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF CYTOPENIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate supportive care for cytopenias is an integral component of therapy for patients with AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Transfusions, antibiotics, and, rarely, growth factors may be required. In very elderly individuals or those with moderate pancytopenia, these interventions may be the only therapy used. Importantly, however, these interventions do not alter the course of disease and should not be considered substitutes for appropriate therapy for individuals with severe AA who require (and can tolerate) definitive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1949446\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe anemia or thrombocytopenia may require transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> platelets. Of note, for any patient who is a potential candidate for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), transfusions should be used selectively in order to reduce the risks of sensitization to donor antigens. Blood products from a sibling or family donor should be avoided scrupulously in potential HCT candidates to minimize the risk of graft failure caused by an immune reaction to donor antigens. Equally importantly, however, transfusions should not be withheld in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">symptomatic/severe</span> anemia or <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/severe</span> thrombocytopenia. Appropriate transfusion thresholds, which may depend on patient symptoms and comorbidities, are presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>RBCs</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Platelets</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>As a general rule, we use leukoreduced products for patients with AA to reduce the risk of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions.

Some experts have suggested administration of prophylactic antifungal therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> in individuals with an ANC &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> based on improved survival with their use in patients with other hematopoietic stem cell disorders (eg, post-hematopoietic cell transplantation, acute leukemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Decisions regarding prophylactic antibacterials are more challenging because certain agents have been shown in other patient populations to reduce mortality but also to increase the risk of antibacterial resistance and deleterious changes in intestinal microflora; additionally, some antibacterials are myelosuppressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Additional strategies to reduce the risk of infection are also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-adult-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia#H15213457\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the adult with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Preventing infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccination for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1949869\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of growth factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levels of hematopoietic cytokines (growth factors) are generally quite high in individuals with AA at baseline, and growth factors generally are not used as part of routine management. Exceptions include the possible use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in individuals with frequent or severe infections, and the use of thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists in individuals with refractory disease. A potential role for TPO receptor agonists in improving hematopoietic stem cell function during initial therapy is under investigation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)</strong> &ndash; G-CSF is not standard therapy in AA. There is no evidence that G-CSF corrects the underlying hematopoietic stem cell defect in AA. Further, the addition of G-CSF to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) has not been associated with improvements in response rates or survival. (See <a href=\"#H1358100\" class=\"local\">'Modifications of the standard regimen'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another issue related to G-CSF administration is the theoretical concern that it might promote development or evolution of a clonal population of cells with cytogenetic abnormalities or mutations that could predispose the patient to develop myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The role of G-CSF in clonal evolution (if any) is difficult to determine because patients with acquired AA have an increased baseline risk of clonal disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1325241101\" class=\"local\">'Clonal disorders'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists</strong> &ndash; TPO receptor agonists (also called TPO mimetics) stimulate megakaryocytes well as multipotent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow. These agents have an evolving role in patients who are not transplant-eligible and those with refractory disease (eg, persistent thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other cytopenias despite IST). (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of TPO receptor agonists as a component of first-line therapy is under active investigation, as discussed below with several studies ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythropoietin</strong> &ndash; Erythropoietin is not used in AA, because there are insufficient erythroid precursor cells for it to be effective. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1947926\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1803044\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of approach: IST versus HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-line therapy is stratified according to the age of the patient, which correlates with ability to tolerate hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); the severity of disease; and the availability of an appropriate donor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F103822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103822 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>For the majority of patients under age 50 years with severe AA who have an available donor, we suggest a strategy of up-front HCT rather than initial immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or IST plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eltrombopag</a>. We feel more strongly about pursuing HCT in younger patients, especially those under 20 years and many under 50 years. The upper age limit for tolerating HCT and the size of the available donor pool continue to expand, and treatment-related <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> continues to improve with advances in therapy; as a result, the proportion of individuals for whom HCT is considered appropriate therapy continues to grow. On the basis of data presented at the 2016 American Society of Hematology meeting, we have begun to incorporate the results of myeloid somatic mutation panels in these patients. Patients with mutations in ASXL1 or DNMT3 appear to have a poorer response to IST and a greater propensity for clonal evolution. It may be that such a finding should lead to more intense consideration of the appropriateness of HCT. </p><p>For individuals with a sibling donor, HCT can usually be initiated within approximately six to eight weeks, and there is not a good rationale for providing IST <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eltrombopag</a> during this short period. If a search for an unrelated donor must be undertaken, there may be some benefit of providing eltrombopag, with or without IST. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis depending on several factors that include the severity of cytopenias, transfusion requirements, frequency or severity of infections, and availability and cost to the patient of eltrombopag. Patients for whom HCT is appropriate but who lack a donor are treated with eltrombopag plus IST, but the donor search should continue, especially for younger patients with severe disease. &#160;</p><p>The rationale for preferring HCT for younger patients with severe disease includes the high mortality rate of severe AA and the superior long-term outcomes (including survival) with HCT, especially in younger patients. Additionally, concerns remain regarding the degree and durability of responses with IST and a greater potential risk of clonal disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following IST. (See <a href=\"#H1325241101\" class=\"local\">'Clonal disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>However, a strategy of initial IST may be appropriate for some individuals for whom a suitable donor is not available, for older individuals who may not tolerate HCT, and for some individuals who place a higher value on avoiding the up-front mortality of HCT compared with IST. As discussed below, initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eltrombopag</a> plus IST is associated with excellent hematologic responses, but the duration of these responses is unknown, and this therapy does not prevent clonal evolution. (See <a href=\"#H1358128\" class=\"local\">'Evidence for efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1325241101\" class=\"local\">'Clonal disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Initial IST does not preclude later HCT, provided a donor is available and the patient remains in adequate health to tolerate the procedure.</p><p>Both HCT and IST require substantial expertise to administer. Early involvement of a transplant center or clinician with expertise in managing bone marrow failure syndromes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enrollment in a clinical trial is strongly encouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Evidence to support the use of HCT comes from observational studies; IST and HCT have not been directly compared in a randomized trial. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three prospective studies (302 patients) that compared IST with HCT were identified in a 2013 Cochrane review, in which allocation to HCT was based on availability of a sibling donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Major findings from this review were that overall mortality was similar between IST and HCT, and treatment related mortality from HCT ranged from 20 to 42 percent. However, the review noted that all three studies were performed in the 1980s and 1990s, before many of the currently available advances in therapy were made, and thus may not accurately reflect the standard of care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study involving 395 adults and children found that actuarial survival at 15 years was superior with HCT (69 versus 38 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75806 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Those who underwent HCT (using bone marrow) had an engraftment rate of 89 percent; IST produced a response rate of 44 percent (complete, partial, and minimal responses). The median age of patients undergoing HCT was 22 years (range 2 to 54) and the median age for IST was 25 years (range 1 to 74).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ongoing reductions in HCT-related morbidity and mortality over time has been illustrated in various case series. In a review of 1305 patients with AA who underwent HCT during different time periods, five-year survival increased progressively, from 48 percent (1976 to 1981) to 66 percent (1988 to 1992) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The improved survival was due primarily to decreased mortality in the first three months after transplant. Risks of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and interstitial pneumonia were also decreased. Similar improvements have been reported in other studies during this and subsequent time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

However, follow-up is relatively short (eg, two years). It is not known whether these responses are more durable than responses to IST alone, which are often incomplete and sometimes transient. Eltrombopag is a synthetic non-peptide agonist for the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (also referred to as a TPO mimetic). The mechanism by which it promotes disease response is likely to include activation of the TPO receptor (c-MPL) on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as well as megakaryocytes.

This practice is consistent with that of other experts, although the use of eltrombopag was only introduced in mid-2014 to 2015. Glucocorticoids are given with ATG to reduce the risk or severity of serum sickness; these may also have immunosuppressive properties but should not be used in isolation due to the increased risk of infection without demonstrated therapeutic benefit in AA.

Responses were superior in the CsA group (65 versus 39 percent), especially among patients with severe disease. Survival was greater in individuals with severe disease who received combination therapy; however, crossover and retreatment made direct comparisons difficult. A subsequent publication describing observation for over 11 years reported that among 43 patients whose disease responded to CsA, 11 (26 percent) required continued administration of CsA for more than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Five were able to discontinue CsA after five to nine years, and six remained on the drug for 10 to 12 years. Actuarial survival at 11 years was similar for those who received ATG plus CsA versus ATG alone (58 versus 54 percent).</p><p>The greater efficacy of horse ATG versus rabbit ATG was demonstrated in a 2011 trial that randomly assigned 120 consecutive patients with severe AA (children and adults) to receive horse ATG (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for four days) versus rabbit ATG (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days) in addition to cyclosporin as first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Hematologic response at six months, which correlates strongly with survival, was greater with horse ATG (68 versus 37 percent). Most responses occurred within three months. Relapse rates at three years were similar between the two groups (28 versus 11 percent), and overall survival at three years was superior in the horse ATG group (96 versus 76 percent). Additional case series have also observed greater responses to horse versus rabbit ATG; some of these comparisons occurred when horse ATG became temporarily unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

Alternatively, therapy with reduced doses of one or both of these agents could be tried. The best evidence regarding this practice is in patients over 50 years of age, for whom it is able to produce a good response rate, but not as good as standard therapy (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Over age 50'</a> above).

Importantly, however, these interventions do not alter the course of disease and should not be considered substitutes for appropriate therapy.

Testing for poor-prognosis mutations may be helpful in decision-making in some cases.

If a sibling donor is available, we proceed directly to HCT. For those who do not have an available sibling donor, we may use a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eltrombopag-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eltrombopag</a> or eltrombopag plus IST while aggressively searching for an unrelated donor.

Limited data suggest the addition of eltrombopag to standard IST is associated with improvement in cytopenias over the short term. Clonal evolution appears to be similar with and without eltrombopag. Eltrombopag dosing and schedule are described above. IST uses horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporin A (CSA), and glucocorticoids; if horse ATG is not available, we use rabbit ATG.
