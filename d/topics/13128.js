It occurs in almost 50 percent of all patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), with a reported prevalence of 4 per 1000 live births. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease#H2707568\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology, natural history, clinical manifestations, and evaluation of <strong>isolated</strong> VSDs in children will be presented here.

Defects in this region are referred to as membranous defects, and also are called perimembranous, conoventricular, or subaortic VSDs.</p><p>Membranous VSDs lie just beneath the aortic valve and behind the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Often these defects extend into the inlet or muscular septum, and can undergo partial or complete closure by apposition of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, forming a tricuspid valve &quot;pouch&quot; or &quot;aneurysm of the ventricular septum&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Less commonly, they can be closed by prolapse of an aortic cusp into the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Occasionally, these defects can be associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and coarctation of the aorta. Because the bundle of His lies in a subendocardial position and courses along the posterior-inferior margin of the defect, heart block is a potential surgical complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H364674811\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscular defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscular defects can be located along the right ventricular free wall-septal junction (marginal muscular defects), in the central muscular septum, or in the apical septum (component 2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51288 \">figure 1</a>). Small muscular defects are even more common in very premature infants. Muscular defects often close spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In particular, central muscular VSDs are more likely to close spontaneously and earlier than other muscular types of VSDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Multiple muscular defects, referred to as &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; septum, have the same net functional effect as a single large defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Apical defects may be covered by thick trabeculations of the right ventricle, making visualization difficult during right-sided surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Although the anatomic location may be similar to that of membranous defects, malalignment VSDs are in a separate category of VSDs. Anterior malalignment defects are part of the anatomic complex in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), whereas posterior malalignment defects cause various degrees of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Subpulmonic (outlet)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VSDs that are superior and anterior in location within component 3 are referred to as subpulmonic or outlet defects (also called supracristal, infundibular, conal septal, or doubly committed subarterial defects) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51288 \">figure 1</a>). These defects account for approximately 5 percent of defects in North America and western Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but are more common (approximately 30 percent) in the Asian population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Subpulmonic defects are located immediately beneath the valves of both arterial trunks. They commonly are associated with prolapse of the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve with or without aortic regurgitation. Outlet defects rarely close spontaneously. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Aortic regurgitation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">AV canal (inlet)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 percent of VSDs are inlet or AV canal-type defects. These defects occur posterior and superior between the annulus of the tricuspid valve and the attachments of the tricuspid valve to the right ventricular wall and septum (component 1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51288 \">figure 1</a>). Inlet defects are seldom isolated, and are more commonly associated with an atrial septal defect that is part of a complete AV canal or endocardial cushion defect. They do not close spontaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inlet defects occupy the area of septum inferior to the normal conduction tissue axis. This causes inferior deviation of the AV node and bundle of His, which results in abnormal QRS axis on electrocardiogram and vulnerability to AV block, both spontaneous and surgically-induced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163893470\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a VSD in utero has little effect on the normal cardiac physiology. In utero, the right ventricular output preferentially flows through the ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta to supply the abdominal viscera, lower extremities, and the placenta, with minimal flow to the high resistance pulmonary bed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 3</a>). Simultaneously, left ventricular output supplies flow to the head and neck with a small percentage of flow crossing the distal aortic arch. Thus, there is minimal shunting of blood even if there is a large ventricular communication, because shunting is dependent on the relative resistance to flow during systole, which is relatively equal in utero. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-left-to-right-shunts#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of left-to-right shunts&quot;, section on 'Fetal and transitional circulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;, section on 'Fetal circulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163893476\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following delivery, the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life involves the removal of the low resistance placenta from the circulation and the closure of the ductus arteriosus. In addition, there is an immediate fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and a continued, more gradual decline that extends over weeks to months. As a result, the neonatal left ventricle (LV) contracts against high systemic vascular resistance, while the right ventricle (RV) contracts against the lower resistance pulmonary circulation. In the absence of outflow obstruction, the difference in the resistance between the two vascular beds determines the direction of the shunt across the VSD post-delivery. This typically results in left-to-right shunting, except in untreated patients with moderate to large defects with pulmonary vascular resistance equivalent to systemic vascular resistance.

RV pressure remains normal or only minimally elevated; pulmonary artery pressures and PVR are normal and there is little increase in ventricular stroke work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In moderate defects (moderately restrictive defects) the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt depends primarily upon the size of the defect and the pressure differential between the RV and LV. In these patients, RV pressure, PVR, and pulmonary artery pressures may remain low or be moderately elevated. As the RV pressure decreases after birth, the shunt increases, which may lead to volume overload of the left atrium and ventricle with signs and symptoms of heart failure. Pulmonary pressure usually remains normal or only mildly elevated because of the restrictive nature of the defect and the resultant large pressure gradient from LV to RV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large defects (equal to or greater in size than the cross-sectional diameter of the aortic root) offer little resistance to flow; they are sometimes called &quot;unrestrictive defects.&quot; The pressure in the ventricles is equal and they function as a common pumping chamber with two outlets. The magnitude of the shunt depends upon relative pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. As PVR declines, there is a large left-to-right shunt that generates increased pulmonary blood flow, increased pulmonary venous return, and increased volume load to the LV. This left ventricular volume overload may result in LV dilation and increased end-diastolic pressure, which in turn may cause increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary venous pressure, and progressive symptoms of heart failure.

It declines more rapidly in preterm infants. In infants with moderate or large VSDs the decline in PVR may be delayed for several months. The rate of decline of PVR also is delayed by a number of other factors, including the development of pulmonary edema and altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects on pulmonary circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased pulmonary blood flow may result in increased ventilatory effort, primarily tachypnea, but also dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over time, increased pulmonary blood flow can result in increased PVR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects on systemic circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with VSD who are shunting blood from the systemic to the pulmonic circulation, LV output must increase to maintain systemic blood flow at normal levels. The increase in LV output depends upon the size of the shunt. For example, a 50 percent left-to-right shunt results in a twofold increase in LV output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>By convention, the magnitude of left-to-right shunting is defined by the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs). Thus, Qp:Qs for a 25 percent shunt is 1.33:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As shunt volumes increase above 60 percent, small increases in shunt volume must be accompanied by dramatic increases in LV output to maintain systemic circulation at normal levels. When the LV is no longer able to maintain such increased output demands, systemic blood flow falls and high output failure ensues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Other factors that increase the demand for systemic blood flow in infants and children with VSDs include fever, sympathetic stimulation, increased respiratory effort, anxiety, and decreased hemoglobin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Defects located in the muscular septum close with the growth and hypertrophy of the surrounding muscular septum. Small membranous defects may close through apposition of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve secondary to negative pressure created by the jet through the defect.

Most cases with moderate-size VSDs respond to medical therapy, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) usually does not increase in these patients. As a result, surgical or catheter-based intervention is often not required. The risk of development of irreversible pulmonary vascular obstructive disease increases when pulmonary arterial pressures are greater than 50 percent of systemic pressures, a level which should prompt closure of the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Unless surgery is performed in the first year of life, there is increasing likelihood that elevated PVR will become fixed, preventing successful repair. Irreversible pulmonary vascular disease develops earlier in children with trisomy 21; large VSDs in such children should be repaired by three to four months of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the rare case of a large VSD that persists into late childhood without intervention, the increase in PA blood flow from persistent left-to-right shunting results in the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling and histologic evidence of pulmonary arteriolar intimal and medial hypertrophy. The resulting elevated PA vascular resistance leads to RV pressure overload and RV hypertrophy. When PVR exceeds systemic vascular resistance, the ultimate reversal of flow with right-to-left shunting causes hypoxemia, a condition called Eisenmenger syndrome. It is a serious, and generally irreversible, medical problem resulting in death as early as the third decade. However, a small study suggests that there are some select adolescent and adult patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (defined by systolic PA pressure &gt;70 percent of systemic systolic pressure) and uncorrected VSD (with or without great artery anomalies) who may benefit from a palliative procedure, such as a pulmonary arterial band to improve functional class and provide a small chance of eventual total repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The diastolic murmur is a high-frequency decrescendo murmur that begins with the first component of the second heart sound and is best heard at the mid to lower sternal border.

Alternatively, some VSDs may be located slightly more superior to the tricuspid valve apparatus, allowing direct LV to RA flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

VSDs occur in isolation or in combination with other congenital heart disease (CHD) defects, as in an atrioventricular (AV) canal, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and, occasionally, D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation and natural history of isolated ventricular septal defects in children depends upon the size of the defect. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Size of defect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small VSDs are usually detected by the presence of either a holosystolic or blowing high pitched systolic murmur of variable length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104797\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104797 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104799\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104799 \">movie 2</a>). The murmur located at the mid to lower left sternal border is typically detected during routine healthcare visits. These defects rarely cause symptoms, and often close spontaneously. Clinical manifestations of closure include shortening and ultimate disappearance of the murmur, and the continued lack of symptoms. Small VSDs that persist into adulthood typically remain benign. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Small VSD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate VSDs with low pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) usually present with heart failure and poor growth in infancy due to left atrial and ventricular volume overload. Cardiac examination reveals a dynamic precordium, a holosystolic murmur (with or without a thrill) at the mid to lower left sternal border (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104797\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104797 \">movie 1</a>), and increased second component of the second heart sound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104785\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104785 \">movie 3</a>). The presence of a diastolic murmur at the apex indicates a ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs) of at least 2:1. The presence of a diastolic murmur at the mid to lower sternal border may indicate aortic or pulmonary regurgitation and warrants further evaluation. Moderate defects decrease in size with time and may close spontaneously. In the interim, signs and symptoms of cardiac failure in patients with moderate defects can usually be controlled with pharmacologic and nutritional interventions. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Moderate VSD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H4267242324\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Moderate to large VSD'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Large nonrestrictive VSDs with elevated PVR present in infancy with heart failure and failure to thrive. Examination findings are similar to those in infants with moderate defects. In infants with large defects, irreversible pulmonary vascular changes may begin within 6 to 12 months and may be advanced by two to three years of age. Large defects may decrease in size, but rarely close completely.

The clinical presentation in these infants may be more subtle. If these infants are not treated, PVR progressively increases and right-to-left shunting may occur.
