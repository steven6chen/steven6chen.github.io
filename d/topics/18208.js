The cardinal prenatal findings are monochorionic placentation with concordant gender and discordant amniotic fluid volumes (maximum vertical pocket: donor &lt;2 cm and recipient &gt;8 cm). TTTS is associated with a high risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> mortality, especially in previable gestations, and fetuses who survive are at risk of severe cardiac, neurologic, and developmental disorders. </p><p>Twin anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS) is an atypical chronic form of TTTS without oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence. Prenatally, TAPS can be diagnosed when the middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) is greater than 1.5 multiples of median (MoM) in one twin and less than 0.8 MoM in the other twin, although criteria are not uniform across studies. Placental discordance is typically noted on ultrasound: the anemic donor has a thickened hyperechoic placenta and the plethoric recipient has a thinner hypoechoic placenta, with clear demarcation between the donor and recipient territories. &#160;</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis and diagnosis of TTTS and TAPS. Management of TTTS and TAPS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin-twin transfusion syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H852070650\"><span class=\"h1\">TWIN-TWIN TRANSFUSION SYNDROME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of TTTS is not clear since some fetal losses in monochorionic multifetal gestations in the first half of pregnancy may be related to undiagnosed TTTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For this reason, incidence based on data from live borns or sonograms in the second half of pregnancy may not be accurate. Our best estimate of the incidence of TTTS is 1:40 to 1:60 twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>], 9 to 15 percent of monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>], and 6 percent of monoamniotic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one report, monochorionic diamniotic twins conceived by in vitro fertilization had a lower incidence of TTTS than those conceived naturally <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/43</span> [2 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">36/284</span> [13 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no animal model for study of TTTS, but computer models have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Unbalanced vascular anastomoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Placental intertwin vascular anastomoses play a key role in the pathophysiology of TTTS. Dichorionic twins lack vascular connections between the placentas, even when fused, and do not develop TTTS. In monochorionic twins <span class=\"nowrap\">(2/3</span> of all monozygotic twin gestations), post-delivery placental injection studies have identified four types of vascular connections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arteriovenous (AV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Veno-arterial (VA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterioarterial (AA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venovenous (VV)</p><p/><p>AV and VA anastomoses consist of feeder vessels on the surface of the chorionic plate that descend into a common cotyledon capillary network where they anastomose. By comparison, AA and VV anastomoses are seen exclusively on the surface of the placenta. Flow in these latter two types of connections is bidirectional; the net flow is related to opposing hydrostatic pressures of each fetus.</p><p>Although vascular connections are found in virtually all monochorionic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>], only 9 to 15 percent of these twin pregnancies will ultimately develop TTTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The initial process that triggers the TTTS phenotype in some monochorionic twin pregnancies but not others has not been determined. One hypothesis is that when arterial and venous connections are being established to the placental villous tree around the fifth week of gestation, overlapping vascular boundaries of each twin allow formation of various anastomotic connections in the single placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Computer modeling has demonstrated that if the connections are unbalanced (ie, there are more AV connections in one direction than in the other), then increasing hydrostatic and osmotic forces will result in the TTTS phenotype. However, if the connections are balanced (ie, equal numbers of bidirectional anastomoses), then TTTS does not develop.</p><p>In addition, placental injection studies have shown that AA anastomoses are protective against the development of TTTS. In two large studies of monochorionic placentas, about 95 percent had AV connections and 70 to 85 percent also had AAs anastomoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In contrast to AV anastomoses, AA anastomoses were rare to nonexistent in pregnancies with TTTS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular response to circulatory imbalance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precipitating event for the development of TTTS is likely to be relative hypovolemia in one twin (called the donor twin) in response to the imbalance in placental vascular anastomoses. In an attempt to restore its intravascular volume, several vasoactive mediators are released. The donor twin's vasopressin level becomes elevated to three times the level of the other twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The donor twin's renin-angiotensin system (RAS) also appears to be upregulated, based on the finding of significant levels of renin protein and mRNA and associated renal tubular dysgenesis on histochemical investigation of donor kidneys at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These hormonal derangements result in oliguria, which ultimately results in anhydramnios and the &quot;stuck twin&quot; phenotype.</p><p>The nondonor twin experiences hypervolemia and is called the recipient twin. Hypervolemia causes its cardiac atria to stretch and release atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Mean ANP levels are three times higher in recipients than donors, while mean BNP levels are twice as high in recipients compared with donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These two hormones have potent natriuretic and vasodilatory properties, resulting in fetal polyuria and eventually leading to polyhydramnios in the recipient's sac.</p><p>The cardiovascular changes in the recipient twin appear to be progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Initially, hypervolemia is compensated by increased urine output, but eventually donor deterioration results in elevated levels of renin and angiotensin, which pass through placental anastomoses to the recipient. Plasma endothelin-1 levels also appear to be higher in recipient fetuses than their donor siblings, possibly related to placental dysfunction on the recipient's side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Both the RAS mediators and endothelin-1 contribute to hypertension in the recipient. Doppler measurements of the regurgitant jet of the tricuspid valve in the recipient twin have found systolic pressures increased 2.5-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The increased systemic pressure in the recipient vascular system increases umbilical artery length compared with the corresponding umbilical vein, which creates redundancy of umbilical artery in the umbilical cord and increases its diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This corresponds with elevated levels of <span class=\"nowrap\">NT-ProBNP/protein</span> levels in the amniotic fluid, suggesting the chronicity of hypertension. These changes lead to a fall in urine output, with resolution of polyhydramnios.</p><p>Hypervolemia and abnormal concentrations of vasoactive mediators results in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomegaly and cardiac dysfunction in the recipient twin. Acquired or functional right ventricular outflow tract abnormalities, including pulmonary stenosis and functional or anatomic atresia, have been observed in approximately 10 percent of recipient twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Hypertrophy can develop in one or both fetal cardiac ventricles. (Hypertrophy is measured with ultrasound and defined as ventricular wall or intraventricular septal thickness greater than 2 SD for gestational age). Echocardiographic studies have revealed that right-sided myocardial dysfunction is two to three-fold more common than left-sided dysfunction, which is not surprising since the right ventricle is the dominant ventricle in the fetal heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Depressed myocardial contractility and severe tricuspid regurgitation can be identified in addition to reversed a-wave on Doppler interrogation of the ductus venosus. Functional obstruction of the pulmonary artery is signified by reverse filling of the ductus arteriosus from the aortic arch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In addition, hemodynamic imbalance may impair cerebral perfusion, leading to antenatal cerebral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Finally, venous hypertension results in movement of intravascular fluid into the interstitial spaces and functional lymphatic obstruction. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTTS is usually first suspected because of characteristic findings on ultrasound examination (discussed below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The mother is usually asymptomatic, but symptoms related to excessive uterine distention may occur, including inability to lay supine, insomnia, inability to eat, lower abdominal pain, and pelvic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Mirror syndrome has been reported in cases with a hydropic fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p>The prenatal diagnosis of TTTS is based upon ultrasonographic evidence of a single monochorionic placenta with <span class=\"nowrap\">polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios</span> sequence (POS). Before 20 weeks gestation, the maximum vertical amniotic fluid pockets for oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios are usually defined as &lt;2 cm and &gt;8 cm, respectively. After 20 weeks, the maximum vertical pocket for polyhydramnios is defined as &gt;10 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, the cervical length in TTTS is normally distributed, with a mean &plusmn; standard deviation of 38&plusmn;10 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A cervical length &lt;28 mm is associated with increased risk for preterm birth after fetoscopic laser surgery.</p><p>Recipient arterial lengthening can be quantified using two-dimensional or three-dimensional color Doppler of a segment of cord near the placental cord insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Atypical presentations can occur; as an example, the donor twin may have both a persistent bladder and abnormal umbilical Doppler flow. In addition, although higher stages are generally associated with a worsening perinatal prognosis, the clinical presentation of a particular case does not always follow an orderly progression of stages. As an example, a stage I case may progress rapidly in several days to Stage III and regression of disease can occur in as many as 15 percent of Stage I cases and 60 percent of Stage II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the cardiovascular system provides additional</p><p>insight into the pathophysiology and severity of TTTS. A cardiovascular scoring system has been reported from Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP score), based on echocardiographic and peripheral Doppler findings in a study of 150 donor and recipient fetuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78353 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When four grades of progressively worsening cardiovascular abnormalities were compared to Quintero staging, marked differences were noted. As an example, when fetuses classified as Quintero stage II were reclassified by cardiovascular score, the spread of cardiovascular score grades from least to most severe was grade 1 (35 percent), grade 2 (30 percent), grade 3 (25 percent), and grade 4 (10 percent). However, a subsequent prospective evaluation of 158 cases of TTTS prior to laser therapy at another center failed to find an association between an increasing CHOP score and perinatal survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>The Cincinnati modification of the Quintero staging system is another cardiovascular scoring system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This system divides Quintero stage III into A, B, and C classifications based on progressively worsening echocardiographic findings of three parameters in the recipient fetus (eg, presence and severity of atrioventricular valvular incompetence, ventricular wall thickening, and ventricular function as assessed by the Tei index). Cases are &ldquo;upstaged&rdquo; from the Quintero stage based on the presence of these fetal echocardiography findings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for TTTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance of serial ultrasound examinations to assess growth is common in twin pregnancies. The optimum frequency of these examinations has not been established, and should probably depend upon on whether placentation is monochorionic or dichorionic. Monochorionic twins, in particular, should be monitored for development of TTTS since the disorder affects 9 to 15 percent of monochorionic gestations, has high morbidity and mortality, and interventions to reduce complications of the disease are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-management-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin-twin transfusion syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Onset of TTTS is usually gradual, but can be sudden. One study that prospectively followed 23 monochorionic twin gestations reported TTTS developed in four pregnancies at 16, 22, 24 and 29 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another series of 194 monochorionic twin gestations followed prospectively, TTTS occurred in 17 and the majority of deaths occurred prior to 24 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, monitoring into the third trimester appears to be necessary. The same authors subsequently reported that 13 of these fetuses developed discordant growth after 26 weeks of gestation and five of the 13 (38 percent) had twin anemia polycythemia sequence, but no amniotic fluid discordance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3978781000\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the data described above and our clinical experience, we establish chorionicity through ultrasound as early as possible (preferably in the late first trimester). In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis, nuchal translucency discrepancy &gt;20 percent, nuchal translucency &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile, crown-rump length discrepancy &gt;10 percent, or abnormal ductus venosus flow at the first-trimester scan were predictive of development of TTTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Nuchal translucency discrepancy and abnormal ductus venosus flow had the highest sensitivities at 53 and 50 percent, respectively. Reversed or absent a-wave in the ductus venosus at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation is also associated with an increased risk of development of other complications (eg, aneuploidy, miscarriage); however, pregnancy outcome is normal in about 40 percent of monochorionic twins with this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Nuchal translucency is routinely performed as a screening test for aneuploidy and congenital anomalies, but further studies are needed to assess the utility of first trimester ductus venosus Doppler examination as a screening test for TTTS before routine examination can be recommended.</p><p>In monochorionic gestations, we perform ultrasound examination every two weeks, beginning at 16 weeks of gestation and continuing until delivery. The purpose of the 16-week ultrasound is to assess amniotic fluid volume and determine whether the fetal bladders can be visualized. At 18 weeks, we perform an anatomical survey, as well as assess amniotic fluid volume and visualization of the fetal bladders. Doppler studies of umbilical artery, ductus venosus, and middle cerebral arteries is performed when discordance in amniotic fluid volumes is observed that does not meet the criteria for Quintero TTTS (maximum vertical pocket &lt;2 cm or &gt;8 cm). In subsequent ultrasound examinations, we alternate a limited assessment of just amniotic fluid volume and fetal bladder visualization with a complete assessment that includes assessment of fetal growth (serially every four weeks). </p><p>We also evaluate for placental findings suggestive of spontaneous TAPS (discordant placental echogenicity: thick hyperechoic placenta in the anemic donor fetus, and thinner hypoechoic placenta in the plethoric recipient fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341871758\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis of TTTS versus selective intrauterine growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) may be a complication of TTTS (typically involving the donor twin) or it may selectively affect one twin of a monochorionic twin gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In one series of 1651 monochorionic, diamniotic pregnancies referred for possible laser treatment of TTTS, 214 (13 percent) were found to have severe IUGR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Of these, 166 (76 percent) were diagnosed as TTTS, 45 (21 percent) were diagnosed as selective IUGR, and 3 were affected with additional abnormalities. In another review of a referral population suspected to have TTTS, 10 percent were diagnosed as selective IUGR alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Distinguishing TTTS complicated by growth restriction from selective IUGR can be difficult since in both situations the IUGR fetus may have oligohydramnios. The key finding for distinguishing between the two entities in a monochorionic twin gestation is the amniotic fluid volume of the non-IUGR twin: in pregnancies with isolated selective IUGR, the normally grown fetus will have a normal volume of amniotic fluid (defined as maximal vertical pocket &gt;2 cm and &lt;8 cm) but, in TTTS, the normally grown fetus is usually the recipient and often has excess amniotic fluid (&gt;8 cm). &#160;</p><p>A classification of selective IUGR based on umbilical artery Doppler blood flow studies in the growth-restricted twin has also been proposed to better understand the clinical behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In type 1 selective IUGR (best prognosis), the affected twin has a normal umbilical artery Doppler study with normal amniotic fluid volume. The perinatal outcome in these pregnancies is not appreciably different from unaffected monochorionic twins. Type 2 and 3 selective IUGR are classified by abnormal umbilical artery Doppler flow studies: persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">absent/reverse</span> diastolic flow in type 2 and intermittent <span class=\"nowrap\">absent/reverse</span> diastolic flow in type 3. In the majority of type 2 and 3 selective IUGR cases, the amniotic fluid volume is reduced or there is oligohydramnios (maximal vertical pocket &lt;2 cm). Fetal deterioration in type 2 twins can be predicted in most cases because of persistent and progressive changes noted by close fetal monitoring, while type 3 twins show an atypical clinical evolution of the IUGR twin, which fails to consistently show Doppler signs suggesting fetal deterioration. In a systematic review (13 studies, 610 pregnancies), pooled proportions for composite adverse outcome of monochorionic twin pregnancies with selective intrauterine growth restriction by type were: Type 1 (4.8 percent), Type 2 (23.8 percent), and Type 3 (16.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Twin pregnancies affected by Type 2 selective intrauterine growth restriction were at a higher risk of perinatal mortality (16 percent) and morbidity compared with those with Type 1 (4 percent), while Types 2 and 3 (12 percent) generally had a similar likelihood of an abnormal outcome, although Type 3 had an unpredictable clinical course. Variations in rates of adverse outcome across studies may be related, at least in part, to differences in definitions and in management and timing of delivery.</p><p>Determining the true diagnosis of TTTS versus selective IUGR is paramount in deciding on therapeutic options. Laser photocoagulation of placental anastomoses is the treatment of choice for TTTS with or without concomitant IUGR. Treatment for isolated selective IUGR is variable, based on expert opinion, and depends on gestational age. Aggressive fetal monitoring with early delivery or previable selective reduction may be considered, given the generally poor prognosis, especially with type 2 selective IUGR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. At this time, laser photocoagulation for the treatment of isolated selective IUGR is unproven and should be considered investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. </p><p>There is also significant overlap between the clinical findings of TTTS, selective IUGR, and TAPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109621 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110205 \">table 2</a>).

The small residual anastomoses allow slow passage of red cells usually from the former recipient to the former donor twin, gradually leading to highly discordant hemoglobin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome-and-twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].
