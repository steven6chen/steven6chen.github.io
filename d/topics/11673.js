The pregnant state can affect many neurologic diseases, while certain neurologic diseases or their treatments may have a significant negative effect on pregnancy, labor, or delivery. This topic review will focus on the relationship between pregnancy and a wide spectrum of neurologic illnesses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebrovascular disease during pregnancy results from any of three major mechanisms: arterial <span class=\"nowrap\">infarction/ischemia,</span> hemorrhage, or venous thrombosis. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with a marked increase in the relative risk and a small increase in the absolute risk of stroke.</p><p>Risk factors for stroke related to pregnancy include cesarean delivery, pregnancy-induced hypertension, postpartum infection, and possibly multiple gestations. In addition, conditions unique to pregnancy can occur, which can present as either a stroke or a stroke-like event. These include eclampsia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, peripartum angiopathy, and gestational trophoblastic disease. Of these, <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> is the most common cause of stroke in pregnancy. Other causes are listed in Table 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60303 \">table 1</a>). The risk of stroke in women with <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;, section on 'Indications for antihypertensive therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Cerebrovascular disease and stroke in pregnancy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebrovascular disorders complicating pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system typically characterized by relapses and remissions of neurologic deficits. MS affects women more than men by a ratio of approximately 2:1; the mean age of onset of MS is approximately 30 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and epidemiology of multiple sclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During an MS exacerbation (relapse), patients typically complain of a progressive neurologic deficit developing over several days. Common symptoms of an exacerbation include those associated with optic neuritis (decreased visual acuity in one eye or ocular pain) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asymmetric numbness, weakness, or ataxia. Pain is rarely a symptom of a MS flare but can be a long-term complication of chronic MS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no accepted guidelines for recommending for or against pregnancy in women with MS. Each patient's MS history and current neurologic deficits should be considered independently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of pregnancy on MS activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there has been disagreement as to the overall effect of pregnancy on multiple sclerosis (MS), a meta-analysis of 13 studies with 1221 pregnancies published in 2011 concluded that pregnancy is associated with a significant <strong>decrease</strong> in MS disease activity, while the postpartum period is associated with an <strong>increase</strong> in MS activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The best individual report data come from the prospective PRIMS study:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first report of the PRIMS study, 254 women with MS were followed during 269 pregnancies and for 12 months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The mean rates of relapse before pregnancy, in the first trimester, in the second trimester, in the third trimester, and in the first three months postpartum were 0.7, 0.5, 0.6, 0.2, and 1.2 per woman per year, followed by a return to the prepregnancy rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There was no acceleration in the rate of disability or disease progression postpartum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neither epidural anesthesia nor breastfeeding had an adverse effect on the rate of relapse or progression of disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second PRIMS report evaluated 227 women from the first series who delivered a liveborn term infant to determine clinical predictors of postpartum relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Relapse in the first three months postpartum was most likely in women with an increased relapse rate in the prepregnancy year or an increased relapse rate during pregnancy. However, these factors correctly predicted presence or absence of early postpartum relapse in only 72 percent of women.</p><p/><p>Subsequent reports have also found a decrease in MS activity during pregnancy and an increase in MS activity during the early postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In an observational case-control study of 893 pregnancies in 674 women with MS, an increased risk of relapse in the first three months of the postpartum period was associated with a higher annualized relapse rate in the two years prior to conception (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 14.1, 95% CI 9.1-21.9), while a lower risk of postpartum relapse was associated with the use of disease modifying therapy in the two years prior to conception (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>When the protective effect during pregnancy and the increased risk in the early postpartum period are combined, the net effect is no increase in the risk of exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Similarly, long-term disability due to MS is not altered by pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Stress, exhaustion, infection, and the loss of antenatal immunosuppression may account for the increased relapse rate during the first three months of the postpartum period. </p><p>Pregnancy does not appear to affect the type or severity of MS exacerbation. The available evidence suggests that pregnancy does not increase the risk of developing MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/10,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543013512\"><span class=\"h2\">Assisted reproductive technology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no definitive data, assisted reproductive technology (ART), which includes in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other similar techniques, appears to increase the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One prospective study of 16 women with relapsing-remitting MS treated with 26 ART cycles observed a 7-fold increase in the risk of MS exacerbation and a nearly 9-fold increase in the risk of new brain lesions by MRI in the three months following ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is unclear whether one or more of the exogenously administered hormones (eg, GnRH agonist, FSH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>) or the rapid changes in reproductive hormone levels in women undergoing ART, or both, were responsible for the increase in MS disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Results from earlier studies suggested that ART was associated with a more modest increase in the risk of MS relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. The variably increased risk of MS exacerbation with ART in these reports may be due to differences in the regimens employed, such as use of GnRH antagonists instead of GnRH agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of MS on pregnancy outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While evidence regarding the effect of multiple sclerosis (MS) on pregnancy is not entirely consistent, the available data suggest that maternal MS is associated with an increased rate of caesarean delivery and lower infant birth weights compared with women without MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest study analyzed an inpatient database with an estimated 15 million deliveries in the United States from 2003 to 2006, including 4730 in women with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Multiple sclerosis was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-3.3) and cesarean delivery (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.4).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from Norway evaluated a nationwide registry of over two million births from 1967 through 2002 and identified 649 births among 461 mothers with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Mothers with MS had a higher proportion of infants who were small for gestational age (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.14-1.84). Mothers with MS also had more frequent induction of labor and operative interventions during delivery. This finding was attributed to MS-related neuromuscular perineal weakness and spasticity, and it supports the straightforward notion that women who have difficulty pushing during the later stages of delivery due to neurologic deficits may require an assisted delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based cohort study from the state of Washington evaluated 198 women with MS and a comparison group of 1584 women who gave birth from 1987 through 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Compared with 1392 healthy control women, maternal MS was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk [RR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.7) and infants who were small for gestational age (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7).</p><p/><p>Spinal anesthesia has traditionally been avoided because of unsubstantiated concerns that it increases MS exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Epidural anesthesia has been safely used in patients for labor and caesarean deliveries. The choice of anesthesia, if necessary, should be based upon obstetric concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Mothers may need help postpartum and should consider the activity, stress, and fatigue required to care for a newborn infant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of MS in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy may affect the choice of therapy since some drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) are known teratogens, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriflunomide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73903 \">table 2</a>). Such drugs are contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. Management of relapsing-remitting MS during pregnancy includes consideration of several disease-modifying drugs, including interferons, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fingolimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fingolimod</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimethyl-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimethyl fumarate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a>.

Prior to attempting pregnancy, a washout period for disease-modifying treatments is advised.

Those who favor stopping disease-modifying therapies note that only limited evidence is available concerning their safety during pregnancy, and during which time the MS relapse rate is much reduced regardless (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Effect of pregnancy on MS activity'</a> above); disease-modifying medications can be started or restarted in the immediate postpartum period. Other experts note that the decision must weigh uncertain risks to the fetus posed by disease-modifying drugs for MS against clear benefits to the mother. Aborting pregnancy because of concerns regarding interferon beta, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> exposure is not supported by current data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Perhaps the highest quality evidence regarding the use of disease-modifying MS therapies during pregnancy comes from a systematic review that searched the literature through February 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The review identified 15 studies (4 prospective cohort, 5 retrospective cohort, and 6 case series) that evaluated pregnancies exposed to interferon beta drugs (n = 761), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glatiramer-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glatiramer acetate</a> (n = 97), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> (n = 35).

The MS relapse rate was significantly lower for both the exposed and unexposed groups during pregnancy compared with the baseline relapse rate prior to pregnancy. These findings are limited by the retrospective, nonrandomized nature of this study.</p><p>Acute MS attacks (relapses) during pregnancy are treated with intravenous glucocorticoids, which are not teratogenic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>). Glucocorticoids may, however, cause neonatal adrenal suppression, maternal glucose intolerance, and increase the risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes. Thus, short-term, high-dose regimens are recommended. There is no contraindication to restarting prophylactic treatment immediately postpartum. In addition, patients with a previous history of postpartum exacerbation may benefit from the administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Patients with a primary or secondary progressive MS are sometimes treated with immunosuppressive therapy, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>.

All patients in all groups with incomplete paralysis ultimately recovered satisfactory function.

GBS is thought to result from an immune response to a preceding infection that cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of molecular mimicry. The immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve, resulting in demyelinating and axonal forms of GBS. It typically begins within thirty days of an infection. A small percentage of patients develop GBS after another triggering event such as immunization, surgery, or trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cardinal clinical features of GBS are progressive, mostly symmetric muscle weakness and absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. Severe respiratory muscle weakness necessitating ventilatory support develops in about 30 percent, and dysautonomia occurs in 70 percent of patients. GBS usually progresses over a period of about two weeks, followed by a plateau phase of two to four weeks, and then gradual recovery of function.

These treatments hasten recovery from GBS, as shown in randomized controlled trials. However, neither treatment has been studied specifically in pregnant women with GBS. Aggressive fluid loading prior to plasma exchange may help to avoid hypotension.

In addition, autonomic dysfunction may be severe enough to require intensive care unit monitoring. Thus, many patients with GBS are initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of respiratory, cardiac, and hemodynamic function. Less severely affected patients can be managed in intermediate care units.

Increased cerebrospinal fluid pressures have been observed in normal women during painful uterine contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This could potentially lead to neurologic compromise in a woman who already has a baseline elevation in intracranial pressure. Thus, careful consideration should be given to the type of delivery. Depending upon the location and size of the mass, a cesarean delivery under general anesthesia may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. There are insufficient data to assess risk and make a general recommendation; advice of subspecialists in neurology and neurosurgery is advised in each case.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Pituitary adenoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy also promotes the growth of lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas). Neurologic symptoms most often develop in patients with macroadenomas (13 to 36 percent) but also occur in a few patients (less than 2 percent) with microadenomas (defined as less than 10 mm in diameter). Pregnant women with known pituitary adenomas may present with new onset headache or visual changes that can be difficult to differentiate from migraines and other headache disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used when necessary during all trimesters of pregnancy to rule out growth of the adenoma or pituitary apoplexy from ischemia or hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Functional occlusion of the shunt most often occurs in the third trimester. The rise in intraabdominal pressure caused by the enlarging uterus may exceed the pressure within the peritoneal catheter, resulting in the cessation of cerebrospinal fluid drainage with a subsequent elevation in intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Symptoms include confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, headache, nystagmus, and cranial nerve palsies. These symptoms require urgent evaluation, neuroimaging, and neurosurgical consultation.</p><p>Preconception counseling should include description of the risks and an MRI for establishing baseline ventricular size and to verify adequate shunt function.</p><p>Although there are no controlled studies examining the best method of delivery for pregnant women with VP shunts, there seems to be agreement that vaginal delivery can be attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>]. Shortening the second stage has been recommended by some, but not all authors to reduce the rise in intracranial pressure that occurs during pushing. However, increased intracranial pressure should not occur with a properly functioning valve.</p><p>Caesarean delivery is recommended for neurologically unstable patients and those with obstetrical indications for surgical delivery. Care should be taken to avoid dislodging or manipulation of the abdominal tip of the shunt while the peritoneal cavity is open. Both regional and general anesthesia can be used in pregnant women with VP shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Prophylactic antibiotics have usually been recommended for labor and delivery to avoid shunt infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/79,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,85</a>]; however, the risk of infection is low and this practice has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

In contrast to males with spinal cord injury, fertility is not usually compromised. This section discusses the management of pregnancy in a woman who has had a previous spinal cord injury.</p><p>Common complications of spinal cord injury include anemia (from iron deficiency, folate deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, and chronic renal insufficiency), urinary tract infection, decubitus ulcers, and respiratory problems. Serial urinary tract cultures or antibiotic suppression is recommended to avoid upper urinary tract infection and its associated morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Thermoregulation is impaired so that hypothermia can occur from cutaneous vasodilation and inability to shiver, while hyperthermia results from impairment of the normal sweating mechanism. Due to the tendency to spasticity and contractures, muscle-strengthening exercises for the upper extremities may be recommended for appropriate patients; range of motion exercises may be useful in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. The management of chronic complications of spinal cord injury are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Baseline pulmonary function studies should be performed in those who are contemplating pregnancy and pulmonary function should be reassessed serially during pregnancy to identify women who might need ventilatory assistance in labor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are insufficient data to recommend universal thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy or the puerperium for all patients with spinal cord injury; each case should be addressed individually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Vaginal delivery is permissible. The ability to perceive labor pain is dependent upon the level of the injury. Women with cord injuries below T11 will be able to perceive labor pain, while those with lesions at T5 to T10 may have painless labors and deliveries. Such women should be monitored to avoid an unattended delivery from undetected labor. They may suspect labor from other clues such as spasticity and flexor spasm. They should also be taught uterine palpation to help detect contractions, and use of a home uterine monitor, weekly cervical examinations, and liberal hospitalization can be considered near term. Although some others have observed a higher frequency of preterm labor, most series report rates similar to that in the general obstetrical population.</p><p>These precautions may be particularly important for women with lesions above T5-6 level for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are prone to slightly earlier delivery (36 to 40 weeks rather than 38 to 42 weeks).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighty-five percent develop autonomic dysreflexia during labor. The disorder can be precipitated by distension or irritation of the cervix, vagina, bowel, or bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51824 \">table 3</a>). The manifestations of this potentially life-threatening syndrome result from sympathetic hyperactivity below the level of the lesion, since this portion of the spinal cord has been isolated from hypothalamic control. Symptoms include malignant hypertension (which may be confused with preeclampsia), loss of consciousness, headache, nasal congestion, facial erythema, sweating, piloerection, bradycardia or tachycardia, and arrhythmia. Uteroplacental vasoconstriction may develop, leading to fetal hypoxia. The symptoms are exacerbated by contractions and wane between contractions. Continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythm and blood pressure are warranted as cerebrovascular accidents, intraventricular hemorrhage, or myocardial infarction may occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Autonomic dysreflexia'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Epidural anesthesia extending to the T10 level should be used to prevent these manifestations, even if the patient does not perceive pain; antepartum consultation with an anesthesiologist is important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic management of pain during labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An indwelling Foley catheter will prevent bladder distention and a bowel regimen is useful to prevent bowel distention from constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. If symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia occur, it is important to make sure the catheter is draining freely and the bowel is not impacted.</p><p>If the patient has not yet received anesthesia and is supine, having her sit up leads to pooling of blood in the lower extremities and may reduce blood pressure. Antihypertensive medications (such as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>) are given as needed. However, patients with spinal cord injury maintain systemic blood pressure by compensatory enhancement of the renin&ndash;angiotensin&ndash;aldosterone system. For this reason, they may be very sensitive to medications that inhibit the function of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors). If severe hypertension persists despite anesthesia and intravenous antihypertensive medications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> may be considered, but is relatively contraindicated since it may cause cyanide intoxication in the fetus.
