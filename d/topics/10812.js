Initial concerns about pregnancy's impact on prognosis in women diagnosed with melanoma date back to case reports from the 1950s. These reports suggested that pregnancy might lead to transformation of nevi into melanomas, increase the growth rate of existing melanomas, and cause localized melanomas to metastasize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Subsequently, multiple observations seemed to support the argument that melanoma is a hormonally responsive malignancy: changes in skin pigmentation during pregnancy, detection of hormone receptors on some melanomas using older technology, a higher incidence of melanoma after puberty, and relative immunosuppression during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. </p><p>The management of women diagnosed with melanoma during pregnancy is likewise controversial, particularly concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and decisions about the management of the patient with nodal or metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In this topic, we will review the data that address prognosis for those diagnosed with melanoma before, during, and after pregnancy. In addition, this topic will address management, including initial biopsy of suspected melanoma, wide local excision, SLNB, and decision-making concerning the use of subsequent hormonal therapy and future pregnancy. </p><p>The general approach to cutaneous melanoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2885659465\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS OF PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED MELANOMA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4249129067\"><span class=\"h2\">Study limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have looked at the relationship between pregnancy and cutaneous melanoma. Factors limiting the interpretation of the literature include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the case series prior to the 1980s did not account for the most important prognostic factors, such as depth of tumor or stage of disease. Subsequently, there have been a number of small case-control studies and large population-based cohort studies. While the case-control studies have the advantage of including important prognostic factors, the small numbers of patients included are an important limitation. Conversely, the larger cohort studies lack complete data on staging and Breslow depth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the larger studies do not distinguish between diagnosis of melanoma during pregnancy and diagnosis during the postpartum period. Such studies refer to these patients as having pregnancy-associated melanoma (PAM). The definition of PAM varies in different studies and ranges from diagnosis during pregnancy to diagnosis up to five years after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is significant variability in the techniques and quality of the statistical analysis of the data between studies and in the presence of age-matched nonpregnant control groups, as well as a lack of consideration of important confounding factors, including but not limited to age, anatomic site of lesion, sun exposure or season at time of diagnosis, depth of the melanoma, absence or presence of ulceration, and presence as well as number of mitoses per mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2327232283\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the multiple small controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>] and large population-based cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18-21</a>] do not show a negative influence of pregnancy on survival. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most recent of the large population-based studies is a Swedish registry-based study, which compared cause-based mortality in 1019 women with PAM (defined as melanoma diagnosis during pregnancy through the period up to two years postpartum) with women diagnosed with melanoma who did not become pregnant during a comparable period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When focused upon women diagnosed with melanoma during pregnancy, the PAM group was comprised of 247 women, which had no significant difference in mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.44-1.41) when adjusted for pertinent prognostic factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 10 case-control studies that included 185 women diagnosed with melanoma during pregnancy and 5348 women of the same childbearing age who were diagnosed with melanoma but were not pregnant, pregnancy did not have an impact on survival and did not increase the risk of a second melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The higher the parity and the younger the age of the mother at her first delivery, the lower the risk of melanoma. Thus, the authors concluded that there was no reason for physicians to recommend deferral of subsequent pregnancies in women who have been diagnosed with a stage I melanoma during a previous pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most recent and controversial study is a single-institution study that compared 41 women diagnosed with PAM with a control group of women of childbearing age who were not pregnant within one year of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. PAM was defined as melanoma diagnosis either during pregnancy or within one year after delivery. After adjustment for stage, age, and location, the PAM group showed a five-, seven-, and ninefold increase in mortality, metastasis, and recurrence, respectively, when compared with controls. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in this study, the number of relevant patients in the PAM group becomes much smaller since melanoma in situ cases comprised 50 percent of the PAM group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. More importantly, there is inconsistent reporting of staging information in the paper such that the authors report double the cases of advanced disease in the PAM group later in the manuscript compared with an earlier statement in the text, thus profoundly affecting their analysis due to the small number of cases. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1605535905\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis postpartum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple large population-based cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,10,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,20-22</a>] and one small controlled study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] have generally found no influence on prognosis when melanoma is diagnosed up to five years following delivery, except for one study that observed an enhanced risk of death from melanoma in the first year postpartum, which may be due to delayed diagnosis during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most detailed information comes from the Swedish registry study of 1019 women with PAM, which defined PAM as melanoma diagnosis during pregnancy and up to five years postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When the melanoma diagnosis in each postpartum year is evaluated independently from diagnosis during pregnancy, there is no evidence of a negative impact on survival when evaluating HRs for each year postpartum; PAM groups in each year included approximately 200 to 300 cases and more than 10,000 controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large retrospective English study that linked data from a national cancer registry and hospital discharge data evaluated patients diagnosed with melanoma up to five years postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There was a significantly increased death rate in the first year after delivery (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.32-2.79) but not in the four subsequent years postpartum. Another study found a lower incidence of melanoma diagnosed during pregnancy than expected compared with the first six months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The spike in melanoma diagnosis and death in the early postpartum period may be caused by a delay in diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3479165919\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis prior to pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have addressed the impact on prognosis when melanoma is diagnosed before a woman becomes pregnant, but based upon the available data, there does not appear to be an effect on prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/11,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15,18</a>]. In a large Swedish retrospective cohort study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], 966 women who had pregnancies after a diagnosis of a primary melanoma were compared with 4567 women who did not become pregnant after diagnosis. After adjustment for Breslow depth, tumor site, Clark level, and age, pregnancy did not significantly affect survival (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32-1.05). </p><p>For patients with a history of melanoma and multiple dysplastic nevi, we suggest more frequent dermatology examinations during pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2124646361\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF MELANOMA DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation and management of the pregnant woman are similar to that of the nonpregnant woman and are based upon stage of disease. However, there are potential concerns that arise even in the initial biopsy of suspected melanoma. As the stage of disease becomes more advanced, evaluation and management decisions become more complex in order to ensure safety of the mother and the fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196436164\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A changing pigmented lesion during pregnancy that is clinically and dermatoscopically of concern as a possible melanoma should be biopsied immediately, as it would be in a nonpregnant patient. Excisional biopsy is the optimal way to evaluate a primary cutaneous melanoma.

Under the new US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy guidelines for lidocaine, lidocaine &quot;may use during pregnancy; risk of fetal harm not expected based on limited human data.&quot;</p><p>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> as a vasoconstrictor to local anesthetic solutions has been endorsed as safe in the AAD guidelines. The local vasoconstriction minimizes serum levels of epinephrine, making a significant effect on placental vessels very unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Under the FDA's new pregnancy classification, epinephrine's &quot;benefits outweigh risks during pregnancy; possible risk of teratogenicity based on limited or conflicting human data; risk of teratogenicity based on animal data at up to 30 times maximal recommended human dose; possible risk of decreased uterine perfusion based on drug's mechanism of action.&quot; However, the guidelines do caution to delay &quot;urgent surgery&quot; until the second trimester, if possible, and if &quot;large amounts&quot; of anesthesia are necessary, consultation with the patient's obstetrician should be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521905466\"><span class=\"h2\">Wide local excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a wide local excision is performed under local anesthesia, the same considerations about choice of local anesthesia hold, as discussed for the initial biopsy.</p><p>If a wide local excision is to be performed under general anesthesia, the procedure should be coordinated with the obstetrician, anesthesiologist, and neonatologist.

Some centers refrain from using blue dye due to risk for anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Likewise, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends avoidance of blue dye and the use of technetium-99 alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There is accumulating evidence that the radiation exposure to the fetus is minimal, even when the injection site is as close as 5 cm to the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Some advocate waiting until the second trimester to minimize exposure of the fetus to surgery and medication during pregnancy, especially during organogenesis. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery#H430928420\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery#H431208945\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;, section on 'Outcome of pregnancy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a European survey in which 290 questionnaires were completed by &quot;melanoma physicians,&quot; almost half of respondents preferred to delay SLNB until after pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This approach may be supported by a study that observed no difference in survival if the interval between wide local excision and SLNB was a median of 47 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The Yale Melanoma Unit supports this position, and recommends wide local excision under local anesthesia during pregnancy but delay of the SLNB until after delivery if general anesthesia is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, at other institutions, this procedure is not delayed as it is viewed as important for staging, with SLNB performed during pregnancy in the second trimester and beyond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a wide local excision is to be performed under general anesthesia, the procedure should be coordinated with the obstetrician, anesthesiologist, and neonatologist.

Complete lymph node dissections have been performed as well, if the SLNB is positive, without reported harm to the fetus or mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3550480513\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of a woman with advanced melanoma, imaging studies may be considered. According to a Committee Opinion Summary published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists' Committee on Obstetric practice, chest radiograph with appropriate shielding, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; preferably without gadolinium) are the techniques of choice for imaging of the pregnant female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, studies such as other radiography, computed tomography (CT) scan (without contrast), and nuclear medicine imaging studies can be utilized since they are typically administered at doses that do not lead to fetal harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-and-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Likewise, a retrospective review analyzed both clinical and pathologic characteristics of 34 melanomas diagnosed during pregnancy and up to one year after delivery, and compared these with melanomas from age- and disease-matched controls.
