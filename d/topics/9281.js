The disorder is usually treated with pharmacotherapy by a psychiatrist, internist, or nurse practitioner. If cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is used in addition to or instead of pharmacotherapy, a psychologist generally provides the psychotherapy. However, psychiatrists, internists, and nurse practitioners can provide all of the treatment if they are trained to administer CBT; treatment by a single clinician is often preferable because it allows for a better understanding of the patient and more consistent care. Patients who are either resistant or refractory to treatment are typically referred to a psychiatrist. </p><p>The goal of treatment for intermittent explosive disorder is remission, which is defined as resolution of symptoms or improvement to the point that only one or two symptoms of mild intensity persist. For patients who do not achieve remission, a reasonable goal is response, ie, stabilizing the safety of the patient and others, as well as substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms. Response can be quantified (eg, improvement from baseline &ge; 50 percent) with standardized rating scales such as the clinician administered Overt Aggression Scale-Modified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], but this is not standard clinical practice.</p><p>Patients with intermittent explosive disorder should be advised to avoid intoxication with alcohol and other substances. Epidemiologic studies suggest that substance use disorders significantly increase the risk of violent behavior in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, a laboratory study with 56 healthy men found that alcohol intoxication significantly increased aggressive behavior, especially at lower levels of provocation, when most individuals are inclined to behave non-aggressively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172988769\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that clinicians treat intermittent explosive disorder with pharmacotherapy plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), based upon randomized clinical trials that have demonstrated the limited benefit of each treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. However, no head-to-head trials have compared CBT plus pharmacotherapy with pharmacotherapy alone or CBT alone. In addition, no trials have compared pharmacotherapy alone with CBT alone. Thus, it is reasonable to use either treatment alone based upon treatment availability, patient preference, prior response, and cost.</p><p>CBT teaches patients to anticipate and better manage aversive environmental stimuli and may thus prevent aggressive impulses. Medications may increase the threshold at which an aggressive impulse triggers an explosive outburst. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2535417\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of treatment outcome in patients with intermittent explosive disorder generally ranges from daily to monthly, depending upon the severity of persistent symptoms. Hospitalized patients are monitored daily. Outpatients are commonly seen on a weekly basis until they have responded (ie, the safety of the patient and others has stabilized and the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms has improved substantially) for two to four weeks. At that point the patient can be seen every two to four weeks until they remit. Patients who subsequently deteriorate may need to resume a more frequent schedule of visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23115154\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several medications have demonstrated efficacy for treating impulsive aggressive behavior in patients with intermittent explosive disorder or other psychiatric disorders (eg, borderline personality disorder). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23115147\"><span class=\"h4\">First-line</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as first line pharmacotherapy for intermittent explosive disorder because of their demonstrated efficacy, tolerability, and ease of use. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluoxetine</a> has been studied most often and is thus preferred. However, other SSRIs are reasonable alternatives. Based upon the duration of treatment in most randomized trials, we suggest 6 to 12 weeks of treatment (beginning from day one) before determining whether the drug is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10</a>]. Clinicians can expect that approximately 66 percent of patients will respond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].</p><p>The usual starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> is 20 mg taken once daily. For patients who do not respond within two to four weeks, the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg per day, depending on how well the medication is tolerated. Patients who remain unresponsive to treatment should receive additional increases of 10 to 20 mg per day every two to four weeks as tolerated, to an effective dose. The maximum dose is 60 mg per day. The dose schedule for other SSRIs and the adverse side effects of SSRIs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Support for treating intermittent explosive disorder with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> includes a 12-week randomized trial that compared fluoxetine with placebo in 100 patients with intermittent explosive disorder plus a personality disorder (primarily obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, or borderline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Moderate to large improvement occurred in significantly more patients who received fluoxetine than placebo (66 versus 29 percent). Side effects that occurred significantly more often with fluoxetine included sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbance, nausea, vomiting, and restlessness. </p><p>Other studies indirectly support using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> to treat intermittent explosive disorder. A meta-analysis of an unspecified number of randomized trials (3992 patients treated for a variety of psychiatric disorders) found that impulsive aggressive behavior occurred in significantly fewer patients who received fluoxetine than placebo (0.2 versus 0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, other randomized trials have found that fluoxetine reduces impulsive aggressive behavior in borderline personality disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and alcoholic perpetrators of domestic violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23115162\"><span class=\"h4\">Resistant patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with intermittent explosive disorder often do not respond to an SSRI within 6 to 12 weeks of starting the drug. For these resistant patients, we suggest tapering and discontinuing the SSRI over one to two weeks at the same time that another medication is started and titrated up. (Response is defined as stabilizing the safety of the patient and others, as well as substantial improvement in the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms.) The SSRI is generally tapered by the same amount for each dose decrease. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 40 mg per day is decreased by 10 mg per day, every one to two days. </p><p>We suggest using the following drugs in sequence for resistant intermittent explosive disorder rather than trying a second SSRI, because of the demonstrated efficacy of the drugs listed below and the lack of evidence that a second SSRI is effective in patients resistant to an initial SSRI trial. The following drugs are listed in order of preference, based upon how often each drug has been studied and how well it worked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We suggest 6 to 12 weeks of treatment (beginning from day one) before determining whether the drug is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10</a>].

A 12-hour serum trough level should be checked two weeks after the first dose, and one week after any dose change. Although there are no data correlating serum levels with efficacy in reducing impulsive aggression, toxicity can be prevented by maintaining the serum concentration &le; 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>.

CBT teaches patients how to manage aversive stimuli in the day-to-day environment, and may thus prevent aggressive impulses that can trigger explosive outbursts. Efficacious anger management interventions for patients with disorders other than intermittent explosive disorder typically make use of CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Specific techniques used in CBT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive restructuring (ie, modifying faulty assumptions and dysfunctional thoughts about frustrating situations and perceived threats; the patient is encouraged to examine the validity of the assumptions and thoughts in light of all the available evidence)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation training (eg, deep breathing as well as progressive muscle relaxation that consists of tensing and relaxing different muscle groups while imagining situations that provoke anger)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping skills training (eg, role playing potentially provocative situations and rehearsing responses such as walking away)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse prevention (educating patients that recurrence of impulsive aggressive behavior is common and should be viewed as a lapse or &ldquo;slip&rdquo; rather than failure) </p><p/><p>CBT works best for highly motivated patients who value a problem-solving approach to their illness. Conversely, CBT is contraindicated for patients who cannot learn the specific techniques that are taught (eg, patients with moderate to severe cognitive deficits) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>CBT can be administered in either a group or individual format. Patients typically receive 8 to 16 sessions of therapy, but some treatment plans may call for 20; each session lasts approximately 60 minutes. The skills taught in therapy are practiced in between sessions.</p><p>Evidence of efficacy includes a 12-week randomized trial that compared group CBT, individual CBT, and a wait-list control condition in 45 patients with intermittent explosive disorder who were not receiving pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A clinically large and statistically significant reduction of impulsive aggressive behavior occurred in patients who received CBT compared with the control group; only minor differences were observed between group and individual CBT.

Motivation should be reassessed and the use of pharmacotherapy discussed if a medication has not been prescribed. CBT should be terminated for patients who do not engage in treatment (eg, skip appointments without calling ahead or make no effort to complete homework) despite repeated efforts upon the part of the clinician. Patients who terminate treatment should be allowed to return when they are ready to actively participate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23115231\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest maintenance pharmacotherapy for intermittent explosive disorder using the same medication and dose that induced remission. Based upon our clinical experience, the risk for recurrence of impulsive aggressive outbursts generally persists for months to years. However, there is little high quality evidence to guide decisions about maintenance treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1960049\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance pharmacotherapy for intermittent explosive disorder may cause side effects (eg, sexual dysfunction due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>) that necessitate lowering drug doses within the target dose range. Side effects and target dose ranges are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H23115154\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with intermittent explosive disorder who cannot tolerate maintenance pharmacotherapy with the minimum target dose of the drug that induced remission, we suggest switching to another drug. The failed medication is tapered and discontinued over one to two weeks by the same amount for each dose decrease. (As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 40 mg per day is decreased by 10 mg per day, every one to two days.) At the same time, the new drug is started and titrated up. The choice of the new drug depends upon which medications, if any, were unsuccessful during acute treatment. Medication options, doses, and side effects are discussed elsewhere in the topic.

Particular attention is given to explosive outbursts, including physical assaults, verbal threats of interpersonal violence, and destruction of property. Symptoms of intermittent explosive disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H3220792\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermittent explosive disorder in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring can be tapered for patients who remit and remain stable, with progressively longer intervals between assessments. As an example, a patient who is seen every two weeks at the time of remission can be seen every two weeks for one or two more visits, then every month for one to three visits, and then every two months for one to three visits. Continuously stable patients can ultimately be seen every three to six months. More frequent visits should be scheduled for patients who develop symptoms or side effects; monitoring acutely ill patients is discussed elsewhere in the topic.

However, the duration is not established, and some patients require treatment for many years. The duration depends upon clinical factors and is generally longer in patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual symptoms, particularly aggressive impulses and chronic anger </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing comorbid psychopathology </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial impairment or stressors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of suicide attempts or nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A greater number of prior explosive outbursts (eg, &ge; 30 physical or verbal outbursts)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of illness for several years (eg, &ge; 5 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of more severe impulsive aggressive behavior (eg, physical assaults that lead to hospitalization)</p><p/><p>If the decision is made to discontinue maintenance pharmacotherapy for intermittent explosive disorder, we suggest slowly tapering the medication over one month to increase the probability of detecting incipient symptoms (eg, subthreshold incidents in which patients briefly scream) before full-blown explosive outbursts recur. Based upon clinical experience, we decrease the dose each week by approximately 25 percent of the dose used during maintenance treatment. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 40 mg per day is reduced by 10 mg per day each week until it is discontinued. </p><p>If symptoms recur during the taper, the dose should be titrated back up to the full dose used initially to achieve remission. If full-blown explosive outbursts develop despite increasing the dose, and the safety of the patient and others does not stabilize and the number, intensity, and frequency of symptoms do not substantially improve within 6 to 12 weeks of increasing the dose, the recurrence is treated as a new acute episode. Acute treatment is discussed elsewhere in the topic.

For medications that do not have a suggested therapeutic serum concentration, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>, the dose should be increased within the target dose range as tolerated. For medications that have a suggested therapeutic serum concentration, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, clinicians should ensure serum concentrations are in the therapeutic range, and increase the dose to achieve a higher serum level within the therapeutic range, provided that side effects do not intervene. </p><p>If impulsive aggressive behavior recurs during maintenance pharmacotherapy and optimizing the dose does not control symptoms within 6 to 12 weeks, the recurrence is treated as a new acute episode. (See <a href=\"#H172988769\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with intermittent explosive disorder who decide to stop maintenance pharmacotherapy and successfully taper and discontinue their medication, but subsequently relapse, we suggest restarting the same medication that was discontinued. The relapse is treated as a new acute episode.

A review of 16 studies of aggressive behavior in males found that the number of aggressive outbursts may decrease as patients get older, while aggressiveness as a trait (eg, chronic anger or confrontational behavior with others) may persist throughout adult life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermittent-explosive-disorder-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23115127\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with intermittent explosive disorder are periodically unable to restrain impulses that result in verbal and physical aggression.
