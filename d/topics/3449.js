The definition focuses on impairment of gastrointestinal function, implying a significant amount of malabsorption of both macronutrients and micronutrients, rather than focusing on the loss of a specific segment or length of bowel. The most common causes of SBS include necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), congenital intestinal atresia (single or multiple), gastroschisis, volvulus (midgut or segmental), extensive Hirschsprung disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>SBS due to surgical resection is the most common cause of intestinal failure, which is the state when an individual's gastrointestinal function is inadequate to maintain nutrient, growth, and hydration status without intravenous (IV) or enteral supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition to SBS, causes of intestinal failure in children include intestinal motility disorders (ie, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction) and intestinal epithelial defects (ie, congenital enterocyte disorders). </p><p>The majority of complications seen in patients with SBS are related to the site of resection, the process of intestinal adaptation, and the need for parenteral nutrition over the short or long-term. Acute and chronic complications of SBS are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107859 \">table 1</a>). Patients with irreversible or life-threatening complications, or with loss of adequate central venous access, may be candidates for small bowel or combined liver-small bowel transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Preventing complications should be a priority for all clinicians managing patients with SBS. These patients are complex and require coordination across many fields. A multidisciplinary team approach has been adopted in many centers across the world, consisting of a team made of gastroenterologists, surgeons, neonatologists, dieticians, <span class=\"nowrap\">nursing/nurse</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">practitioners/physician</span> assistants, pharmacists, <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/feeding</span> therapists, social workers, and other ancillary health professionals. Such multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation programs are associated with reduced morbidity and mortality among pediatric patients with intestinal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The chronic complications of SBS in children are reviewed here. An overview of the management of SBS and its pathogenesis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WATERY DIARRHEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Watery diarrhea is the most common early complication of SBS in children, and may also be a chronic or recurrent problem. It is particularly likely to occur as enteral nutrition is being advanced. Most often, it occurs when the osmotic load in the small intestinal lumen exceeds the absorptive capacity. The fluid volume presented to the intestines also may be a contributing factor. Occasionally, watery diarrhea can be caused by malabsorbed bile salts in the colon (bile acid diarrhea, a secretory diarrhea). Watery diarrhea often results in excessive fluid losses and electrolyte imbalances in patients with SBS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1614713404\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's anatomy (length and segments of residual bowel) can be used to set expectations but do not consistently predict feeding tolerance; enteral feeds must be individualized based upon the patient's response. Careful assessment of stool <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ostomy output are critical to assess enteral tolerance, permitting advancement of feeds while avoiding excessive osmotic load, and ultimately permit weaning off of parenteral nutrition. These data, as well as laboratory measures of serum and stool electrolytes, are important to assess hydration status and to design and provide adequate replacement fluids. Situations that may exacerbate hypovolemia (eg, excessive heat exposure) should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3040155180\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of watery diarrhea may include one or more of the following interventions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluid replacement</strong> &ndash; Provision of adequate parenteral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enteral fluids to replace excessive losses is the most important method to prevent or treat dehydration in children with SBS, due to their high and often fixed losses of water, nutrients, and electrolytes. Fluid needs are typically supplied by a combination of parenteral nutrition and enteral feeds, but some patients require supplemental intravenous (IV) or enteral fluids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral or enteral rehydration therapy &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oral rehydration solutions</a>, if tolerated, should be the standard and initial mode for replacing gastrointestinal losses and should be initiated immediately to prevent dehydration. These solutions generally contain a suitably designed mix of water, electrolytes, and carbohydrates to replace diarrheal losses. Enteral nutrition (feeds) should be introduced as soon as possible to help avoid dehydration, intolerance, weight loss, or micronutrient deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intravenous fluid therapy (IVF) &ndash; IVF may need to be added (&quot;Y&quot;-ed in) with parenteral nutrition on an ongoing basis, or provided when parenteral nutrition is not infusing. Isotonic fluids (ie, normal saline or Lactated Ringer's solution) may be warranted in cases of severe dehydration or significantly increased stool output above the patient's typical baseline. Some patients, such as those with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease, require particularly careful management to avoid fluid overload. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dietary changes</strong> (typically made in collaboration with a dietician skilled in the management of SBS) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Enteral feeding'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreasing the osmotic load in the intestinal lumen &ndash; This can be accomplished by slowing the enteral infusion rate, transitioning to a low <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/high</span> fat enteral formula, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> switching from bolus to continuous enteral feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eliminating dairy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soy from the diet or transiting to an elemental diet or formula &ndash; A subset of patients with SBS have an allergy to cow's milk protein. Such patients usually benefit from switching to an extensively hydrolyzed or elemental (amino acid-based) formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, elemental formulas also have a high osmotic load so caution is advised after the transition is made. (See <a href=\"#H2520804390\" class=\"local\">'Allergic and eosinophilic disease'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Changing to a blenderized formula or pureed diet administered by gastrostomy tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is unclear why blenderized or pureed feeds are beneficial for some patients; possible mechanisms include increased fiber content, delay in gastric emptying due to viscosity, or alterations in enteroendocrine hormones that decrease intestinal motility. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Introducing solids with fiber, such as green beans (eg, for infants receiving solid foods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Changing to a formula with a higher medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil content (eg, &gt;50 percent of fat from MCT) may be helpful in cases in which the watery diarrhea is caused by malabsorbed bile salts or in patients with cholestatic liver disease. This is because MCTs do not require bile salts for digestion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transitioning to formulas with low fat content may help in situations where diarrhea is from fat malabsorption. However, this approach should be undertaken with caution because fats are usually an important source of calories for patients with SBS, and are often better tolerated than carbohydrates. In addition, care should be taken in long-term use of a low-fat formula because patients may develop essential fatty acid deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antimotility agents</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antimotility agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">loperamide</a>, may be helpful in slowing gut transit and enhancing absorption and are generally safe for children. By slowing intestinal motility, water and sodium loss from an ileostomy is reduced by approximately 20 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

These doses are higher than those used for patients without SBS. However, loperamide should be used judiciously, as this medication can theoretically predispose to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which can exacerbate malabsorption.

The diarrhea in these patients may be caused by malabsorbed bile acids entering the colon (bile acid diarrhea), and cholestyramine prevents this process by sequestering bile acids. However, cholestyramine must be used judiciously since some patients may have bile acid deficiency; in these patients, cholestyramine may bind the remaining bile salts necessary for fat and fat-soluble vitamin absorption, thereby creating additional unwanted nutritional complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Improvement in the diarrhea during a trial of cholestyramine supports the diagnosis of bile acid diarrhea. In this case, the medication should be continued, but the patient should be monitored for nutritional status and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The recommended dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cholestyramine</a> is 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (up to a maximum of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day)</span> in three divided doses to be given before meals. Cholestyramine can interfere with absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, D and K). To avoid this interaction, vitamin and mineral supplements should be given separately from the cholestyramine (eg, more than one hour before or four to six hours after the cholestyramine).

Undigested fiber can be metabolized to short-chain fatty acids by aerobic colonic bacteria and used as a primary energy source for colonocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Recommended dosing starts at 1 percent of total formula volume, gradually increasing to 2 to 3 percent as tolerated. Caution should be taken due to the potential increased risk of bacterial overgrowth as well as malabsorption of minerals at doses above 3 percent of total formula volume.

Patients with recurrent CVC complications are at risk for losing central venous access, which in some cases is an indication for intestinal transplantation. All efforts must be made to preserve CVC function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H382924755\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CVC-related bloodstream infections can be life-threatening and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. These may be caused by contamination and improper care of the catheter. Bacterial translocation from disordered gut epithelium in a patient with SBS can contribute to the risk for recurrent CVC infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. Some reports suggest that the intestinal microbiome of patients with SBS inherently predisposes to bacterial translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>In addition to immediate risks for sepsis, CVC-related bloodstream infections are associated with hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis, and are an independent predictor of progressive liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Furthermore, in infants with SBS, suboptimal somatic growth (as measured by weight-for-age Z-scores and length-for-age Z-scores) is independently associated with &ge;2 CVC-related bloodstream infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention</strong> &ndash; The risk of CVC-related infection seems to be particularly high during the first month of home parenteral nutrition use and in children younger than one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Therefore, instruction of the parents or caregivers in CVC care should be initiated as soon as the patient has been identified as a candidate for home parenteral nutrition, and their proficiency should be confirmed before discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is advised that two caregivers become proficient in home central line care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The CVC should not be submerged in water, due to the risk of infection. Patients with CVCs are encouraged to bathe as long as the area of the body with the CVC is not submerged and is appropriately protected from contamination. Tips for bathing include using a protective cover over the CVC dressing (eg, AquaGuard, commercial plastic wrap with tape, or Parafilm). The patient can use a shower if they are able to stand and a bathtub if they cannot stand. A handheld showerhead is helpful to avoid water contamination. We generally advise patients not to swim, even in chlorinated pools, due to the risk of infection when the catheter is submersed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This is a difficult decision, balancing quality of life against risks for CVC infection and its complications. This and other decisions about activities that present risks for the CVC are best made in collaboration with the family after detailed discussion of the potential risks and benefits. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Prompt evaluation of patients with suspected CVC-related infection is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. We advise families and caregivers that a fever of &ge;100.4&deg;F (&ge;38&deg;C) in any patient with a CVC warrants immediate evaluation, including blood cultures and initiation of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. We routinely admit these patients for inpatient monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment</strong> &ndash; Treatment of bacterial CVC-related bloodstream infections consists of systemic IV antibiotics. Provided the child is clinically well, an attempt to salvage the catheter is appropriate for children with SBS who require long-term parenteral nutrition because these patients have limited options for venous access. In this case, the CVC is left in place and the infection is treated with the appropriate systemic IV antibiotics. For patients who are receiving ethanol lock therapy to prevent CVC-related bloodstream infections, the ethanol lock therapy can continue while systemic IV antibiotics are used, and we often increase its frequency to daily. If a patient is not already on ethanol lock therapy, initiation of this therapy should be considered. Antibiotic lock therapy is less frequently used in SBS patients unless the infection is refractory to standard management. Moreover, there is no advantage to adding antibiotic lock therapy concurrently with systemic antibiotics because we routinely administer the systemic antibiotics through the CVC. Treatment is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fungal CVC-associated blood stream infections often require removal of the central line and prolonged IV antifungal therapy. CVC exit site infections can usually be treated with sterile dressing changes and systemic antibiotics if treatment is initiated early in the course.

The technique involves instilling 70% ethanol to dwell in the CVC when it is not being used for parenteral nutrition. This technique is increasingly utilized in intestinal rehabilitation programs in the United States and is typically initiated after the first CVC-related blood stream infection. Daily administration of the ethanol lock may be more effective than intermittent therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], especially if the patient is deemed high-risk.

Second, the acidity in the intestinal lumen tends to inactivate pancreatic enzymes, resulting in decreased nutrient absorption. Third, increased gastric fluid production leads to fluid losses, in the form of diarrhea or high ostomy output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Patients with SBS are prone to SIBO because of one or more of the following problems:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of the ileocecal valve &ndash; Many patients with SBS have no ileocecal valve, which helps to prevent retrograde migration of bacteria from the colon into the small intestine. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysmotility or abnormal intestinal anatomy (surgical blind loops) &ndash; Many patients with SBS have progressive dilatation of the small intestine as part of the adaptation response, which limits the efficacy of peristalsis in ridding the small intestine of bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suppression of gastric acid &ndash; Some patients with SBS are treated with drugs to suppress gastric acid to reduce fluid losses and improve nutrient absorption; acid suppression may increase the risk of SIBO because gastric acid normally inhibits bacterial colonization and growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parenteral nutrition dependence &ndash; In one study, SIBO was found to be strongly associated with parenteral nutrition dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This may be because SIBO interferes with intestinal function, thereby prolonging parenteral nutrition dependence due to intolerance of enteral nutrition. Conversely, parenteral nutrition dependence also may promote SIBO, due to lack of enteral feeding and intestinal peristalsis. </p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-etiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Etiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical manifestations and complications</strong> &ndash; Clinical manifestations of SIBO include an increase in energy requirement, weight loss, and exacerbation of diarrhea, and can delay weaning of parenteral nutrition. Bloating, gassiness, abdominal distension, and foul-smelling stool are additional clinical signs. In severe cases, colitis and ileitis may occur. This disorder tends to cause diffuse mucosal inflammation, but sometimes causes more focal inflammation and ulceration in a pattern that resembles Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In addition, the intestinal inflammation can elicit an inflammatory cascade, including endotoxemia, arthritis, and other symptoms. Finally, SIBO may be associated with more frequent blood stream infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Catheter-related complications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Malabsorption often develops in patients who develop SIBO, through two mechanisms. First, deconjugation of bile acids by the bacteria diminishes the intestinal absorption of monoglycerides and fatty acids. Second, the inflammatory response caused by bacterial overgrowth damages the absorptive surface, resulting in malabsorption and protein loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Vitamin B12</a> deficiency is common in SIBO because bacteria compete for dietary vitamin B12; patients who have undergone ileal resection are at particularly high risk because dietary vitamin B12 is absorbed in the terminal ileum via specific receptors. Measurement of serum vitamin B12 concentration can be used to screen for vitamin B12 deficiency, but if the results are borderline or discordant with other clinical features, the patient should be further evaluated with tests for serum or urine levels of the metabolites methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine. This is because vitamin B12 is required as a cofactor for the conversions of MMA to succinyl-CoA and of homocysteine to methionine, and vitamin B12 deficiency therefore leads to elevated levels of both MMA and homocysteine. However, elevated levels of MMA (in the absence of B12 deficiency) may also be observed in SIBO due to bacterial generation of these and other organic acids. Folate levels in patients with SIBO can be normal or high due to increased synthesis of folate by small bowel bacteria.

This is especially appropriate for patients with known risk factors such as intestinal dysmotility or a dilated or dysmotile bowel loop, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent episodes of SIBO. If a more definitive diagnosis is needed, the best approach is a quantitative culture of duodenal aspirates obtained during endoscopy for aerobes and anaerobes, with sensitivities to guide antibiotic choice. Growth of &ge;10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming unit per mL of any bacterial or fungal species is diagnostic of SIBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Care should be taken to avoid endoscopic suction prior to sampling the duodenal fluid, to avoid contamination of the sample with oral flora. Alternative diagnostic methods for SIBO include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> and glucose breath tests. Interpretation of breath tests in these patients is complicated because of rapid intestinal transit, which can cause false-positive results.

Alternatively, antibiotics can be selected based on sensitivity cultures, if the diagnosis of SIBO was made by culture of duodenal aspirate.

The medication history should be reviewed, and any medications that might promote bacterial overgrowth should be discontinued (eg, medications that reduce motility such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">loperamide</a>, or those that block acid production such as histamine 2 receptor antagonist [H2RAs] or proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]).

Patients with cholestasis or pancreatic insufficiency are particularly at risk, and warrant special attention to the monitoring of fat-soluble vitamin levels. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vitamin A deficiency may lead to night blindness and visual loss. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with rickets. Vitamin E deficiency may lead to neuromuscular disorders and hemolysis. Vitamin K deficiency is associated with epistaxis and bruising.

Measuring vitamin K deficiency by sending a PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence-II) is more sensitive than prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Elevated levels of PIVKA-II suggest vitamin K deficiency. Treatment of vitamin K deficiency is with oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous (IV) phytonadione; treatment should be administered if vitamin K deficiency is suspected in a patient with SBS, either because of bleeding or abnormal laboratory testing.

It is further exacerbated if there is concurrent vitamin D deficiency, which reduces calcium absorption. To optimize bone health, supplementation of calcium may be needed to ensure that the recommended daily intake is met. Oral or enteral supplementation of calcium is preferred but, if necessary, a combination of enteral and parenteral supplements may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Routine screening should include measurement of complete blood count (CBC) with red blood cell indices, serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), serum iron, reticulocyte count, and intermittent testing of stools or ostomy output for blood. It is important to check a C-reactive protein (CRP) with the iron studies because inflammation affects the accuracy of these results. The anemia associated with iron deficiency is typically microcytic, but this finding may be obscured if there is concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency (which causes macrocytosis). Some centers measure soluble transferrin receptor as an index of iron deficiency, but this has not been well validated.

An echocardiogram should be performed if cardiac dysfunction is suspected in a patient with selenium deficiency. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The tests for several of these trace elements are inaccurate if drawn during a time of inflammation: In the setting of inflammation, serum ferritin (an index of iron stores) and copper concentrations are increased whereas serum zinc, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">selenium</a>, iron, vitamin A and C concentrations can be depressed. Therefore, concurrent measurement of CRP is recommended at the time of testing for micronutrient deficiency, to determine if an inflammatory state is present and permit accurate interpretation of the results.

In addition, if small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is present, the bacteria compete for vitamin B12 and contribute to the deficiency (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Small intestine bacterial overgrowth'</a> above). Vitamin B12 deficiency is characterized by a macrocytic anemia and can lead to neurologic dysfunction (dementia or weakness, sensory ataxia, and paresthesias). Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency due to SBS usually require replacement via the intranasal or intramuscular route. Sublingual administration has also been reported in children, but the efficacy of this approach has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Severe magnesium deficiency is characterized by symptoms of fatigue, depression, muscle weakness, and neuromuscular excitability. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities are hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal or low parathyroid hormone (PTH). By contrast, PTH is elevated in patients with pure hypocalcemia. Magnesium deficiency may be difficult to treat because oral magnesium is poorly absorbed and causes osmotic diarrhea. As a result, some patients may require parenteral supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

They are an integral component of cell membranes with structural and functional significance in the retina and central nervous system. Patients with SBS are at risk for essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) if adequate essential fatty acids are not provided in parenteral nutrition. They are also at risk when transitioning from parenteral nutrition to enteral feedings because of malabsorption of fats. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">EFAD is characterized by hair loss, fatty infiltration of the liver, poor growth, developmental delay, poor wound healing, increased susceptibility to infection, and dermatitis, with hyperproliferation of the epidermis and increased transepidermal water loss. The transepidermal water loss is caused by altered composition of structural lipids in the stratum corneum, which disrupts the barrier function of the skin. In humans, biochemical evidence of EFAD may develop within days to weeks of inadequate essential fatty acid intake; the dermatitis may not present for weeks to months thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Laboratory testing for EFAD should be performed in SBS patients who develop suggestive symptoms or who are receiving chronic parenteral nutrition with a restricted IV lipid protocol (&le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> average) because restriction of parenteral lipids increases the risk for EFAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. EFAD is diagnosed when there is shift to the omega-9 fatty acid pathway, which increases the ratio of eicosatrienoic acid (mead acid) to arachidonic acid, also known as the triene:tetraene ratio, or Holman Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Triene:tetraene &ge;0.05 &ndash; mild EFAD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Triene:tetraene &ge;0.2 &ndash; moderate EFAD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Triene:tetraene &ge;0.4 &ndash; severe EFAD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Elevated eicosatrienoic acid (mead acid) has been shown to be an early indicator of EFAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic bone disease and rickets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SBS are at risk for metabolic bone disease primarily because of malabsorption of vitamin D and calcium, both of which are consequences of fat malabsorption. Reduced bone mineral content also may occur due to altered acid-base status and magnesium deficiency. The risk is further increased for infants born prematurely and by the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cholestyramine</a>, both factors that deplete vitamin D stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p>Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, as indicated by suboptimal concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, is common in children with intestinal failure on home parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Moreover, metabolic bone disease can be predicted by duration of parenteral nutrition dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In a study of children with intestinal failure (40 percent of whom were on parenteral nutrition), 34 percent had metabolic bone disease, defined as bone mineral density less than -2.0 standard deviations (SD), measured during mid-childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Poor growth was a predictor of bone disease, but the proportion of nutrition provided enterally was not. Low serum calcium was an independent predictor of low bone mineral density, and vitamin D deficiency was common. Together, these findings suggest that optimizing vitamin D status is important to maintain bone health in children with SBS. </p><p>To monitor for bone disease in at-risk patients, serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, calcium, and inorganic phosphorus (Pi) should be measured every three months during the first year after parenteral nutrition has been discontinued, in addition to monitoring levels of the other nutrients listed above. Bone disease associated with SBS usually is characterized by low or normal Pi with elevated PTH, indicating deficiencies in vitamin D <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium. Supplementation of calcium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitamin D may be required to ensure that the recommended daily intake for each of these nutrients is met. Patients with vitamin D deficiency may require high doses to replace and maintain vitamin D sufficiency. In our SBS patients, we strive to maintain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. Concentrated enteral supplements of vitamin D are often tolerated even by patients on minimal oral or enteral feeds (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children&quot;, section on 'Nutritional rickets'</a>). Patients with low Pi but normal PTH may have phosphopenic rickets, which is usually caused by renal phosphate wasting; clinically significant phosphorus malabsorption is rare in SBS.

DEXA should then be followed serially at an interval depending on risk factors and Z score (eg, every one year for patients with reduced bone mineral density [BMD], and every one to two years for those with a normal BMD and presence of risk factors). Research in this area is ongoing; a study in adults with SBS demonstrated that administration of human growth hormone might improve bone health, since it increased markers of bone turnover and stabilized femoral bone neck mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

If applicable, infants may trial breast milk if the mother has strictly eliminated dairy and soy products from her diet. These diet changes can often be difficult for the family and patient and are best made in collaboration with a dietician who specializes in SBS. For patients with severe allergic or eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, steroid therapy sometimes leads to clinical improvements in enteral tolerance, but this approach should be used cautiously due to potential side effects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3585396968\"><span class=\"h1\">DAIRY INTOLERANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactose intolerance should be considered in the SBS population when the patient presents with bloating, diarrhea, or intolerance of enteral feeds.

Collaboration with specialists in wound care or ostomy care can dramatically reduce ostomy complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H400958633\"><span class=\"h2\">Granulation tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulation tissue at a gastrostomy site can occur due to moisture or leakage, friction from mobility of the tube, or ill-fitting, low-profile (&quot;skin-level&quot;) gastrostomy devices.

Chemical cautery of the granulation tissue with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">silver nitrate</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107864\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107864 \">picture 3</a>) or treatment with 0.1 to 0.5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">triamcinolone</a> cream can also be used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3873857681\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin breakdown</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barrier cream (which protects the skin from moisture) should be applied around the ostomy to prevent skin breakdown from leaking stool. In patients with ileal disease or resection, bile acid diarrhea may lead to significant skin breakdown.

Risk factors include airway intubation, prolonged neonatal intensive care, gastroesophageal reflux, painful procedures (nasogastric tube insertion, endoscopy), fundoplication, chronic aspiration, and motility disorders that lead to retching and gagging. Many SBS patients have a history of prematurity and complicated neonatal courses during which oral feedings were delayed or interrupted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Chronic parenteral nutrition and enteral tube feedings may suppress hunger and appetite, further contributing to oral aversion. </p><p>Prevention of oral aversion involves instituting non-nutritive sucking and feeding therapy early in the course of SBS. Consultation with a feeding therapist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychologist as part of a multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation program is valuable. </p><p>For patients who can tolerate oral feedings, adjunctive therapy can include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyproheptadine</a>, which is an antihistamine that can be used as an appetite stimulant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Peptic ulcer disease should be treated aggressively as this can contribute to aversive behaviors. Parenteral and enteral nutrition should be cycled when possible, to help stimulate appetite and allow for time off of pumps and tubing connections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H20519158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Cycling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1189257854\"><span class=\"h1\">DENTAL DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental disorders such as dental caries are common in individuals with SBS. In addition, oral aversion may present an obstacle to routine tooth care because children may have difficulty tolerating the insertion of a tooth brush in the mouth. A study of adults with SBS in the United Kingdom identified high rates of oral caries and xerostomia (dry mouth); xerostomia is a risk factor for oral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Risk factors for these problems included hyperphagia, sugar-containing &quot;sip&quot; feeds or oral rehydration fluids, dehydration, and use of medications that cause dry mouth. Early referral to and ongoing monitoring by pediatric dentist is recommended. </p><p>Eruption of green or discolored teeth also has been described. The tooth discoloration is likely due to prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia during dental development, combined with other risk factors such as extreme low birth weight and antibiotic use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107865\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107865 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2827619532\"><span class=\"h1\">FINANCIAL BURDEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The healthcare costs for children with SBS are substantial. The estimated healthcare costs for infants with intestinal failure living in the United States average $505,000 in the first year of life and about $300,000 in subsequent years, based on an analysis in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. This complex population often requires prolonged hospitalizations for medical and surgical indications. The combination of these financial strains and a chronic medical condition often leads to social stressors that adversely affect family functioning. Multidisciplinary teams caring for SBS patients typically include social workers, who can help alleviate some of these strains by providing consultation and resources for financial, behavioral, and social support. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watery diarrhea is the most common early complication of short bowel syndrome (SBS) in children and may be associated with electrolyte disturbances. It is usually caused by excessive osmotic load in the small intestine. Occasionally, it is caused by malabsorbed bile salts in the colon (bile acid diarrhea). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Watery diarrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who require long-term parenteral nutrition are at risk of catheter-related sepsis and catheter breakage and occlusion. Proper instruction on the care of the catheter must be provided to minimize risks for infection and to maintain long-term central venous access. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Catheter-related complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who require long-term parenteral nutrition are at risk for development of cholestatic liver disease, known as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). Severe and progressive liver disease is most common in premature neonates and infants, especially infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) who undergo surgical treatment. To prevent or retard the development of liver disease in patients with SBS, the most important step is to maximize enteral feeding. There is increasing evidence that limiting the dose of soy-based intravenous (IV) lipid emulsion, or altering the type of lipid in the emulsion, may be helpful in preventing or treating IFALD. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hepatobiliary disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric hypersecretion commonly occurs after small bowel resection in infants and children, and primarily occurs during the first few months postoperatively. This results in increased fluid losses and increased acidity, which tends to inactivate pancreatic enzymes and interferes with nutrient absorption. For these reasons, a trial of acid-suppressing medications is often recommended in the early stages after resection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Esophagitis/Peptic ulcer disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SBS are prone to small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Clinical manifestations include an increase in energy requirement and weight loss, and exacerbation of diarrhea. SIBO is often diagnosed and treated empirically based on risk factors and symptoms. Treatment is usually with cyclical courses of antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Small intestine bacterial overgrowth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysmotility is common in patients with SBS, specifically those with a history of gastroschisis or intestinal dilatation. Clinical trials are needed to further define the diagnostic value of manometry in pediatric SBS. Treatment with prokinetic therapy may lead to improvements in enteral therapy in carefully selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H1013730781\" class=\"local\">'Dysmotility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with SBS are at greatest risk for nutrient deficiencies during and after the time that parenteral nutrition is discontinued. Vitamin and mineral concentrations should be measured at the time of parenteral nutrition discontinuation, then periodically as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108641 \">table 2</a>). Many children will require supplements to maintain adequate intake or levels of micronutrients. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Nutrient deficiencies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic bone disease and rickets'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders may be more frequent than previously recognized in the pediatric SBS population. Endoscopic evaluation may be warranted and has a high diagnostic yield. Treatment can involve elimination of milk and dairy products, use of an elemental (amino acid-based) enteral formula, or treatment with glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H2520804390\" class=\"local\">'Allergic and eosinophilic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anastomotic ulcers may develop at the site of an intestinal resection due to poor tissue perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypersecretion of gastric acid, and can cause occult or frank gastrointestinal bleeding, often leading to anemia. Surgical resection of the ulcerated site may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H1974857566\" class=\"local\">'Anastomic ulcers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin conditions are frequent complications in patients with SBS, especially related to gastrostomy tube site, ostomies or breakdown from excessive stool output. Involvement of clinicians skilled in wound or ostomy care is often necessary. (See <a href=\"#H3640584313\" class=\"local\">'Skin complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral aversion is a common finding in SBS. Preventative strategies should be initiated early in the course and may involve non-nutritive sucking and early feeding therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2391063742\" class=\"local\">'Oral aversion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dental disorders such as caries, decay, eruption of green or discolored teeth have been described in patients with SBS, particularly those with extreme low birth weight, antibiotic use, and prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. (See <a href=\"#H1189257854\" class=\"local\">'Dental disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The healthcare costs for children with SBS are substantial. Families often benefit from counseling and support to address financial and other burdens.
