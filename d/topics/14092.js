Delivery minimizes the risk of development of serious maternal and fetal complications, such as cerebral hemorrhage, hepatic rupture, renal failure, pulmonary edema, seizure, bleeding related to thrombocytopenia, abruptio placenta, or fetal growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. With the exception of fetal growth restriction, any of these life-threatening complications can occur suddenly.

Conservative management allows administration of a course of antenatal corticosteroids and may provide time for further fetal growth and maturation. </p><p>For consideration of this approach, both the mother and fetus should be stable and hospitalized in a hospital with an appropriate level of newborn care, closely monitored, and cared for by, or in consultation with, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. We favor limiting conservative management to pregnancies &ge;24 weeks and &lt;34 weeks of gestation. Selection of appropriate candidates for this approach and management of these pregnancies are discussed separately.

This trial showed that women with preeclampsia benefited from early intervention, without incurring an increased risk of operative delivery or neonatal morbidity. Routine induction was associated with a 30 percent reduction in a composite of adverse maternal outcomes (31 versus 44 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86), which was primarily driven by a reduction in patients who developed severe hypertension and was not significant for women at 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</sup></span> to 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</sup></span> weeks. The induced group delivered, on average, 1.2 weeks earlier than the control group and had a significantly lower rate of cesarean delivery (14 versus 19 percent). There were no significant differences between groups in neonatal outcome. The composite included maternal mortality, maternal morbidity (eclampsia, HELLP syndrome [Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count], pulmonary edema, thromboembolic disease, placental abruption), progression to severe hypertension or proteinuria, and major postpartum hemorrhage. The trial was not large enough to determine whether small differences in newborn outcomes or induction between 36 and 37 weeks might be statistically significant.</p><p>Follow-up analyses showed that an unfavorable cervix was not a reason to avoid induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In a secondary analysis of data from this trial and DIGITAT (pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction), induction of labor at term in women with a median Bishop score of 3 (range 1 to 6) was not associated with a higher rate of cesarean delivery than conservative management, and approximately 85 percent of women in both groups achieved a vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Prostaglandins or a balloon catheter were used for cervical ripening.</p><p>In addition, an economic analysis of the HYPITAT trial (conducted in from the Netherlands) concluded induction was 11 percent less costly overall than expectant management with monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Management of delivery is reviewed below.

When mother and fetus are stable and without findings of serious end-organ dysfunction, a conservative approach with close monitoring for evidence of progression to the severe end of the disease spectrum is reasonable to achieve further fetal growth and maturity. However, at any gestational age, evidence of severe hypertension, serious maternal end-organ dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975 \">table 2</a>), or nonreassuring tests of fetal well-being are generally an indication for prompt delivery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&lt;34 weeks of gestation</strong> &ndash; Prior to 34<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</sup></span> weeks, guidelines from major medical organizations generally recommend conservative management of preeclampsia without features of severe disease, based on expert opinion, given the high risk of complications of prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7</a>]. We concur with this approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>34 to 36 weeks of gestation</strong> &ndash; The optimum management for women with preeclampsia without features of severe disease and stable maternal and fetal condition at 34<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</sup></span> to 36<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</span> </sup>weeks is uncertain. Although there are serious maternal risks with conservative management, we believe conservative management is reasonable in fully informed patients because the absolute maternal risk of an adverse outcome is low and the neonatal benefits of delivery at term are substantial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Data from the randomized HYPITAT-II trial and observational studies indicate that most patients with late-onset preterm disease will reach term without developing an adverse maternal outcome (thromboembolic disease, pulmonary edema, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, placental abruption, maternal death). In HYPITAT-II, which included women with non-severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation, at least one of the above adverse outcomes occurred in 1.2 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(2/165)</span> of the immediate delivery group versus 2.5 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(4/159)</span> of the expectant management group, with no maternal deaths or cases of pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Newborns benefited from the extra time in utero: neonates in the immediate delivery group had a higher frequency of respiratory distress (5.7 versus 1.7 percent in the conservative monitoring group, relative risk [RR] 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-8.2).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703219\"><span class=\"h2\">Components of conservative management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Inpatient versus outpatient care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Close maternal monitoring upon diagnosis of preeclampsia is important to establish disease severity and the rate of progression. Hospitalization is useful for making these assessments and facilitates rapid intervention in the event of rapid progression. After the initial diagnostic evaluation, outpatient care is a cost-effective option for women with stable preeclampsia without severe features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. Patients offered outpatient monitoring should be able to comply with frequent maternal and fetal evaluations (every one to three days) and should have ready access to medical care.</p><p>Outpatient care can be provided in the patient&rsquo;s home or, where available, at an antenatal day care unit, which is a common approach in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If signs or symptoms of disease progression are noted, hospitalization for more intensive monitoring and possible delivery is indicated.</p><p>There are limited data on outcome of outpatient management of women with preeclampsia. An observational study and a randomized trial reported good outcomes, but these studies had too few subjects to detect clinically significant differences in outcome between inpatient and outpatient management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A systematic review of three trials with a total of 504 women with various complications of pregnancy observed no major differences in clinical outcomes for mothers or infants between antenatal day units or hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1351217003\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women with preeclampsia should be aware of the signs and symptoms at the severe end of the disease spectrum and should monitor fetal movements daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If a woman develops severe or persistent headache, visual changes, shortness of breath, or right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, she should call her health care provider immediately. As with any pregnancy, decreased fetal movement, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, rupture of membranes, or uterine contractions should be reported immediately, as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3921652962\"><span class=\"h3\">Activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strict bedrest is unnecessary as there is no evidence that bedrest improves pregnancy outcome or delays progression of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, bedrest in hospitalized pregnant women has been associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Restricted activity is often recommended since blood pressure is lower in rested patients. Resting in the left lateral decubitus position can augment uteroplacental flow, which may benefit pregnancies in which this is a concern. In all pregnant women, avoiding the supine sleep position can have favorable fetal effects and appears prudent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minimum laboratory evaluation should include platelet count, serum creatinine, and liver enzymes. These tests should be repeated at least weekly in women with preeclampsia without severe features to assess for disease progression, and more often if clinical signs and symptoms suggest worsening disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Although other laboratory abnormalities may occur (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2379046844\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Potential laboratory findings'</a>), the value of monitoring additional laboratory tests is less clear. A rising hematocrit can be useful to look for hemoconcentration, which suggests contraction of intravascular volume and progression to more severe disease, while a falling hematocrit may be a sign of hemolysis. An elevated serum indirect bilirubin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LDH concentration is a better marker for hemolysis. Hemolysis can be confirmed by observation of schistocytes and helmet cells on a blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851%7EHEME%2F50715\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 graphicRef50715 \">picture 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since several clinical studies have shown that neither the rate of increase nor the amount of proteinuria affects maternal or perinatal outcome in the setting of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>], repeated urinary protein estimations are not useful once the threshold of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours or random urine <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> ratio &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> for the diagnosis of preeclampsia has been exceeded. At that point, serum creatinine alone can be used to monitor renal function. It is the practice of some providers, including the authors, to confirm a low positive protein creatinine ratio (0.3 to 0.6) with a 24-hour collection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proteinuria-in-pregnancy-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proteinuria in pregnancy: Evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=expectant-management-of-preeclampsia-with-severe-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Expectant management of preeclampsia with severe features&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure should be measured at least twice weekly in outpatients. The use of antihypertensive drugs to control mild hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &lt;110 mmHg) in the setting of preeclampsia does not alter the course of the disease or diminish perinatal morbidity or mortality, and should be avoided in most patients. It does, however, reduce the occurrence of progression to severe hypertension. The indications for starting antihypertensive therapy, the choice of drug, and blood pressure goals are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypertension in preeclampsia'</a>.)</p><p>Sodium restriction below the recommended daily intake and diuretics have no role in routine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Although intravascular vascular volume is reduced, a randomized trial showed that plasma volume expansion did not improve maternal or fetal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Diuretics are only indicated for treatment of pulmonary edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2654865169\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of fetal growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early fetal growth restriction may be the first manifestation of preeclampsia and is a sign of severe uteroplacental insufficiency. At the time of diagnosis of preeclampsia, we perform sonography to estimate fetal weight and assess amniotic fluid volume for evaluation of fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios. If the initial examination is normal, we repeat the ultrasound examination every three weeks. Management of the growth restricted fetus is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of fetal well-being</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data from randomized trials on which to base recommendations for the optimal type and frequency of antepartum fetal monitoring. We suggest daily fetal movement counts and twice weekly nonstress testing plus assessment of amniotic fluid volume, or twice weekly biophysical profiles, beginning at the time of diagnosis of preeclampsia. Fetal testing is repeated promptly if there is an abrupt change in maternal condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-fetal-biophysical-profile\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The fetal biophysical profile&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of umbilical artery Doppler indices is useful if fetal growth restriction is suspected, as the results help in optimal timing of delivery. In a meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials in high-risk pregnancies (n = 10,225 infants), knowledge of umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry resulted in a 29 percent reduction in perinatal death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98; 1.2 versus 1.7 percent; number needed to treat 203, 95% CI 103-4352), primarily in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The frequency of assessment depends on the findings; weekly assessment is reasonable when Doppler indices are normal.

Antenatal corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a>) to promote fetal lung maturity should be administered to women &lt;34 weeks of gestation since they are at increased risk of progression to severe disease and preterm delivery. A course of steroids is administered when the clinician believes delivery within the next seven days is likely and neonatal resuscitation is planned. Use of steroids after 34 weeks is more complicated and discussed separately.

For example, cesarean delivery may be recommended for women with preeclampsia with severe features who are less than 32 weeks of gestation and have an unfavorable cervical examination, given the relatively high frequency of abnormal fetal heart rate tracings and low likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery (less than 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrapartum monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous maternal-fetal monitoring is indicated intrapartum to identify worsening hypertension; deteriorating maternal hepatic, renal, cardiopulmonary, neurologic, or hematologic function; abruptio placenta; or an abnormal fetal heart rate tracing.

Timing of delivery is based upon gestational age, the severity of preeclampsia, and maternal and fetal condition. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia with features of severe disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76975 \">table 2</a>) is generally regarded as an indication for delivery, regardless of gestational age, given the high risk of serious maternal morbidity. However, prolonged antepartum management in a tertiary care setting or in consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist is an option for selected women remote from term (&lt;34 weeks of gestation). (See <a href=\"#H31268927\" class=\"local\">'Preeclampsia with features of severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihypertensive therapy is indicated for treatment of persistent severe hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &ge;160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &ge;110 mmHg) to prevent stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110261\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110261 \">table 3</a>); it does not prevent eclampsia. Antihypertensive therapy to control mild hypertension does not alter the course of preeclampsia or diminish perinatal morbidity or mortality, and should be avoided in most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypertension in preeclampsia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with preeclampsia without features of severe disease, we suggest conservative management with delivery when the pregnancy has reached 37 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preeclampsia without features of severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expectant management of women with preeclampsia without features of severe disease consists of frequent laboratory monitoring (platelet count, liver and renal function tests), assessment of maternal blood pressure and symptoms, and evaluation of fetal growth and well-being. In most patients, antihypertensive therapy is not indicated for systolic blood pressure &lt;160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &lt;110 mmHg. (See <a href=\"#H703219\" class=\"local\">'Components of conservative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a viable fetus and preeclampsia &lt;34 weeks of gestation, we recommend a course of antenatal glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Use of steroids at 34 to 36 weeks is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on '22+0 to 33+6 weeks'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on '34+0 or more weeks'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with preeclampsia and features of severe disease, we recommend intrapartum and postpartum seizure prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The benefit of seizure prophylaxis is less clear in women without severe hypertension or preeclampsia symptoms; however, we also suggest intrapartum and postpartum prophylaxis for these women (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We recommend the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> as a first-line agent for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Seizure prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We give a loading dose of 6 g <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> intravenously over 15 to 20 minutes followed by 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/hour</span> as a continuous infusion. The maintenance dose is only given when a patellar reflex is present (loss of reflexes is the first manifestation of symptomatic hypermagnesemia), respirations exceed 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute,</span> and urine output exceeds 100 mL over four hours. (See <a href=\"#H704368\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maintenance dose (but not the loading dose) should be adjusted in women with renal insufficiency. We use 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/hour</span> if the serum creatinine is &gt;1.2 and &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (106 to 221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and no maintenance dose if the serum creatinine is &ge;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H2098669845\" class=\"local\">'Renal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnesium toxicity is uncommon in women with good renal function. Toxicity is related to serum magnesium concentration: loss of deep tendon reflexes occurs at 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (8.5 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 3.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respiratory paralysis at 10 to 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (12 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 5.0 to 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> cardiac conduction is altered at &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (&gt;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or &gt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and cardiac arrest occurs at &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or &gt;12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical assessment for magnesium toxicity should be performed every one to two hours. We obtain serum magnesium levels every six hours as an adjunct to clinical assessment in patients who have a seizure while receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>, clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> suggestive of magnesium toxicity, or renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3569292497\" class=\"local\">'When to check magnesium levels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcium gluconate</a> 15 to 30 mL of a 10 percent solution intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes is administered to women with cardiac arrest or severe cardiac toxicity related to hypermagnesemia. A starting dose of 10 mL of a 10 percent solution is used for patients with less severe but life-threatening cardiorespiratory compromise. (See <a href=\"#H3881337876\" class=\"local\">'Antidote'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For severely thrombocytopenic patients, we notify the blood bank and have platelets readily available for transfusion in case excessive bleeding develops at vaginal delivery or excessive oozing is observed at the time of skin incision at cesarean. The decision for prophylactic platelet transfusion in women with severe preeclampsia-related thrombocytopenia but no excessive bleeding depends on patient-specific factors; consultation with the hematology service may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H1101611232\" class=\"local\">'Management of thrombocytopenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid balance should be monitored closely to avoid excessive administration, which can lead to pulmonary edema. A maintenance infusion of a balanced salt or isotonic saline solution at about 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> is often adequate. Oliguria that does not respond to a modest trial of increased fluids (eg, a 300 mL fluid challenge) suggests renal insufficiency and should be tolerated to reduce the potential for iatrogenic pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H961072\" class=\"local\">'Fluids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increased risk of preeclampsia recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. Early-onset preeclampsia with severe features has a higher risk of recurrence than milder disease with onset at term. (See <a href=\"#H21332929\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Heart Association considers a history of preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension a major risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease (see <a href=\"#H21332973\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above). Routine well-woman care should include assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, with appropriate patient monitoring and risk reduction interventions, when indicated.
