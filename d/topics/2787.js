An international study of cancer registries reported that, between the years 1980 to 1994, cancer occurred in 25,044 of 831,804 dialysis patients (compared with an expected number of 21,185), resulting in an overall standardized cancer incidence of 1.18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

As an example, the United States Renal Data Survey (USRDS) 2007 annual report found that cancer was responsible for approximately seven deaths per 1000 patient-years at risk for period prevalent patients for 2003 to 2005 combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; by comparison, cardiac arrest resulted in approximately 38 deaths per 1000 patient-years at risk at this same period. Thus, the high rates of cardiovascular and infectious causes of death in dialysis patients make death from cancer less likely.</p><p>The incidence of death from malignancy also varies with dialysis vintage, age, and concurrent comorbid conditions. As an example, the death rates for those of dialysis vintage of more than three years is higher than patients who have undergone dialysis for less than three years (9 versus 6.5 deaths per 1000 patient years at risk, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Malignancy is more common among hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>], approximately three times higher in dialysis patients over age 65 years (except in the Taiwanese studies) compared with younger patients, and lower in diabetic patients, probably due to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and other causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CANCER SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of screening to permit early discovery of a malignancy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) must be weighed against the costs of screening large numbers of individuals with low overall survival rates due to considerable mortality from nonmalignant causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One cost-effectiveness analysis compared cancer screening in patients with ESRD with screening in the general population and examined the screening benefits of mammography, Papanicolaou tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Each test was assumed to have 100 percent sensitivity and specificity, and, if detected, cancer was assumed to be instantly treated and cured. These assumptions biased the study in favor of cancer screening in general. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The costs per unit of survival benefit conferred by cancer screening were 1.6 to 19.3 times greater among patients with ESRD compared with the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The net gain of life expectancy in patients with ESRD via these screening programs was calculated to be <strong>five days</strong> or less. Similar survival gains could be obtained by reducing the baseline ESRD mortality rate by 0.02 percent.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that routine cancer screening in the ESRD population did <strong>not</strong> represent an efficient allocation of financial resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar findings were reported in a study evaluating the efficacy of breast and cervical cancer screening of Canadian women undergoing maintenance dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In 2012, as part of Choosing Wisely: An initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, the American Society of Nephrology recommended against routine cancer screening in patients on dialysis with &quot;limited life expectancy and without signs or symptoms&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>However, the conclusion that routine cancer screening not be performed among ESRD patients is tempered when applied to patients of varying age, differing comorbidity, multiple risk factors for particular malignancies, and race. As an example, the enhanced survival among African Americans on dialysis must be considered when contemplating cancer-screening protocols. One study using different databases, as well as a real-time life expectancy calculator, found that the number of potential days of life &quot;saved&quot; when screening patients with ESRD for cancer varied based upon individual characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. With breast cancer, for example, 41 to 291 potential days could be saved by screening a 50-year-old black woman, while only 1 to 16 days would be saved with a 60-year-old white woman with diabetes mellitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Colorectal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple tests are available as options for colorectal cancer screening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The specificity of screening for colon cancer among patients with ESRD differs from the general population because dialysis patients have a higher incidence of nonmalignant gastrointestinal abnormalities. A positive stool guaiac test, for example, occurs at a higher frequency in dialysis patients due to an increased incidence of gastritis, gastrointestinal telangiectasias, and other causes of gastrointestinal blood loss. In one series, the incidence of guaiac-positive stools was three times higher in asymptomatic dialysis patients compared with non-ESRD controls (15 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the presence of a positive stool guaiac test in an asymptomatic individual with ESRD may permit the early discovery of a colorectal malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The decision to screen for colorectal cancer should be individualized since it may be appropriate in specific patients. In a study of nearly 470,000 Medicare beneficiaries &ge;50 years of age who received dialysis between January 2007 and September 2012, 11.6 percent of patients underwent a colon cancer screening test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Screening was more likely to occur among patients at the lowest risk for mortality and those most likely to be transplanted. However, absolute rates of colon cancer screening were high, suggesting that overscreening was likely still occurring. These findings emphasize the importance of individualized colon cancer screening among dialysis patients, focused on expected survival, transplant potential, and risks for colon cancer, and discourage the use of &quot;routine&quot; screening protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostate cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is ongoing controversy regarding the benefit of early detection of prostate cancer via measurement of the serum PSA concentration in the general population. The cancers that are detected by serum PSA screening as opposed to physical examination or symptom development are of an earlier stage, but a survival benefit from earlier treatment has not yet been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A higher incidence of prostate cancer among patients with ESRD has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Serum PSA levels do not appear to be affected by renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and some clinicians advocate periodic serum PSA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, as noted above, evidence suggests that screening these patients for prostate cancer using serum PSA is <strong>not</strong> cost effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25</a>].

The authors suggested that it may be prudent to limit use of PSA screening to dialysis patients with a life expectancy of at least 10 years or more and ensure adequate discussion of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of screening in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of cervical cancer among ESRD patients is approximately 2.5 to 4 times that in the normal population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3,4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,13</a>]. This higher risk is due primarily to the increased presence of the human papilloma virus (HPV) in this patient population.</p><p>The recognition of HPV as an etiologic factor in the development of cervical cancer led to the use of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to Papanicolaou (Pap) smear as a screen and predictor of risk for cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and, subsequently, to the development of a vaccine that protects against the HPV types responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancers and 90 percent of genital warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Although most investigators have found high false-positive rates with these markers, particularly CA 50 and CA 19-9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], others have observed these markers to be accurate and useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serum concentrations of CA 125 are used in the diagnosis and treatment of women with ovarian cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-chemotherapy-for-advanced-stage-iii-or-iv-epithelial-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-line chemotherapy for advanced (stage III or IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal cancer&quot;</a>). However, this marker is a less accurate indicator of disease burden in women undergoing peritoneal dialysis since serum levels may increase as a result of nonspecific peritoneal irritation or peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Furthermore, a sudden decrease in the effluent CA 125 concentration may signal the development of inflammation (peritonitis) or sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-screening-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Until further information is available, it is reasonable to question the efficacy of carbohydrate markers in patients with ESRD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practice guidelines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> standards for cancer screening that have been developed in the general population are not necessarily applicable to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Given the limited information about cancer screening that is available, routine screening cannot be advocated for all such patients. Routine cancer screening is perhaps most inappropriate in patients with ESRD who are diabetic, white, or &ge;65 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cancer screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer-screening protocols are best implemented on an individual patient basis, a setting in which personal risk factors (family history, comorbid diseases, etc) may be considered. Patients being considered for renal transplantation should undergo routine cancer screening as part of the transplant evaluation process.
