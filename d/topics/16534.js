It was subsequently discovered that sulfasalazine was also efficacious in treating inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis. The 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) medications were developed because many patients were intolerant of or allergic to sulfasalazine.</p><p>This topic will review the pharmacology of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> and 5-ASAs, mechanism of action in inflammatory bowel disease, and side effects.

Sulfasalazine is partially absorbed in the jejunum after oral ingestion. The remainder passes into the colon, where it is reduced by coliform bacterial enzyme, azoreductase, to sulfapyridine and 5-ASA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The majority of absorbed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> is excreted into bile; only a small fraction is excreted in the urine. 5-ASA is poorly absorbed from the colon and is largely excreted in the stool. Sulfapyridine is rapidly absorbed from the colon, metabolized by the liver, and excreted in the urine with only small amounts remaining in the stool.</p><p>5-ASA is primarily responsible for the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, while sulfapyridine accounts for many of its side effects. Unconjugated 5-ASA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>) does not have the side effects associated with sulfapyridine, but is rapidly absorbed in the jejunum, allowing only 20 percent to reach the terminal ileum and colon. Therefore, a number of 5-ASA compounds have been developed to prevent absorption of 5-ASA in the proximal gastrointestinal tract, and thereby increase delivery to the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86818 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194953227\"><span class=\"h2\">5-ASA formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral 5-ASA formulations differ in their mode of delivery of the active drug to the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86818 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The systemic absorption and efficacy are comparable to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, and 5-ASAs are better tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. There does not appear to be any difference in efficacy or safety between the various formulations of oral 5-ASAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therefore, the choice of oral 5-ASA for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease should be based on the indication (eg, induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis), disease location, patient preference, ability to comply with the prescribed dosing regimen, and availability of the drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Left-sided colitis, extensive colitis, and pancolitis'</a>.)</p><p>The following oral 5-ASA formulations have been developed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dimerization of 5-ASA has been used to develop prodrug formulations <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olsalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olsalazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balsalazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">balsalazide</a>. Olsalazine consists of two 5-ASAs joined together with an azo bond, while balsalazide consists of one 5-ASA linked to an inert unabsorbed carrier molecule. As colonic bacteria are required to cleave the azo bond and release the 5-ASA moiety, these formulations are active only in the colon. Olsalazine is administered orally twice daily. Balsalazide is available in two formulations, which are administered orally two to three times a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed- and controlled-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a> formulations consist of single 5-ASA molecules enclosed within an enteric coat or a semipermeable membrane that resists gastric breakdown.</p><p/><p>In delayed-release formulations, the release of 5-ASA is pH-dependent. The acrylic-base resin dissolves at a pH &ge;7, delivering 10 to 15 percent of 5-ASA to the terminal ileum and remainder in the colon. In controlled-release formulations, the release of 5-ASA is time-dependant and independent of pH. The ethylcellulose coating serves as a semipermeable membrane that releases 30 to 40 percent of 5-ASA in the duodenum and continues release throughout the small intestine and colon. Delayed-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a> is administered orally one to three times daily, and controlled-release mesalamine is administered orally four times daily. However, there are data for many formulations that they can be prescribed once a day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extended-release forms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a> contain mesalamine granules encased in microcrystalline cellulose that delivers mesalamine to the colon via a proprietary extended-release mechanism.

MMX-mesalamine has a comparable efficacy and safety profile to other 5-ASA formulations, and has the advantage of once daily dosing and possibly improved compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p/><p>A number of topical formulations of 5-ASA are also available and are discussed in detail separately.

In vitro investigations have identified many antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of 5-ASA, suggesting a multifactorial basis of therapeutic action. The following mechanisms have been proposed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H382461902\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhibition of cytokine synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Downregulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) has been shown to be involved in inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Enhanced mucosal production of proinflammatory cytokines has also been correlated with active inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. 5-ASA medications may exert their anti-inflammatory effect by inducing PPAR-gamma gene expression and that of its target genes and suppressing the activation of cytokine NF&kappa;B and toll-like receptors (TLRs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. 5-ASAs, and to some extent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, also inhibit the biologic functions of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), IL-2, IL-8, and NF kB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69910 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

Support for this proposed mechanism of action in inflammatory bowel disease was derived from preliminary trials with lipoxygenase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Although subsequent randomized trials have not demonstrated a clinical benefit in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, it is unclear if this lack of efficacy was due to incomplete enzyme inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194952471\"><span class=\"h2\">Free radical scavenging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen mediate tissue injury via oxidation of cellular proteins. 5-ASA is a potent free radical scavenger and antioxidant at the concentrations achieved within the intestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sulfasalazine-and-5-aminosalicylates-in-the-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H194952450\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since orally ingested unconjugated 5-ASA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>) undergoes rapid absorption in the jejunum, various formulations have been developed to prevent proximal absorption of 5-ASA and increase bioavailability in the distal small bowel and colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86818 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H194953227\" class=\"local\">'5-ASA formulations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5-ASA preparations are as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and are better tolerated. Therefore, initial treatment choice should be based on the indication (eg, induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis), disease location, patient preference, ability to comply with the prescribed dosing regimen, and availability of the drug. (See <a href=\"#H194953227\" class=\"local\">'5-ASA formulations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5-ASAs have antiinflammatory properties and are thought to act topically. Several different mechanisms of action have been proposed, including inhibition of cytokine, prostaglandin, and leukotriene synthesis, free radical scavenging, immunosuppressive activity, and impairment of white cell adhesion and function. (See <a href=\"#H194952457\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 5-ASA compounds are generally better tolerated than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>. Common side effects of sulfasalazine and 5-ASAs include nausea and headache. Sulfasalazine has been associated with male infertility and, rarely, agranulocytosis. Transient mild watery diarrhea can occur in patients on all oral 5-ASA preparations. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olsalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olsalazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balsalazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">balsalazide</a> can cause persistent watery diarrhea. Approximately 3 percent of patients on oral 5-ASA have a paradoxical worsening of their colitis symptoms with diarrhea, bleeding, and acute abdominal pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64059\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64059 \">table 3</a>). These patients should be considered allergic to 5-ASAs, and 5-ASAs should no longer be used.
