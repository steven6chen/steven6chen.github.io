But central cord syndrome can also occur when the spinal cord is damaged lower down. Central cord syndrome in the neck causes symptoms in the arms and the upper part of the chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83608 \">figure 1</a>). People with the condition usually lose some of their ability to sense pain or temperature changes in those body parts. This lack of sensation can affect a person's ability to use his or her hands and arms. Plus, the person's arms and hands might become weak. In severe cases, the person might have trouble walking and have problems with bladder control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537584830\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes central cord syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central cord syndrome can happen because of an injury involving the neck, or a tumor in the spinal cord. It can also happen in people who have a form of neck arthritis called cervical spondylosis. This is especially likely if they extend their neck too far, as they might during a whiplash injury.</p><p>In people with cervical spondylosis, the bones that make up the spine (called the vertebrae) start to wear down. Then they form bumps called bone spurs, which bulge into hollow space where the spinal cord normally sits. As a result, the space for the spinal cord gets smaller. In severe cases or with a neck injury, the bone spurs can squeeze the spinal cord and damage it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537584845\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you suddenly develop the symptoms of central cord syndrome, see a doctor or nurse right away. If the symptoms develop suddenly after a fall or injury, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537584860\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you suddenly develop the symptoms of central cord syndrome, you will need an imaging test, such as an MRI or a CT scan. These tests create detailed pictures of the inside of the body. They can show where the spinal cord is being squeezed or injured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537584875\"><span class=\"h1\">How is central cord syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your central cord syndrome.</p><p>If your central cord syndrome is related to cervical spondylosis, your doctor might recommend surgery to remove the bone spurs pressing on your spinal cord. He or she might also give you medicines called steroids. These steroids are different than the steroids athletes take to build up muscle. These steroids can help reduce swelling in the spinal cord so that it has less permanent damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537584890\"><span class=\"h1\">Can central cord syndrome be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. If you have severe cervical spondylosis, your doctor might recommend steps to prevent neck injuries. Here are some things you can do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid heavy lifting, active sports, slippery floors, and any activities that put you at risk of falling. Also avoid activities that involve moving your neck a lot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure the headrest in your car is positioned at the back of your head, in the right place to keep your head from slamming back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor if you should wear a neck brace.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537584905\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whiplash-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whiplash (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
