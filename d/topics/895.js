Additional concerns specific to craniotomy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic status</strong> &ndash; The patient's baseline neurologic status, including current and prior specific deficits, signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and history of seizures should be assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On emergence from anesthesia, new deficits may be cause for concern, while reappearance of prior deficits may represent differential emergence, and may resolve quickly. (See <a href=\"#H2653637192\" class=\"local\">'Differential emergence or awakening'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac status</strong> &ndash; When the risk of venous air embolism (VAE) is high (eg, sitting position, surgery near venous sinuses), we obtain an echocardiogram that includes a bubble study to rule out a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or other intracardiac shunt (eg, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect) and assess cardiac function; we consider a PFO a relative contraindication to the use of the sitting position. In addition, patients with pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction may decompensate with even small amounts of intravenous (IV) air. (See <a href=\"#H258394620\" class=\"local\">'Sitting position'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be performed after induction of anesthesia for cases with high risk of air embolism. In this setting, if intracardiac shunt is identified, the procedure can be performed in a position with less risk of air embolism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258395535\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As usual, the patient's medications should be reviewed; considerations in anticipation of craniotomy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticonvulsants</strong> &ndash; Many patients who undergo craniotomy are taking anticonvulsants, which can affect metabolism of a variety of drugs. Patients should be instructed to take the usual dose of anticonvulsant the morning of surgery, unless the patient is to undergo seizure focus mapping and resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> &ndash; Patients with intracranial masses may be taking glucocorticoids. Stress-dose glucocorticoids may be required before induction of anesthesia, and blood glucose may be elevated in patients taking these medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticoagulants</strong> &ndash; In most cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and other medications that affect coagulation should be discontinued in advance of craniotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Medications affecting hemostasis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Estimating procedural bleeding risk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258395542\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting for craniotomy may have fluid and electrolyte abnormalities because of poor oral intake, glucocorticoid or diuretic administration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> centrally mediated endocrine abnormalities. Measurement of blood glucose, electrolytes, and complete blood count should be performed. Other preoperative blood tests, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed when indicated, as for other major surgery.

(See <a href=\"#H8564882\" class=\"local\">'Neurophysiologic monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75134381\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the indication, most craniotomies follow standard steps that affect anesthetic management. Periods of intense, painful stimulus are separated by relatively long periods of low-level stimulation, requiring adjustment of anesthetic depth.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skull pinning</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The head is usually immobilized with the Mayfield apparatus, which consists of skull pins fixed to a clamp that is firmly attached to the operating table. The pins are placed through the skin and scalp, and into the outer table of the skull.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pinning is a brief, sudden, and painful stimulus comparable to incision or laryngoscopy that can result in hypertension and tachycardia. To attenuate this hemodynamic response, various medications can be administered in anticipation of pinning, including opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 50 to 100 mcg intravenously [IV] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> 25 to 50 mcg IV), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (eg, 20 to 50 mg IV), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> (0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (eg, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Administration of opioids at the higher doses in these ranges can result in hypotension after the stimulus of pinning is over, particularly if administered with propofol. Timing of pinning should be coordinated with the surgeon to allow effective pretreatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We usually administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) and opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 100 mcg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> 50 mcg IV) approximately one minute prior to pinning. A small dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (eg, 20 to 50 mg IV) may be added depending on the patient's hemodynamic status and risk factors for subsequent hypotension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Local anesthetic infiltration at the pin sites or scalp block may be performed to prevent the hemodynamic response to skull pinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve blocks of the scalp, neck, and trunk: Techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-blocks-of-the-scalp-neck-and-trunk-techniques#H520467515\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve blocks of the scalp, neck, and trunk: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Scalp block'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preincision preparation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>After skull pinning, a light level of anesthesia is required for a variable, potentially long period of time during supplementary line placement, patient positioning, registration of the stereotactic guidance system, sterile skin preparation, and draping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incision, raising scalp and bone flaps</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Before incision, the level of anesthesia should be increased. Blood loss can be significant while the scalp flap is raised and may be hidden on the drapes or in a collection bag. Brain relaxation may be required prior to dural opening. (See <a href=\"#H8564183\" class=\"local\">'Brain relaxation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Opening the dura</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The parietal dura is rich in pain fibers; manipulation of the dura is intensely painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and requires continuation of a relatively deep level of anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracranial procedure</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Depending on the indication and location of the pathology, the procedure may be brief and superficial (eg, evacuation of subdural hematoma) or lengthy with microscopic dissection (eg, clipping of a cerebral aneurysm). A lighter level of anesthesia may be required during the intracranial portion of surgery because brain tissue has no pain receptors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wound closure </strong>&ndash; After completion of the intracranial procedure, hemostasis is achieved, followed by dural closure, replacement of the bone, and scalp closure. For extensive craniotomies, closure can take an hour or more. Although not as stimulating as incision, wound closure is painful. Opioids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antihypertensive medication may be required as the anesthetic is lightened for emergence. (See <a href=\"#H8564274\" class=\"local\">'Emergence from anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1228133176\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General endotracheal anesthesia is the preferred technique for craniotomy, though for specific indications, the procedure can be performed awake. (See <a href=\"#H8564396\" class=\"local\">'Awake craniotomy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8564068\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors (ie, electrocardiogram [ECG], blood pressure [BP], pulse oximetry, temperature, oxygen analyzer, continuous end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO<sub>2</sub>] analyzer) may be sufficient in select, minimally invasive craniotomies (eg, burr holes for subdural hematoma evacuation). In most cases, additional monitoring is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H254392428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Preparation for anesthetic induction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336791465\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial catheterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous BP monitoring with an intraarterial catheter is indicated for all patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and for patients who undergo cerebrovascular procedures. Arterial catheterization is helpful for most other craniotomies, allowing optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and assessment of volume status, and facilitating blood sampling for blood gases and electrolytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1294928143\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring for venous air embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous air embolism (VAE) can occur whenever the operative site is positioned above the level of heart, as it usually is for craniotomy. VAE is a relatively common and potentially serious complication of craniotomy in the sitting position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but it can occur with other positions. VAE can occur during a variety of intracranial procedures, including tumor resection or skull opening along venous sinuses, and has occurred at skull pin sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H258394620\" class=\"local\">'Sitting position'</a> below.)</p><p>Monitors for VAE include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Precordial Doppler</strong> &ndash; The precordial Doppler is the most commonly used method for VAE monitoring. It is simple to perform, is very sensitive for VAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (though not specific for air), and provides continuous monitoring with an audible signal, allowing other tasks to be performed by the anesthesiologist. The Doppler signal may be difficult to obtain in the lateral and prone positions, in morbidly obese patients, and in patients with COPD and increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Doppler probe is taped in place on the patient's chest along the right or left parasternal border at the third to sixth intercostal space, where the best signal intensity is heard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A change in the character and intensity of the baseline Doppler sound to a high-pitched &quot;whoosh&quot; is indicative of air embolism. We confirm correct placement of the Doppler probe by injecting 10 mL of agitated saline through the central venous catheter (CVC) or peripheral intravenous (IV) line, listening for an obvious change in Doppler tone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)</strong> &ndash; TEE is the most sensitive method for detection of VAE, though it is not specific to VAE (ie, it cannot differentiate VAE from other types of embolism such as fat, bone, etc).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The TEE probe is placed in the esophagus after induction of anesthesia. It can be used to assess for patent foramen ovale (PFO) and for accurate placement of a CVC for air aspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-transesophageal-echocardiography-for-noncardiac-surgery#H28430530\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography for noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Neurosurgery with high risk of venous air embolism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TEE should not be used in patients with esophageal pathology. The safety of TEE in long cases with the neck flexed has not been established. TEE is not usually used during prone craniotomy, since it is difficult to maintain the probe in the optimal position or manipulate the probe for diagnostics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography: Indications, complications, and normal views&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ETCO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Continuous ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is performed for all patients under general anesthesia. A decrease in ETCO<sub>2 </sub>by &ge;0.5 percent can indicate embolism of as little as 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, a decrease in ETCO<sub>2</sub> is nonspecific for VAE, especially when hypotension occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8564882\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurophysiologic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potential monitoring during craniotomy have implications for the choice of anesthetic medication. These monitoring modalities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336791183\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracranial pressure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may have an extraventricular drain (EVD) placed prior to or during craniotomy. An EVD may be used to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to monitor ICP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast with arterial or central venous monitoring transducers, the EVD should <strong>not</strong> be connected to a pressure bag; dangerous increase in ICP can occur. Management of the EVD should be discussed with the surgeon before and during surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30914957\"><span class=\"h3\">Processed electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When total IV anesthesia (TIVA) is used, we use a processed EEG monitor (eg, bispectral index [BIS] or SedLine) to help guide the dose of anesthetic and to facilitate rapid emergence from anesthesia. EEG monitoring used for intraoperative neuromonitoring can be used as well to assess anesthetic depth, and to monitor intraoperative seizure activity. (See <a href=\"#H258395408\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous anesthesia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Awareness with recall following general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Neuromonitoring'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia#H3106192\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Electroencephalography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1294928156\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We place two IV catheters for most routine craniotomies.

(See <a href=\"#H8564488\" class=\"local\">'Management of venous air embolism'</a> below.)</p><p>For craniotomy with high risk of VAE, the CVC may be placed using internal jugular, subclavian, or antecubital veins. In this setting, the tip of the catheter is optimally placed at the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right atrium. Optimal placement should be confirmed before positioning for surgery, using one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chest radiograph</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>We perform a chest radiograph after central line placement, to confirm the position of the catheter tip and to rule out pneumothorax. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ECG</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>A unipolar ECG lead can be connected to a specially designed central line catheter connector and advanced until the P-wave becomes biphasic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The catheter is then withdrawn slightly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TEE</strong> &ndash; While using TEE, the catheter should be advanced until the tip appears in the right atrium and then withdrawn until it is just out of view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>A variety of catheters and insertion sites can be used for CVCs for air aspiration. We place CVCs for VAE via a right distal subclavian approach with ultrasound guidance. We use a quadruple-lumen, 16-gauge catheter, inserted fully unless arrhythmia occurs, adjusted, if necessary, based on the chest radiograph. Occasionally, a longer catheter is required to optimally position the tip at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. A 60-mL syringe attached to high-pressure tubing is connected to the catheter using a stopcock. IV fluid is infused continuously through the second stopcock port to prevent clotting of the catheter. If VAE occurs, the stopcock is turned to allow air aspiration.

Patients with intracranial pathology may be especially sensitive to sedatives and opioids; premedication should be titrated to effect using small doses of medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 1 to 2 mg IV, administered in 0.5-mg increments).

While ETCO<sub>2</sub> generally correlates well with PCO<sub>2</sub>, a number of factors (eg, age, lung disease, surgical positioning) can result in significant discrepancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>]. In our clinical experience, PCO<sub>2</sub> is commonly 8 to 10 mmHg higher than ETCO<sub>2</sub> in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though this difference is variable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vasoconstriction that accompanies hyperventilation may result in ischemia, particularly for at-risk brain tissue (eg, after TBI, after subarachnoid hemorrhage, or under surgical retractors during craniotomy). Hyperventilation to a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 25 to 30 mmHg can improve surgical conditions during supratentorial craniotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. However, multiple human and animal studies using a variety of methodologies have reported evidence of brain ischemia in injured brains with hyperventilation to a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 25 to 30 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Therefore, we believe that hyperventilation should be used only when indicated. As part of a multimodal approach to brain relaxation for surgical exposure, we hyperventilate as briefly as possible to achieve a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 30 to 35 mmHg.

If possible, adjustment of head rotation may improve venous drainage as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Intrathoracic pressure</strong> &ndash; Positive intrathoracic pressure impedes venous return to the right heart. If oxygenation permits, discontinuing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and adjusting the ventilator settings to decrease mean airway pressure may improve venous return.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Right heart function</strong> &ndash; If there is a decrease in right heart contractility, this could lead to an elevation of CVP and decrease in venous return. Therefore, any myocardial dysfunction, especially right heart failure, should be treated appropriately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is there cerebral vasodilation?</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hypercapnia</strong> &ndash; Increase in minute ventilation may reduce cerebral vasodilation, depending on the starting ETCO<sub>2</sub> and PCO<sub>2</sub>.

CSF should be drained in increments (eg, 5 to 10 mL at a time) with ongoing assessment of brain conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Is osmotherapy indicated?</strong> &ndash; If the steps above are ineffective, osmotherapy is indicated. For osmotherapy to treat intraoperative cerebral edema, we administer 0.8 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 3% NaCl, or 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 23.4% NaCl, over 15 to 20 minutes.

Mannitol causes an initial increase in intravascular volume followed by osmotic diuresis and net negative fluid balance. Mannitol should be avoided in patients who may not tolerate the initial increase in intravascular volume (eg, patients with congestive heart failure) or who cannot eliminate mannitol (eg, patients with renal dysfunction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>HTS</strong> &ndash; Three percent NaCl can be administered via a peripheral IV, while more concentrated solutions (ie, 7.5 and 23.4%) must be administered through a central venous catheter (CVC); except for emergent situations, HTS should be infused over 15 to 20 minutes. HTS causes a sustained increase in plasma volume. Concerns related to HTS therapy include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Rapid administration of HTS can result in hypervolemia and hypertension due to rapid expansion of blood volume; this is rarely of clinical concern in the operating room (OR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Rapid administration of HTS can cause acute elevation of serum sodium. As an example, administration of approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> of sodium (approximately 45 mL of 23.4% NaCl) over two minutes can increase plasma sodium from 140 to 152 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.

Goals for emergence include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minimal residual anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Ideally, a neurologic exam is performed at the end of the craniotomy before leaving the OR. Neuromuscular block should be fully reversed, and anesthetic agents used for maintenance should be at effect-site concentrations compatible with return of consciousness (eg, inhalation agents less than 0.2 MAC-equivalent<sub> </sub>end<sub> </sub>tidal concentration, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> titrated downward as surgery ends).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plan for postoperative pain control</strong> &ndash; In contrast with other surgical procedures, opioids should not be administered at a dose that is expected to prevent anticipated pain, but rather titrated as needed following extubation and neurologic exam.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, after stopping a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> infusion at the end of surgery, we usually perform a neurologic exam before administering a small dose of a short-acting opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV in the OR). We titrate further analgesics in the recovery room or intensive care unit (ICU). In our experience, more liberal opioid dosing based on anticipated pain or guided by hemodynamic endpoints (eg, to keep systolic BP below 160 mmHg) often results in somnolence, a delay in a satisfactory neurologic examination, and occasionally unnecessary head imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We reserve long-acting opioids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> (0.2 mg IV), for patients with no preoperative altered mental status and for those who have been taking preoperative or chronic opioids prior to the craniotomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemodynamic stability</strong> &ndash; Hypertension is common on emergence from anesthesia for craniotomy and should be treated quickly.

They can involve surgery on the brainstem, cerebellum, fourth ventricle, or surrounding bony structures. Anesthetic concerns for this particular type of craniotomy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positioning</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>For posterior fossa surgery, the patient may be positioned prone or in the sitting, lateral, park bench, or semisupine positions. These procedures may be many hours in duration and may be associated with significant blood loss and fluid administration, which can result in facial and airway edema. The prone position and those that include neck flexion or rotation can cause venous congestion and aggravate edema. (See <a href=\"#H336686064\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brainstem injury or edema</strong> &ndash; Surgery involving brainstem structures and postoperative brainstem edema can result in hemodynamic instability and cranial nerve dysfunction. Intraoperative hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, and arrhythmias are all possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurophysiologic monitoring</strong> &ndash; The choice of anesthetics may be affected by the use of neuromonitoring for cranial nerve function during these procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia#H3106240\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromonitoring in surgery and anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Anesthetic effects on neuromonitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emergence from anesthesia</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The decision to extubate the patient after posterior fossa craniotomy should be made in consultation with the surgeon, and should take into account the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of airway compromise related to preexisting cranial nerve pathology, the extent of surgical dissection and risk of cranial nerve palsy, and brainstem edema</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The duration of surgery, especially if performed in the prone position or with the neck flexed or rotated</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood loss and fluid administration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Visible facial swelling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cranial nerve palsy is uncommon after posterior fossa craniotomy but may be more likely with some specific procedures. A retrospective review including 500 patients who underwent posterior fossa craniotomy for a variety of indications reported a 4.8 percent incidence of postoperative cranial nerve palsy; two-thirds of these occurred in patients with cerebellopontine angle lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/148,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">148,149</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We make an individualized decision on extubation at the end of surgery. In addition to the usual criteria for extubation, in this setting we assess upper airway patency (eg, by performing an endotracheal tube leak test), review fluid balance, and note the presence or absence of cough and gag reflexes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults#H1136745195\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Extubation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8564396\"><span class=\"h2\">Awake craniotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Awake craniotomy is most commonly used for resection of brain tumors near eloquent regions of the cerebral cortex and for epilepsy surgery. Anesthesia for patients having awake craniotomy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-who-undergo-deep-brain-stimulator-implantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients who undergo deep brain stimulator implantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8564488\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF VENOUS AIR EMBOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If venous air embolism (VAE) is suspected or detected, the following steps should be taken immediately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107004 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Notify the surgeon</strong> &ndash; The site of air entry may be obvious to the surgeon and can be occluded, sealed with bone wax, or sutured closed. The surgical field should be flooded with saline to prevent air entry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower the head</strong> &ndash; The head of the operating table should be lowered to at or below the level of the heart, if possible, to eliminate the pressure gradient that is entraining air. Since air entry requires a venous opening, bleeding may result when the head is lowered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lowering the head may limit the surgeon's access to the operative site, especially during posterior fossa or cervical spine procedures, and may therefore prevent identification and treatment of the source of air entrainment. In these settings, we lower the head only in cases with severe VAE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discontinue </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a><strong> (N2O)</strong> &ndash; N2O should be discontinued to prevent an increase in the size of air bubbles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence#H283253190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;, section on 'Nitrous oxide gas'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aspirate air</strong> &ndash; Patients at high risk of VAE should have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed before the start of surgery. If VAE is suspected, the catheter should be aspirated for air. (See <a href=\"#H1139082704\" class=\"local\">'Central venous catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discontinue positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)</strong> &ndash; PEEP should be discontinued, if present. PEEP has been recommended in the past as a possibly preventative measure. However, its effectiveness in elevating cerebral venous pressure to levels above zero is limited, and it increases the likelihood of an intracardiac right-to-left shunt, converting a VAE into a much more dangerous paradoxical air embolism (PAE).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Jugular venous compression</strong> &ndash; Jugular venous compression may be performed to increase cerebral venous pressure, which may prevent further air entry into the circulation. This maneuver also often causes bleeding at the venous site that was entraining air, helping to identify the source of VAE. However, it may have undesired consequences such as cerebral venous engorgement, bradycardia with carotid sinus compression, and cerebral hypoperfusion with unintentional carotid artery compression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular support</strong> &ndash; Cardiovascular support may be needed if hypotension develops. The pathophysiology of cardiovascular collapse in this setting may include right ventricular outflow obstruction with air, and pulmonary hypertension. If paradoxical air embolism occurs, air may enter coronary arteries to cause myocardial ischemia. Treatment includes administration of intravenous (IV) fluid to increase preload, and vasopressors as necessary to increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac function.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8564494\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic management for craniotomy should be designed to maintain optimal cerebral physiology. General endotracheal anesthesia is the preferred technique, though for specific indications, the craniotomy can be performed awake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal anesthetic regimen (ie, total intravenous anesthesia [TIVA] versus inhalation anesthesia) for elective craniotomy is controversial. In many cases, we use a balanced anesthetic including relatively low doses of a potent inhalation anesthetic (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, and halothane), with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O), and opioids; a predominantly intravenous (IV) technique is preferred for patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). (See <a href=\"#H8564131\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of anesthesia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H356126656\" class=\"local\">'Our anesthesia strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetics have a variety of effects on cerebral physiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105673 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In general, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, IV induction agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, barbiturates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>) cause reductions in both cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), resulting in no change or a decrease in ICP, while responsiveness to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is maintained. (See <a href=\"#H78577820\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia induction agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The potent, halogenated inhalation anesthetics (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, halothane) are all dose-dependent cerebral vasodilators. While they reduce CMR, they can blunt cerebral autoregulation by uncoupling CBF and metabolism and increase CBF and ICP. Below 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), there is a modest decrease in CBF. Above 1 MAC, CBF increases. Responsiveness to CO<sub>2</sub> is maintained. (See <a href=\"#H258395315\" class=\"local\">'Potent inhalation agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>N<sub>2</sub>O can increase CBF, CMR, and ICP, with preserved CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness. The magnitude of changes in cerebral physiology with N<sub>2</sub>O is affected by the administration of other anesthetic drugs and by ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H258395389\" class=\"local\">'Nitrous oxide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IV agents may be used for maintenance of anesthesia along with inhalation agents, or as TIVA. Most commonly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> is administered as an infusion, along with opioids. Propofol infusion causes reduction in CMR, CBF, and ICP, while CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness is maintained. When administered with controlled ventilation, opioids have minimal effects on cerebral physiology. (See <a href=\"#H258395408\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anesthesiologist and surgeon should have a preoperative discussion regarding preexisting increased ICP, positioning for surgery, the risk of venous air embolism (VAE), goals for blood pressure (BP) and ventilation (goal partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> [PCO<sub>2</sub>]), and whether neurophysiologic monitoring will be used. (See <a href=\"#H336686134\" class=\"local\">'General concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positioning for craniotomy requires meticulous attention to detail to avoid nerve injury, skin pressure injuries, ocular injury, and airway compromise. Supine, prone, lateral, or sitting positions may be used. The sitting position is associated with a higher risk of VAE, hypotension, and pneumocephalus and is relatively contraindicated in those with a potential right-to-left intracardiac shunt. (See <a href=\"#H336686064\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP should be controlled during craniotomy to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). We aim for a CPP of 65 to 80 mmHg. Assuming a normal ICP of 5 to 10 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 75 to 90 mmHg is a reasonable target range for an uncomplicated patient. (See <a href=\"#H356126400\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV fluid should be administered at a rate and volume that achieves even fluid balance to achieve adequate cerebral perfusion and avoidance of cerebral edema. We administer 0.9% saline to match urine output. (See <a href=\"#H8564169\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercarbia should always be avoided during craniotomy. Hyperventilation reduces CBF and may be required to reduce ICP or to improve surgical exposure by relaxing the brain. Hyperventilation should not be used routinely, as the vasoconstriction that accompanies hyperventilation may result in brain ischemia. When indicated, hyperventilation should be guided by blood gases rather than by end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>), aiming for a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 30 to 35 mmHg. (See <a href=\"#H336791146\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain relaxation may be part of the surgical plan, or it may be required in response to unexpected brain swelling. (See <a href=\"#H8564183\" class=\"local\">'Brain relaxation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergence from anesthesia for craniotomy should be rapid and smooth to allow a postoperative neurologic examination. Opioids should be titrated as needed after emergence. Hypertension is common on emergence and should be treated rapidly. (See <a href=\"#H8564274\" class=\"local\">'Emergence from anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior fossa craniotomy may involve surgery on or around brainstem structures, which can result in perioperative hemodynamic instability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cranial nerve dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H1228133164\" class=\"local\">'Posterior fossa craniotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VAE can occur whenever the operative site is above the level of the heart. VAE is of particular risk in the sitting position and during surgery near venous sinuses. For patients at high risk of VAE, we place a central venous catheter (CVC) to allow for air aspiration and use monitors to detect VAE. VAE is potentially life-threatening and requires emergent management. (See <a href=\"#H8564488\" class=\"local\">'Management of venous air embolism'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-craniotomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Costello TG, Cormack JR.
