This topic will discuss the neuronal damage and neurodevelopmental changes that have been reported after exposure of the developing brain to anesthetics in animal and human studies, the proposed mechanisms for these effects, and the limitations of existing literature. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24380992\"><span class=\"h1\">THE ISSUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in animals have shown that anesthetic and sedative drugs can cause neuronal damage to the developing brain, and can cause lasting behavioral and cognitive deficits. Some human studies suggest an association between exposure of young children to anesthesia and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits, though causation has not been established, and the specific anesthetic and patient factors that may affect risk are unknown. While concerns have also been raised regarding anesthetic exposure of the developing brain in utero, there is currently little to no evidence in humans to support these concerns. </p><p>Any degree of neurotoxicity of anesthetic and sedative drugs in humans may have widespread implications. In the United States, there are over 1.3 million children under the age of five years who undergo surgical procedures each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Most of these children need and receive general anesthesia, and most of these procedures cannot be delayed without adding substantial risk. In addition, an increasing number of young children receive sedatives or general anesthesia for neuroimaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and many more require procedural sedation in the emergency department. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2117560874\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPOSED MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the research on the mechanisms of anesthetic neurotoxicity has focused on apoptosis, though it is now evident that other mechanisms may be involved.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxidative stress</strong> associated apoptosis <strong>&mdash; </strong>Anesthetic agents cause neuronal oxidative stress by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation within mitochondria during exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. ROS produced in this setting permit cytochrome c mobilization from the inner mitochondrial membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Simultaneously, the outer mitochondrial membrane becomes permeable following anesthetic-mediated gamma-aminobutyric acid<sub>A</sub> (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor stimulation and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The combination of these events allows cytochrome c to be released into the cytosol and sets in motion a cascade of cellular events that ultimately leads to apoptotic neuronal cell death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other mechanisms &mdash; </strong>Laboratory studies involving human embryonic stem cells and rodent neurons have suggested that anesthetics may impair neural development during critical periods through abnormalities of NMDA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> GABA receptor expression, activity, and signaling; neuroinflammation; and dysregulation of other growth and survival pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/4,7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-13</a>]. Furthermore, other downstream developmental processes, such as synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and dendritic branching, may be targeted and disrupted. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H786009218\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROTOXICOLOGIC EFFECTS IN ANIMAL STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal studies in multiple species from worms to nonhuman primates have reported neuronal apoptosis, and some studies have reported behavioral changes associated with exposure to anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

These studies are likely of greater translational value than rodent studies because the neurodevelopmental stage of NHPs is similar to humans at birth. In addition, in contrast with rodent studies, the conditions of human anesthesia can be mimicked in NHPs, and physiologic parameters can be measured and homeostasis maintained during anesthesia, as they would be in humans. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one study, infant rhesus monkeys that were exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> for four hours on days of life 6 to 10, followed by subsequent exposures on days of life 14 and 28, demonstrated increased anxiety compared with controls that underwent only a brief period of maternal separation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

While some studies have found varying risk of neurodevelopmental deficit based on the age at exposure to anesthesia, most have not accounted for the fact that children tend to receive different procedures at different ages.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, children exposed to anesthesia before age three had an increased risk of deficits in language and reasoning, but the same deficits were not present in children exposed between ages three and five, and 5 and 10, suggesting a potential vulnerability at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The opposite result, however, was found in one of the studies from Canada, finding that children exposed between ages two and four years were more likely to have deficits than children exposed from age zero to two years, suggesting vulnerability at an older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this study, however, the majority of children exposed at ages two to four years received anesthesia for dental procedures. It is possible that children who require anesthesia for dental procedures have a higher incidence of underlying behavioral problems compared to children who do not require anesthesia for these procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One other large retrospective study compared the risk of a mental health diagnosis or developmental delay for children in eleven separate age cohorts (from &lt;28 weeks to 5 years) undergoing minor common surgical procedures with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Although there was an increased risk for a mental health disorder or specifically developmental delay or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children with anesthesia exposure (hazard ratios 1.26 to 1.31), there was no difference in risk between the different age cohorts. There is little support for delaying necessary minor&nbsp;surgery in young children to reduce neurodevelopmental risks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81497331\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIALLY TOXIC EXPOSURE DOSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minimum potentially neurotoxic doses of sedatives and anesthetics in humans are unknown.

Most human studies lack information on the specific drugs and doses administered, or duration of anesthesia. Thus the number of exposures to anesthesia has been used as a surrogate for dose, with a single exposure considered to be a lower dose, and multiple exposures a higher dose. However, this approach may not account for the fact that some children undergo single complex procedures with long exposures, while others undergo multiple short straightforward procedures. Whether the number of exposures has an effect independent of the total duration of anesthesia is also unknown.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the studies in Minnesota that used learning disability as an outcome, deficits have only been found in multiple exposures but not single exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/37,40,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40,56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In studies of academic achievement, the association between exposure number and decreased neurodevelopmental function has been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3292456334\"><span class=\"h1\">THE FDA WARNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the published animal and clinical studies, as well as input from neurotoxicity investigators and stakeholders, in December 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings about potential risks of negative effects on the developing brain from administration of anesthetics and sedative drugs to pregnant women and children under age three, especially for repeated exposures or procedures lasting more than three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The FDA recommends that health care providers discuss with pregnant patients and parents of young children the benefits, risks, and appropriate timing of surgery requiring anesthesia that will take longer than three hours. However, the degree of risk remains unclear. The statements in the FDA warning that the children at risk are those who are under three years or in utero, and are exposed for more than three hours, are largely based on animal data and need to be further verified in clinical studies. Due to the lack of clinical evidence, in April 2017, the FDA modified their warning, stating that medically necessary procedures in pregnant women and children under age three should not be delayed and that practitioners should follow their usual practice paradigms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>In response to the FDA warning both the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] responded with statements of concern that necessary surgery and procedures requiring anesthesia might be delayed or avoided because of uncertain risks of deleterious effects of anesthesia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2367784794\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT WE TELL PARENTS AND PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When asked about the risks of anesthesia by parents, patients, and care providers, clinicians should highlight the differences between research findings in animals and humans and the uncertainty of any effect in children or fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>Some institutions and clinicians have elected to routinely include discussion of the potential risks of neurotoxicity of anesthetics as part of informed consent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] and there are resources available for those interested in doing so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] (also see the website for the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia at <a href=\"http://www.pedsanesthesia.org/&amp;token=wVh/iP//88os8W9gEo2+7j2spAK/tyQDC1CBmDK8mJAcBGEbuqCAP23Tum8d/HDj&amp;TOPIC_ID=94560\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.pedsanesthesia.org</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1353299783\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential risk of adverse neurodevelopmental effects of anesthetic agents in children remains uncertain.
