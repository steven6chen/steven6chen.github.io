The value of bronchoscopy has grown in its diagnostic and therapeutic capacity such that the clinician needs to be aware of the available technology and the associated clinical applications. </p><p>An overview of flexible bronchoscopy and accessory procedures that can be performed during flexible bronchoscopy are reviewed here. The procedure, indications, contraindications, and complications of flexible bronchoscopy are described separately.

It is typically performed using conscious sedation and is a smaller more flexible piece of equipment that permits access to the lower airways such as the third order of bronchi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076 \">figure 1</a>). Consequently, it is more widely used than rigid bronchoscopy for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. (See <a href=\"#H19909487\" class=\"local\">'Flexible bronchoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rigid bronchoscopy</strong> &ndash; Rigid bronchoscopy also uses a white light source to visualize the airways. However, compared to flexible bronchoscopy, it is a larger, more rigid piece of equipment that can only access the proximal airways. It requires general anesthesia and is usually used for interventional procedures for which flexible bronchoscopy cannot be performed. (See <a href=\"#H3912719092\" class=\"local\">'Rigid bronchoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Virtual bronchoscopy</strong> &ndash; Virtual bronchoscopy is a noninvasive form of bronchoscopy. It is not an endoscopic procedure but rather an imaging modality that reconstructs the airways in a three dimensional manner producing images that appear similar to those visualized during invasive bronchoscopy. Unlike flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, it cannot be used to acquire samples. Its use is limited to centers with expertise.

Unlike the rigid bronchoscope, the flexible bronchoscope has a mechanism to flex or extend its distal end (anteriorly or posteriorly), which facilitates insertion through curved airways and enhances its ability to reach distal airways. All other forms of bronchoscopy listed in the sections below are variants of this form of bronchoscopy.

The airways are imaged using imaging hardware, usually helical (spiral) computed tomography (CT) hardware, that allows the rapid acquisition of volumetric data of the entire airway&nbsp;in a relatively short time. These data are then analyzed by software to reconstruct three dimensional and endoluminal views of the airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Compared to rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, virtual bronchoscopy has the advantage of being noninvasive, being able to define the airways out to the seventh generation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076 \">figure 1</a>). As an example, it may be able to provide important information about the condition of the distal airway beyond an obstruction when a flexible bronchoscope cannot pass an obstructing airway lesion. It also provides important information about the location of structures outside of the airways (eg, lymph nodes or blood vessels). </p><p>The major limitation of virtual bronchoscopy is its inability to sample lesions such that it can only be used prior to rigid or flexible bronchoscopy in order to plan a procedure. </p><p>While most modalities use CT to provide virtual images of the airways, some reports describe virtual positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> bronchoscopy as a staging tool for lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Virtual Navigation Bronchoscopy (VNB) is used as a navigational tool to enhance the diagnostic utility of invasive modalities (eg, ultrathin bronchoscopy or endobronchial ultrasound) for the biopsy of peripheral parenchymal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].

The image of the airway is viewed by an operator peering directly into an eyepiece at the proximal end of the scope, located on the control handle. Image quality is related to the number and condition of the fragile fiberoptic bundle, which is prone to damage with use.

In suspected cases of mycobacterial infection or possible airborne transmission, fit tested N-95 masks should be worn by everyone present in the room during the procedure. It is a common practice to obtain three sets of negative sputum culture for AFB prior to doing a bronchoscopy in a suspected case of tuberculosis.

An appropriate protocol and experienced technicians play key roles in preventing a potential infectious outbreak (eg, mycobacterial, fungal, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, or other bacteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The four important steps in reprocessing a bronchoscope include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical cleaning of the lumen and the ports with an enzymatic solution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leak testing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soaking in disinfectant solution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinsing and drying </p><p/><p>Immediately after the completion of the procedure in the bronchoscopy suite, it is a good practice for the operator to suction saline through the bronchoscope to prevent sludge from forming in the working channel. Cleaning begins as soon as the bronchoscopy is completed. In the cleaning area, the bronchoscope should then be inspected for damage, since breaches on the surface of the bronchoscope may develop concretions of debris that cannot be disinfected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. All suction ports and attachments should be removed and attachments that cannot be properly cleaned (eg, suction port cap) should be either sterilized or disposed. The internal channels should be thoroughly brushed, since sludge and concretions can develop within the channels. A leak test is routinely performed to determine the integrity of the working channel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95523\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95523 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>The bronchoscope can be disinfected manually or with an automated endoscope reprocessor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95521\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95521 \">picture 6</a>). It is usually soaked for about 20 to 30 minutes in disinfectant solution. Common disinfectants include glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, ortho-phthalaldehyde, or a hydrogen peroxide formulation. Following disinfection, the bronchoscope is thoroughly rinsed with sterile water or filtered tap water and 70 percent alcohol, since any retained disinfectants may cause mucositis in subsequent patients. The inner channel can be dried by insufflating air into the working ports. After cleaning, the bronchoscopes are hung upright to prevent the accumulation of moisture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86429\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86429 \">picture 7</a>).

The bronchoscopist and the assistants should complete an operational training prior to using fluoroscopy per the institutional policy.

There are many types of bronchoscopy (flexible, rigid, or virtual) among which flexible bronchoscopy is the most common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51458 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22747832\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19909337\" class=\"local\">'Types of bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike the rigid bronchoscope, the flexible bronchoscope has a mechanism to flex or extend its distal end, which facilitates insertion through curved airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67231 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79391 \">figure 3</a>). The traditional white light flexible bronchoscope can examine the oropharynx, vocal cords, and trachea, and airways to the third order of bronchi can be visualized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076 \">figure 1</a>). Diagnostic samples may be obtained (from airways and lung parenchyma) and airway lesions can be treated with a variety of accessory equipment that can be used with the flexible bronchoscope. Other variants of the flexible bronchoscope exist, each with their own unique features for visualization and sampling of the tracheobronchial tree (eg, endobronchial ultrasound). (See <a href=\"#H19909487\" class=\"local\">'Flexible bronchoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be selected for flexible bronchoscopy only after carefully weighing the indications and contraindications.
