The disease is named for Prosper Meni&egrave;re, a French physician who first reported that the inner ear could be the source of a syndrome manifesting episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The classic pathologic lesion of Meniere disease is termed endolymphatic hydrops. This lesion can be definitively diagnosed only by postmortem histopathologic analysis of the temporal bone. However, hydrops has also been identified in postmortem examination of temporal bones where there was no history of Meniere symptoms.</p><p>Meniere disease refers to presentation of the typical set of symptoms with an idiopathic etiology. The symptomatic triad may also occur secondary to other inner ear disorders, in which case it is termed Meniere syndrome. The symptom triad may be a final common pathway of many different inner ear insults.</p><p>This topic will present an overview of the diagnosis and treatment of Meniere disease. More detailed topics addressing the differential diagnosis of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden sensorineural hearing loss&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-tinnitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of tinnitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meniere disease can begin at any age, but patients typically present with symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40. Meniere syndrome in children is most often associated with congenital malformations of the inner ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The precise incidence of Meniere disease is difficult to determine because of nonstandard criteria for diagnosis, but the reported incidence ranges from 10 to 150 per 100,000 persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Bilateral disease occurs in 10 to 50 percent of patients, with most reports quoting a 25 to 35 percent risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meniere disease is associated with endolymphatic hydrops with distortion and distention of the membranous, endolymph-containing portions of the labyrinthine system. Although most patients have no identifiable other underlying otologic disease, multiple potential causes of endolymphatic hydrops have been proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50362 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>It is unclear why excess fluid builds up in the endolymphatic spaces of the inner ear. Several theories have been proposed, but all remain unproven. Lack of a single etiologic theory for Meniere disease may reflect underlying clinical and genetic heterogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Proposed etiologies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blockage at the endolymphatic sac or duct &ndash; One popular theory postulates an abnormality in the resorption of endolymph at the endolymphatic sac. Endolymphatic hydrops has been experimentally induced in guinea pigs by blocking the entrance to the endolymphatic sac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another proposed hypothesis is that the hydrops could start as a result of detached saccular otoconia (calcium deposits), which could block the flow of endolymph. This mechanism has also been postulated as the cause of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Patients with a family history had an earlier age of onset and the manifestations were more severe in successive generations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A specific gene marker has not been identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A viral etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] &ndash; Although a viral etiology has been proposed, DNA for suspected viruses (herpes simplex, varicella zoster, and cytomegalovirus) has not been detected in endolymphatic samples taken at surgery for patients with Meniere disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A vascular etiology &ndash; Migraine occurs more commonly in patients with Meniere disease than in the general population, leading to the postulation of a common vascular pathophysiology for the two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p>The mechanism responsible for symptoms of Meniere disease is also unknown. While endolymphatic hydrops is present in all patients with Meniere disease, not all patients with endolymphatic hydrops have symptoms.</p><p>The &quot;rupture theory,&quot; elaborated 40 to 50 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], proposes that rupture of the dilated endolymphatic sac allows potassium-rich endolymph into the perilymphatic space. The resulting biochemical gradient depolarizes the cochlear and vestibular hair cells, resulting in acute loss of function. Once pressure between the endolymphatic and perilymphatic space is equalized, the membrane rupture can seal over. Ion &quot;pumps&quot; restore the normal gradient and hair cell function. Repeated ionic insults eventually lead to degeneration of the hair cells. Cytologic changes in hair cells with potassium ion intoxication have been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the rupture theory has been called into question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of Meniere disease include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodic vertigo (a true spinning sensation that has an onset and an offset)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensorineural hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tinnitus</p><p/><p>Meniere disease is diagnosed only if patients complain of both episodic vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss. Aural fullness and nausea may be seen in conjunction with these symptoms. Affected patients tend to cycle from active symptoms to prolonged remissions. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Vertigo is characteristically rotatory spinning or a rocking sensation, may be associated with nausea and vomiting, and persists from 20 minutes to 24 hours duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Additional sensations of disequilibrium or other patterns of dizziness are seen in about 15 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hearing loss is sensorineural, usually fluctuating, and often initially affects the lower frequencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Hearing loss progresses over time and often results in permanent hearing loss at all frequencies in the affected ear over an 8- to 10-year period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Downward fluctuations in hearing are typically associated with intense aural fullness or pressure in the ear or the side of the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Tinnitus is characteristically low pitch (like listening to a seashell or machinery) and may be associated with auditory distortion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-tinnitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of tinnitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The course of Meniere disease varies among individuals. Some patients have marked hearing fluctuation and progressive hearing loss with infrequent vestibular symptoms; some have severe and frequent vertigo with only mild auditory symptoms; and some manifest both auditory and vestibular symptoms in equal measure. Approximately two-thirds of patients experience vertigo attacks in clusters, while one-third have sporadic attacks. The frequency of vertigo episodes may decline over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presumed diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops is based upon clinical symptoms. There is no specific diagnostic test for Meniere disease and a definitive diagnosis can only be made postmortem.</p><p>The clinical diagnosis in most patients is based upon the history, neurotologic evaluation, and clinical response to medical management. Patients usually have some variable auditory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vestibular symptoms for three to five years before they meet the diagnostic criteria for Meniere disease.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria proposed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) stipulate that a &quot;definite&quot; diagnosis of Meniere disease requires the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two spontaneous episodes of rotational vertigo lasting at least 20 minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Audiometric confirmation of sensorineural hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tinnitus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a perception of aural fullness</p><p/><p>Further investigation is also required to rule out other disorders in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Audiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Audiometry should be performed in all patients with suspected Meniere disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The most common audiometric pattern in early Meniere disease is a low frequency or combined low- and high-frequency sensory loss with normal hearing in the mid frequencies. Over time, the hearing loss &quot;flattens out.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Vestibular testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vestibular testing may be normal early in the course but will eventually be abnormal on the affected side. Testing is primarily useful in determining candidacy for interventional treatments or identifying possible bilateral disease.</p><p>A standard vestibular evaluation includes electronystagmography (ENG), rotary chair testing, and computerized dynamic posturography. With progression of Meniere disease, both the ENG and rotary chair test should show evidence of declining peripheral vestibular function in the affected ear. The ENG (particularly the caloric test, in which the ear canals are irrigated with warm and cool water to stimulate the inner ear) is more sensitive for inner balance dysfunction, but the rotary chair test is more specific.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood testing includes a search for suspected comorbid conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66900\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66900 \">table 2</a>) and a serologic test (eg, rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) for syphilis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tests for antibodies against inner ear antigens have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>] but are not considered to be clinically useful and are not part of a routine evaluation for Meniere disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify features that support a diagnosis of Meniere disease, but the findings are not diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Nevertheless, MRI is usually indicated to rule out central nervous system (CNS) lesions that can mimic Meniere disease, including CNS tumors, aneurysms, or stenosis of the posterior circulation, Arnold-Chiari malformations, and findings suggesting multiple sclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for endolymphatic hydrops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific tests for endolymphatic hydrops include glycerine, urea, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> &quot;stress&quot; tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and electrocochleography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These tests have low sensitivity and specificity and their role in the diagnosis and management of Meniere disease is controversial.</p><p>The vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) is a newer test that shows promise for diagnosis and monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Cervical VEMP (cVEMP) is an inhibitory sacculocollic reflex test that shows characteristic changes in symptomatic ears of Meniere patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and may detect early saccular hydrops before the onset of classic Meniere symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Ocular VEMP (oVEMP) engages both utricular and saccular afferent nerve fibers and may also be useful in assessment of Meniere patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition to diagnosis, VEMP may be useful for monitoring patients for disease progression and to identify the active ear in patients with bilateral disease. VEMP is an emerging technology that has not yet been standardized or fully validated clinically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditions that need to be considered when Meniere disease is suspected include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63235\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63235 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vestibular schwannoma &ndash; Patients with vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) typically present with progressive asymmetric hearing loss but can sometimes have fluctuating hearing loss. Such patients rarely have true vertigo but may complain of imbalance. Occasional patients will have tinnitus and imbalance with normal hearing. Auditory brainstem response (auditory evoked response) testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with vestibular schwannoma show abnormalities indicating compression of the eighth nerve complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple sclerosis &ndash; Multiple sclerosis can present with symptoms identical to those of Meniere disease. However, the observed nystagmus during an attack of multiple sclerosis is typically more severe and longer lasting, and the patients may have other neurologic complaints. Central abnormalities are seen on electronystagmogram testing (which is typically normal in early Meniere disease). White matter lesions may be seen on MRI and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities may be detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient ischemic attack &ndash; Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are typically of shorter duration than Meniere attacks. In addition, patients with TIAs rarely experience simultaneous vestibular and cochlear symptoms, and TIAs do not cause persistent tinnitus or objective hearing loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine &ndash; Migraine-associated vertigo is an important consideration, especially those with a history of migraine headache and in young patients with new onset of episodic vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The prevalence of migrainous vertigo is approximately 3 to 5 percent in the general population, far higher than the 0.2 percent prevalence of Meniere disease in the United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Migraine must always be considered as an alternative or confounding illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Headache is usually present with migrainous vertigo, either during the episode or afterwards (when vertigo or tinnitus is a migraine aura). Migrainous vertigo is often accompanied by photophobia or phonophobia, symptoms not seen in vertigo episodes associated with Meniere disease. Diagnostic criteria include episodic vestibular symptoms and at least two migraine symptoms (migrainous headache, photophobia, phonophobia, or visual or other aura) occurring during at least two vertiginous episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular migraine&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Successful treatment with triptans during an attack is generally diagnostic, although migrainous vertigo is less responsive than headaches. A decrease in the frequency of events with migraine prophylaxis supports the diagnosis of migrainous vertigo. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; Diabetes and thyroid disease can sometimes cause symptoms that have some overlap with Meniere disease. Hearing complaints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tinnitus are usually bilateral in these conditions and the patients often have chronic imbalance instead of attacks of true vertigo. Similar symptoms may occur in patients with severe anemia. Appropriate testing can diagnose these conditions.</p><p/><p>Cogan's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory condition that occurs most commonly in young adults and can include vestibuloauditory symptoms that are similar to Meniere disease. The diagnosis is typically raised by the constellation of symptoms associated with Cogan's syndrome, including eye disease and systemic vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cogans-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cogan's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meniere disease should be considered a chronic condition; treatment may successfully relieve symptoms but does not address the underlying abnormal pathophysiology.</p><p>The goals of treatment are to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the frequency and severity of vertigo attacks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce or eliminate hearing loss and tinnitus associated with attacks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alleviate chronic symptoms (tinnitus and balance issues)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize disability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent disease progression, particularly hearing loss and imbalance</p><p/><p>Patient education is an important part of conservative management and includes outlining an explanation of the disease, expectations for response, and treatment options. Up to 90 percent of patients with Meniere disease are able to maintain normal daily activities with medical management.</p><p>Determining the optimal treatment for Meniere disease is limited by the lack of randomized, controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/8,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,42</a>]. In addition, drug therapy has been associated with a significant placebo effect, and the relapsing remitting nature of the disorder has made evaluation of various treatments difficult.</p><p>Vertigo attacks can be controlled in 90 to 95 percent of patients by conservative medical treatment, although progressive hearing loss rarely responds to treatment. Patients with suspected Meniere disease should be referred at a relatively early stage to an <span class=\"nowrap\">otologist/otolaryngologist</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINTERVENTIONAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninterventional treatment for Meniere disease includes lifestyle adjustments, medical therapies, and rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle adjustments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Meniere disease are more vulnerable to dietary and environmental factors that can impact hearing and balance. Triggers for Meniere disease may include high salt intake, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, stress, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and allergies. Avoidance for patients with identified triggers may alleviate or ameliorate symptoms.</p><p>Salt restriction is commonly recommended as part of initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], although data supporting its efficacy are not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniere-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An appropriate salt-restricted diet will have approximately 2 to 3 g of sodium per day. The daily sodium intake should be evenly spread across meals to avoid a large bolus at any time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Caffeine and nicotine are vasoconstrictors that may reduce microvascular flow in the labyrinthine system. Alcohol also causes fluid and electrolyte shifts that can stress a fragile ear. Limiting caffeine to one caffeinated beverage (coffee, tea, or cola) daily and limiting alcohol to one drink daily is typically recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute episodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute episodes of vertigo should be managed with vestibular suppressants and antiemetics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68052 \">table 4</a>).
