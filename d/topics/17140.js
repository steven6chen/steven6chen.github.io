Their importance in coronary disease and in acute coronary syndromes is indirectly confirmed by the benefit of antiplatelet agents (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, and the glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors) in these disorders.

Disruption of the endothelium also exposes collagen. These factors lead to the adherence of platelets to the subendothelium, both directly and via von Willebrand factor, and, subsequently, to platelet activation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63712 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The following is a brief summary of platelet adhesion and aggregation. These processes are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-biology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet biology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Adhesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelet adhesion is mediated by the binding of platelet receptors to a number of arterial wall receptors, including subendothelial collagen (whose corresponding platelet receptor is glycoprotein [GP] <span class=\"nowrap\">Ia/IIa),</span> von Willebrand factor (GP <span class=\"nowrap\">Ib/IX</span> and GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/III),</span> and fibrinogen (GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Binding of platelets to these structural proteins in concert with the action of soluble receptor-mediated stimulants, such as thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and thromboxane A2 (TxA2), induces platelet activation. This process involves the mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores, the activation of several intracellular kinases, and the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, resulting in the generation of TxA2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70151\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70151 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Platelet activation produced in vivo is enhanced by circulating catecholamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Aggregation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelet aggregation results from conversion of the <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptor to a form that can bind adhesive proteins, such as fibrinogen. This process is normally opposed by the secretion of nitric oxide and of prostacyclin (PGI2), another product of arachidonic acid metabolism, from the vascular endothelium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During and after aggregation, platelets release many substances that can induce further platelet accumulation and activation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and mitogenesis, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet factor 4, and &szlig;-thromboglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Platelet-released serotonin normally causes vasodilation; however, it can induce vasoconstriction in the presence of damaged or abnormal (dysfunctional) endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Activated platelets also release nitric oxide&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This response may prevent an excessive response by inhibiting platelet recruitment to the growing thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF THE ACUTE ISCHEMIC SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiographic severity of coronary stenosis does not adequately predict the location of subsequent coronary artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, rupture of atheromatous plaque and subsequent occlusive thrombus formation are believed to be responsible for most acute myocardial ischemic events, such as unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. However, systemic effects, such as inflammation, are more widespread within the coronary circulation and lead to instability of multiple plaques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Interaction of thrombosis and inflammation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary artery thrombosis is the final pathogenic mechanism of acute ischemic events, including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac arrest. There are complex interactions among the atherosclerotic artery, endothelial injury and dysfunction, vasospasm, and platelet activation. Plaque rupture exposes thrombogenic subendothelial components, leading to platelet deposition and activation.</p><p>The following observations are compatible with the importance of platelet thrombus formation in acute ischemic syndromes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombus formation within a coronary vessel is the acute precipitating event in most unstable ischemic coronary syndromes, as documented by angiographic and pathologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Among patients with sudden death due to coronary thrombosis, the thrombi typically have a layered appearance indicative of episodic growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Episodic growth may alternate with intermittent fragmentation of the thrombus, leading to distal embolization of both thrombus and platelet aggregates and microinfarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Platelets provide a membrane surface for the assembly of procoagulants, two of which (factors V and VIII) are released with activation.

One prospective study, for example, found a phasic increase in the excretion of thromboxane A2 metabolites in 84 percent of episodes of unstable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with unstable angina have elevated levels of P-selectin, an integral membrane protein involved in platelet adhesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pulsatile shear stress, as occurs in stenotic arteries, can cause platelet aggregation via an increased expression of P-selectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Hydrodynamic shear stress, resulting from plaque rupture, can activate platelets and cause both platelet aggregation (via glycoprotein [GP] <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> and von Willebrand factor) and platelet-mediated neutrophil aggregation via upregulation of P-selectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

This finding is consistent with serial angioscopic studies showing persistence of complex yellow plaque and thrombus after successful reperfusion at one month and later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

However, no benefit for platelet function testing with corresponding medication adjustment was found in the setting of coronary disease when the testing was conducted before and soon after stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>These findings are consistent with another platelet-related factor that has been associated with cardiovascular thrombosis, which is the presence of larger, more reactive platelets in patients with acute ischemic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The increase in platelet size, which is in compensation for a persistent decrease in platelet count, results from the ongoing consumption of platelets in unstable angina; this is not seen in an acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, platelets from patients with unstable angina, as determined by studying platelet aggregability ex vivo, are hyperaggregable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These effects promote thrombus growth, limitation of blood flow, and acute ischemia.</p><p>Platelet reactivity is altered by a number of environmental factors, such as age, serum cholesterol, diabetes, catecholamine levels, cigarette smoking, obesity, and alcohol consumption. However, data from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that these factors play only a minor role, accounting for only 4 to 7 percent of variance; in contrast, estimates suggest that heritable factors play a major role, accounting for 20 to 30 percent of the overall variance in platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymorphisms of platelet glycoprotein receptor genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The functions of the platelet GP receptors have been described above. It has been suggested that polymorphisms in these receptors are a risk factor for coronary artery thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], although data from Framingham suggest that these polymorphisms contribute minimally to platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Patients with acute coronary syndromes have increased interactions between platelets (homotypic aggregates) and between platelets and <span class=\"nowrap\">leukocytes/neutrophils</span> (heterotypic aggregates). These latter aggregates form when platelets are activated and adhere to circulating leukocytes or neutrophils.</p><p>Accumulating information suggests that inflammation plays an important role during the thrombotic phase of acute coronary syndromes. Leukocytes and neutrophils bind to platelets via P-selectin and beta-2-integrin, a process that requires platelet production of platelet-activating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].

These interactions suggest a mechanism for the coupling of thrombosis and inflammation during cardiac ischemia and are consistent with the increase in unstable coronary syndromes seen post-infection that is widely thought to be platelet mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-platelets-in-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].
