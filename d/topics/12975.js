The opening is between the upper 2 chambers of the heart, which are called the right atrium and left atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87129 \">figure 1</a>). A patent foramen ovale lets blood flow between these chambers.</p><p>Before birth when a baby is growing in its mother's uterus (womb), an opening between the right atrium and left atrium is normal. It lets blood flow through the heart in the correct way. (The way blood flows through the heart before birth is different from the way it flows through the heart after birth.)</p><p>After birth, an opening between the right atrium and left atrium is not needed anymore. In most babies, the opening closes on its own soon after birth. But in some babies, it does not close.</p><p>When the opening between the right atrium and left atrium doesn't close after birth, doctors call it a patent foramen ovale, or &quot;PFO&quot; for short. A PFO is very common. About 1 out of every 4 people has a PFO. Doctors don't know what causes a PFO.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595571071\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a PFO?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people have no symptoms or problems from their PFO. Some people might find out they have it when their doctor does a test for another reason.</p><p>In some cases, a PFO can lead to problems. Although uncommon, some PFOs can lead to a stroke. A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. It can cause problems with speaking, thinking, or moving the arms or legs.</p><p>A PFO can lead to a stroke in the following way: A blood clot can form in a leg vein. The blood clot can travel through the blood to the heart. It then enters the right atrium. If a person has a PFO, the blood clot can then flow into the left atrium. From there, it flows into the left ventricle and then to the body or brain. A blood clot that travels to the brain can cause a stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595571086\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a PFO?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The test done most often to check for a PFO is an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 2</a>). This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart as it beats.</p><p>Your doctor will likely do a test called a &quot;bubble test&quot; with your echo. He or she will put some salt water (that has bubbles) into your vein through a thin tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; Then your doctor will do an echo to watch how the bubbles flow through your heart.</p><p>People might have tests to check for a PFO if they have a stroke and their doctor can't find a cause of the stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595571118\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a PFO treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on whether your PFO causes symptoms or not.</p><p>If your PFO causes no symptoms, it does not need treatment.</p><p>If you had a stroke that could have been caused by your PFO, your doctor will talk with you about possible treatments. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines to prevent blood clots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure or surgery to close your PFO</p><p/><p>Your doctor might also recommend things you can do on your own to prevent blood clots in your legs. To help prevent blood clots in your legs, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sitting or standing still in the same position for a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stand up and walk around every 1 to 2 hours, including when you take long trips by car, train, or plane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your position when you are sitting, and move your legs and feet often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoke</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595571193\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-septal-defect-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial septal defect (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
