Morphea is distinct from systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), an autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by acral or diffuse cutaneous sclerosis and frequent systemic manifestations. Use of the term morphea diminishes the likelihood of confusion between these two disorders, which can lead to unnecessary patient anxiety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with morphea present with single or multiple inflammatory or sclerotic plaques. Disease activity typically persists for three to six years; some patients develop more persistent or recurring involvement. Cosmetic disfigurement or functional impairments due to atrophy or contractures often remain after the resolution of active disease.

The annual incidence of morphea was approximately 3 per 100,000 people in a population in the United States between 1960 and 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Although morphea can occur at any age, many patients (50 to 65 percent) develop the disease as adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In a nested case-control study of 110 patients with adult-onset morphea and 77 patients with juvenile-onset disease conducted at an academic medical center, the mean ages of disease onset were 45 years and 10 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Females are more susceptible to morphea than males; in a retrospective study of 82 patients with morphea, the female to male ratio was 2.6 to 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Ethnicity also may influence the risk for morphea.

A variety of factors, including autoimmunity, genetics, and vascular dysfunction may play a role in morphea. Multiple environmental factors (eg, radiation, infections, skin trauma [eg, friction, surgery], or environmental exposures) also have been proposed as contributors to disease expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Atrophy in lesions that primarily involve the dermis may present as areas of fine, cigarette-paper like skin or shallow (cliff drop-like) depressions.

Therefore, patients with findings consistent with morphea should be asked about a history of Raynaud phenomenon (a common early feature of systemic sclerosis) and should be evaluated clinically for other signs and symptoms of systemic sclerosis, such as nail fold capillary changes, sclerodactyly, or acrosclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H8784262\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults#H174896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for suspected systemic sclerosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8784295\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue biopsies are generally reserved for cases in which the diagnosis is in question. All biopsy specimens should include subcutaneous fat. A punch biopsy that extends into the subcutaneous fat can be performed in superficial lesions of morphea. In cases of deep involvement, a punch biopsy is unlikely to reach sufficient depth, and an incisional biopsy should be performed. </p><p>The biopsy specimen can be taken from the inflammatory or indurated border if present, or from a central sclerotic area. The pathologist should be informed of the clinical features of the site from which the biopsy is taken. For lesions with minimal clinical change, a second biopsy from unaffected skin in a location similar to the lesion site (eg, contralateral skin) should be performed to assist with interpretation of the lesional pathologic findings.</p><p>The pathology of morphea varies based upon biopsy site, lesion stage, and lesion depth. Biopsies performed from inflammatory lesions demonstrate an interstitial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrate composed primarily of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Eosinophils, mast cells, and macrophages may be present. Inflammation may extend into the subcutaneous tissues. In addition, tissue edema, enlarged tortuous vessels, and thickened collagen bundles may be observed.</p><p>As sclerosis progresses, lesions demonstrate homogenization of the papillary dermis and thickened collagen bundles extending into the reticular dermis or beyond (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76952\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76952 \">picture 10</a>). Fat surrounding eccrine glands diminishes, and advanced sclerotic lesions exhibit compression and loss of appendageal structures. Few blood vessels are present, and those that remain exhibit fibrotic walls and narrowed lumina. In specimens from deep morphea, the deep reticular dermis, subcutis, and fascia show sclerotic changes. </p><p>The atrophic phase of morphea is characterized by loss of inflammatory cell infiltrate, less sclerosis, and an absence of appendageal structures. Telangiectasia may be evident.</p><p>The histopathologic findings may correlate with patient symptoms. A study of 83 adults and children with morphea found an association between a bottom-heavy pattern of sclerosis and symptoms of pain and tightness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Lesions of morphea typically begin as inflammatory patches or plaques that evolve into firm, sclerotic plaques. Involvement may be limited to the dermis, or may extend to underlying subcutaneous fat, muscle, or bone. Atrophic changes often remain after lesion resolution. (See <a href=\"#H16539063\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The identification of characteristic clinical findings often is sufficient for the diagnosis of morphea. Biopsy can be useful when the diagnosis is in question or to obtain information on the depth of disease. Biopsies should always extend at least into the subcutaneous fat. For sclerotic lesions, particularly those with modest clinical change, a second biopsy from unaffected skin in a similar location will assist with interpretation of the pathologic findings.
