EEG alterations occurring in the context of PLMS may include K complexes, K-alpha complexes, brief bursts of alpha activity or other <span class=\"nowrap\">cortical/subcortical</span> arousals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-abnormal-movements-during-sleep/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>PLMS can appear immediately with the onset of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 1 (N1) sleep, but they are more frequent during NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep and decrease in frequency during NREM stage 3 (N3) sleep.

Many centers further break down leg movement count by stage of sleep (NREM and REM sleep) and total sleep time. Of note, there are few data to suggest that PLMS associated with an arousal are of any greater clinical significance than PLMS without arousal.</p><p>Not all leg movements during PSG constitute PLMS. Some leg kicks are either too long (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104841\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104841 \">waveform 5</a>) or too short (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104843\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104843 \">waveform 6</a>) to qualify as PLMS. Depending on the clinical context, shorter leg movements may represent excessive fragmentary myoclonus or foot tremor, and longer movements may be leg cramps. (See <a href=\"#H428531848\" class=\"local\">'Excessive fragmentary myoclonus'</a> below and <a href=\"#H428531788\" class=\"local\">'Sleep-related leg cramps'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical significance of PLMS is controversial. PLMS can be nonspecific and may be observed in healthy individuals. PLMS in isolation (ie, not associated with another sleep or medical disorder) are benign, sporadic episodes of involuntary leg movements that occur during sleep. PLMS can also be seen in the context of sleep disorders such as untreated sleep apnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104844\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104844 \">waveform 7</a>) or narcolepsy, and can represent a potential marker for other primary sleep disorders like restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease <span class=\"nowrap\">(RLS/WED)</span> or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span> have also been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in several population-based studies.

These movements are specifically distinguished from tremors, which are defined as a rhythmic and involuntary movement of any body part.</p><p>The motor manifestations primarily involve either body rocking, head banging, or head rolling from side to side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104849%7ESLEEP%2F104850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104849 graphicRef104850 \">figure 2A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104852\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104852 \">waveform 11</a>).

Unlike PLMS, which are usually separated by 20- to 40-second intervals, individual muscle activations in ALMA approximate the frequency of muscle activation seen in human locomotion.</p><p>ALMA are defined by muscle activations that each have a duration of 100 to 500 milliseconds (much shorter than PLMS), with a frequency range for the alternating EMG bursts of 0.5 to 3.0 Hz.

The jerks may be spontaneous or induced by stimuli.</p><p>PSG recordings may reveal a hypnic jerk during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, and mainly at the beginning of the sleep episode. Multiple jerks occasionally occur in succession, usually early in the sleep period. Superficial EMG recordings of the involved muscles show brief high-amplitude potentials, generally 75 to 250 milliseconds in duration. The EEG typically shows drowsiness or stage N1 sleep patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104858\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104858 \">waveform 16</a>).</p><p>The motor activity is often associated with a sensory, auditory, or visual component. The individual may not recall the jerk if it does not result in an awakening. Hypnic jerks are common and often related to sleep deprivation. When frequent, intense, or repetitive, they may result in insomnia.
