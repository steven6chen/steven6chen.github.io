Chondrosarcomas are the third most common primary malignancy of bone after myeloma and osteosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They account for 20 to 27 percent of primary malignant osseous neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Clinical behavior is variable. Ninety percent are conventional chondrosarcomas, 90 percent of which are low- to intermediate-grade tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These tumors are slow growing with a low metastatic potential. They are considered relatively refractory to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</p><p>In contrast, high-grade chondrosarcomas, which include 5 to 10 percent of conventional chondrosarcomas as well as some rare variants, have a high metastatic potential and a poor prognosis following resection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some of the rare subtypes are more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the classification, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic options for chondrosarcoma. The rare chondrosarcomas involving the head and neck and skull base, as well as diagnosis and biopsy techniques for bone sarcomas in general, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chordoma-and-chondrosarcoma-of-the-skull-base\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-tumors-diagnosis-and-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone tumors: Diagnosis and biopsy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGIC GRADING AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic grade is one of the most important indicators of clinical behavior and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Chondrosarcomas are graded on a scale from 1 to 3, based upon nuclear size, staining pattern (hyperchromasia), mitotic activity, and degree of cellularity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74562\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74562 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 chondrosarcomas were reclassified in the updated World Health Organization (WHO) 2013 classification system as &quot;atypical cartilaginous tumor&quot; <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACT/CS1)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They are moderately cellular, with an abundant hyaline cartilage matrix. The chondrocytes have small, round nuclei and are occasionally binucleate. Mitoses are absent. <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> almost never metastasize (1 percent risk in one series of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]) and are therefore now considered a locally aggressive neoplasm rather than a malignant sarcoma. Ten-year survival is 83 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 chondrosarcomas are more cellular with less chondroid matrix than <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> tumors. Mitoses are present, but widely scattered. The chondrocyte nuclei are enlarged and can be either vesicular or hyperchromatic. The metastatic potential is intermediate between low-grade and high-grade chondrosarcomas (approximately 10 to 15 percent). Ten-year survival is approximately 64 to 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9</a>].</p><p/><p>The vast majority of conventional (primary and secondary) chondrosarcomas are <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> or chondrosarcoma grade 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 chondrosarcomas are highly cellular, with nuclear pleomorphism and easily detected mitoses. Chondroid matrix is sparse or absent. High-grade chondrosarcomas have a high metastatic potential (approximately 32 to 70 percent) and a poor prognosis with surgical resection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The 10-year survival rate is approximately 29 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>].</p><p/><p>In most cases, the histologic grade of differentiation of a recurrent chondrosarcoma is the same as the primary lesion; however, up to 13 percent of recurrences exhibit a higher grade of malignancy when compared with the original neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/5,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,11</a>]. This suggests that chondrosarcomas can progress biologically.</p><p>Histologic grading is subject to interobserver variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], which can be problematic since surgical therapy for <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> and grade 2 chondrosarcomas is often different. Because of this, there is an urgent need for molecular markers that can be used to predict clinical behavior, guide therapeutic decision making, and provide novel targets for molecularly targeted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The majority are located in the long bones, predominantly around the knee.</p><p>The inherited condition multiple osteochondromas (hereditary multiple exostoses) is characterized by the development of two or more osteochondromas in the appendicular and axial skeleton. This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The prevalence in the general population is 1:50,000, and males are affected slightly more often than females. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Osteochondroma and hereditary multiple osteochondromas'</a>.) </p><p>Almost 90 percent of cases of multiple osteochondromas are caused by inheritance of a germline mutation in one of the tumor suppressor genes <em>EXT1</em> or <em>EXT2</em>. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although most are asymptomatic, osteochondromas can cause pain, functional problems, and deformity; they also carry a risk for fracture. Malignant transformation is estimated to occur in 5 percent of patients with a solitary or multiple osteochondromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. In one series, the average time between initial diagnosis and malignant transformation was 9.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All chondrosarcomas arising in the setting of an osteochondroma are secondary peripheral tumors.</p><p>A change in the size of an osteochondroma or new onset of symptoms warrants investigation, as each may herald malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Osteochondromas located at the pelvis, hips and shoulder girdle are reported to be particularly prone to malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Among patients with multiple osteochondromas, malignant transformation appears to be unrelated to the presence or absence of an <em>EXT</em> mutation, sex, severity of disease, or the number of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Enchondroma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enchondromas are common benign cartilaginous tumors that develop in the medulla (marrow cavity) of bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82362\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82362 \">image 2</a>). When multiple enchondromas are present, the condition is called enchondromatosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64618\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64618 \">image 3</a>), of which the most common form is Ollier disease (estimated prevalence 1 in 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When multiple enchondromas are associated with soft tissue hemangiomas, the designation is Maffucci syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70081\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70081 \">image 4</a>). Both are congenital but not inherited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Enchondroma'</a>.)</p><p>Ollier disease as well as Maffucci syndrome are caused by somatic mosaic mutations in the <em>IDH1</em> or <em>IDH2</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the vast majority are asymptomatic, clinical problems caused by enchondromas include skeletal deformity, limb-length discrepancy, and a risk for malignant transformation. Malignant transformation in a solitary enchondroma is presumed to be extremely rare (&lt;1 percent) but it has been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55316\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55316 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The risk is highest with enchondromas located in the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Malignant transformation usually presents after skeletal maturity and may be heralded by the development of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The histologic and radiographic distinction between an enchondroma and a low-grade chondrosarcoma may be difficult, even in experienced hands (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Histologic appearance'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Conventional chondrosarcomas</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Central chondrosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central chondrosarcomas of bone arise within the medullary cavity and constitute approximately 75 percent of all chondrosarcomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50684 \">table 1</a>). The majority are thought to arise primarily (ie, without a benign precursor lesion). However, the finding of remnants of a preexisting enchondroma in 40 percent of central chondrosarcomas and the fact that most enchondromas remain asymptomatic and clinically silent have led some to hypothesize that most central chondrosarcomas could be secondary to a preexisting enchondroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients are over the age of 50. There is a slight male predominance.</p><p>The most commonly involved skeletal sites are the proximal femur, bones of the pelvis (particularly the ilium), and proximal humerus (together accounting for about 75 percent of cases), followed by distal femur, ribs, tibia, and metacarpal and metatarsal bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/3,4,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,32,33</a>]. Other less frequently involved sites include the spine, the skull base, and the craniofacial bones.

Pain is typically insidious, progressive, worse at night, and often present for months to years before presentation. A pathologic fracture is present at diagnosis in 3 to 17 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Primary spinal chondrosarcomas are rare but can cause compression of the spinal cord.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral chondrosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, all peripheral chondrosarcomas arise within the cartilage cap of a preexisting osteochondroma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50684 \">table 1</a>). Patients with a peripheral chondrosarcoma are generally younger than those with a central chondrosarcoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50684 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The clinical presentation is similar to that of central chondrosarcoma, usually pain and local swelling. The most commonly involved bones are the pelvis and bones of the shoulder girdle, although in some series, the long bones predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The distinction between osteochondroma and secondary peripheral atypical cartilaginous <span class=\"nowrap\">tumour/chondrosarcoma</span> grade I arising in osteochondroma can be difficult and should be made by a multidisciplinary team. The size of the cartilaginous cap is the most important parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Periosteal chondrosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less than one percent of chondrosarcomas arise on the surface of a bone and are designated periosteal (previously termed juxtacortical) chondrosarcomas. They most frequently affect adults in their 20s and 30s, and have a slight male predilection. The metaphyses of long bones are most frequently involved, especially of the distal femur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76662 \">figure 1</a>). Patients typically present with a palpable, painless, slowly growing mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/3,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35,36</a>].</p><p>Periosteal chondrosarcomas usually have a good prognosis after adequate local surgery despite histologic features of a high-grade lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/7,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,37-40</a>]. Histological grading is therefore not used at this location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Histologic appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite their different origin and location, primary and secondary chondrosarcomas appear histologically similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74562\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74562 \">picture 1</a>). At low magnification, there is abundant cartilage matrix production, and the irregularly shaped lobules of cartilage, often separated by fibrous bands, may permeate the bony trabeculae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Necrosis or mitoses may be seen in high-grade lesions. The histology of periosteal chondrosarcomas is similar except that the appearance is often more worrisome with increased cellularity and nuclear atypia.</p><p>The histologic (and radiographic) distinction between a benign cartilage lesion and an atypical cartilaginous <span class=\"nowrap\">tumour/chondrosarcoma</span> grade 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACT/CS1)</span> can be extremely difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/12,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,41,42</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> is hypercellular when compared to benign cartilage lesions. The chondrocytes appear mildly to moderately atypical and contain enlarged hyperchromatic nucleoli. Permeation of preexisting host bone and mucomyxoid matrix changes are important characteristics that can be used to separate <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> from an enchondroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Periosteal chondrosarcoma is distinguished from periosteal chondroma based upon size (&ge;5 cm) and the presence of cortical invasion. For phalangeal enchondromas, more worrisome histologic features are tolerated, and the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma at this site is based upon the presence of cortical destruction, soft tissue invasion, and mitoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Fortunately, the distinction between enchondroma and <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> is not always essential for clinical decision making, since treatment (curettage and adjuvant phenol application or cryosurgery) is often similar for enchondromas as well as central <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Rare chondrosarcoma subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to conventional central, peripheral, and periosteal chondrosarcomas, several rare subtypes are described, together constituting less than 10 percent of all chondrosarcomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas contain two juxtaposed components: a well-differentiated cartilage tumor (which can be either an enchondroma or a low-grade chondrosarcoma), and a high-grade non-cartilaginous sarcoma which most frequently is an osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, or an undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (previously termed malignant fibrous histiocytoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52315\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52315 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Both components appear to share some genetic aberrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>] with additional genetic changes in the high-grade component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. This suggests a common precursor cell with early divergence of the two components. Approximately 50 percent of dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas harbor mutations in <em>IDH1</em> or <em>IDH2</em>. These mutations are found in both components, confirming a common origin of both components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The average age at presentation is older (between 50 and 60 years) than in other chondrosarcoma subtypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50684 \">table 1</a>). The majority occur centrally in medullary bone; the most common sites of involvement are the pelvis, femur, and humerus. The typical presentation is with pain, although swelling, paresthesias, and pathologic fractures are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The majority of patients have an associated soft tissue mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas are biologically aggressive and they have a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/11,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,51-53</a>]. In a multicenter review of 337 patients, 71 (21 percent) had metastases at the time of diagnosis; they had a 10 percent chance of survival at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Even for patients without metastases at diagnosis, survival was only 28 percent at 10 years.

The light microscopic features of myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone are similar to those of the more commonly described extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC), a soft tissue sarcoma that most commonly arises in the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. However, these two entities are unrelated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], and the term &quot;chondrosarcoma&quot; to describe EMC is a misnomer. Well-formed hyaline cartilage is found only in a minority of EMCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>], while S100 expression (which is present in all or most chondrosarcomas) is often very focal or absent. Expression of collagen II and aggrecan (two other markers of cartilaginous differentiation) are absent in 86 percent of EMCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, the translocation t(9:22) that is specific for EMC is generally absent in so-called myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone, and its ultrastructure is different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/69,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,71</a>]. The reported cases of myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone that contain a proven translocation of t(9:22) have a large soft tissue component that makes distinction from EMC with secondary bone destruction extremely difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], although some convincing cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Research has uncovered some parallels between chondrocyte growth and differentiation in the normal growth plate and both benign and malignant cartilaginous tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>Within the normal growth plate, resting zone chondrocytes proliferate and differentiate, becoming hypertrophic. These cells undergo apoptosis, allowing the invasion of vessels and osteoblasts that start to form bone and lead to longitudinal bone growth. This physiologic process is tightly regulated by components of the Indian hedgehog <span class=\"nowrap\">(IHH)/parathyroid</span> hormone related (PTHRP) protein signaling pathway.</p><p>Patients with multiple osteochondromas (previously called hereditary multiple exostoses) have germline mutations in the exostosin (<em>EXT1</em> or <em>EXT2)</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>], with loss of the remaining wild type allele in the cartilage cap of the osteochondroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The end result is decreased EXT expression. Loss of expression of the <em>EXT</em> genes through homozygous deletion of <em>EXT1</em> is also seen in solitary osteochondromas that are unassociated with the hereditary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. The <em>EXT</em> gene products are involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are essential for cell signaling through <span class=\"nowrap\">IHH/PTHLH</span> and other pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>In osteochondromas where <em>EXT</em> is inactivated, the HSPGs seem to accumulate in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus instead of being transported to the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. This hampers multiple growth signaling pathways (including the <span class=\"nowrap\">IHH/PTHRP</span> protein pathways), which, as noted above, are important for normal chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation within the normal human growth plate.</p><p>In secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas arising in osteochondromas, EXT is usually wild type, suggesting that the wild type cells in osteochondroma are prone to malignant transformation through EXT independent mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Using a mouse model, it was shown that additional genetic alterations involving the TP53 or pRb pathway are involved in the progression from osteochondroma to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In addition, a role for IHH signaling has been suggested, although the data are not entirely consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/84-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-88</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PTHRP signaling, which is downstream of IHH and is involved in chondrocyte proliferation, is absent in osteochondromas, but upregulated with malignant transformation towards secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, especially in high-grade lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/85,86,89-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86,89-92</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is decreased expression of downstream targets in the IHH signaling cascade during tumor progression in peripheral chondrosarcomas, while they are still active in central chondrosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from in vitro and in vivo models show that treatment of central chondrosarcoma cells with recombinant Hedgehog increases proliferation, whereas treatment with Hedgehog signaling inhibitors inhibits tumor proliferation and growth in a small subset of tumors and chondrosarcoma cell cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/88,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,93,94</a>]. </p><p/><p>A multistep genetic model for the development of secondary (peripheral) chondrosarcomas has been proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51711 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>With regards to the molecular genetics of enchondromas and the far more common primary (central) chondrosarcomas, point mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 genes <em>IDH1</em> and <em>IDH2 </em>have been identified in 40 to 56 percent of cases, and seem to be an early event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/24,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,95</a>]. Also, Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are caused by somatic mosaic mutations in <em>IDH1</em> and <em>IDH2 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The identification of <em>IDH1</em> and <em>IDH2 </em>mutations in four chondrosarcoma cell lines provides an in vitro model to study the role of these mutations in tumorigenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle. Mutations in <em>IDH1</em> and <em>IDH2</em> cause elevated levels of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG), which competitively inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dependent enzymes, such as TET2, thereby inducing epigenetic changes, including DNA hypermethylation and histone modification, probably affecting differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Increased levels of D-2-HG promote chondrogenic and inhibit osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Thus, mutations in <em>IDH1</em> or <em>-2</em> lead to a local block in osteogenic differentiation during skeletogenesis, causing the development of benign cartilaginous tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Indeed, also in mice, mutant IDH or D-2-HG causes persistence of chondrocytes, giving rise to rests of growth-plate cells that persist in the bone as enchondromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>In addition, although <em>EXT</em> is not involved, involvement of the <span class=\"nowrap\">IHH/PTHLH</span> signaling pathway is suggested by the observations that PTHRP signaling is active in enchondromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/89,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,92</a>], and hedgehog signaling is active in central chondrosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Moreover, a mutation in the gene encoding the receptor for PTHRP (PTH-1 receptor or PTH1R) has been identified in enchondromatosis that is claimed to lead to constitutive activation of IHH signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/87,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,100</a>]. Three new heterozygous missense mutations have been described in the <em>PTH1R</em> gene in patients with Ollier disease, which result in reduced receptor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

The tumor has a mixed radiolucent and sclerotic appearance with the mineralized chondroid matrix appearing as a punctate or ring-and-arc pattern of calcifications that may coalesce to form a more radiopaque flocculent pattern of calcification (the so-called chondroid type of calcification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65087\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65087 \">image 6</a>)).

The cartilaginous cap is best assessed on T2-weighted MRI and should not exceed 1.5 to 2 cm. The thickness and appearance of the cap on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI provide a fairly reliable assessment of the likelihood of malignancy. A thickened cap and irregular distribution of vague calcifications suggest the development of a secondary chondrosarcoma.</p><p>Periosteal chondrosarcomas appear as a round to oval soft tissue mass on the surface of bone, containing typical chondroid matrix mineralization. They cause variable amounts of cortical bone erosion and appear to be covered by an elevated periosteum (Codman triangles). The medullary canal is typically not involved. The radiographic differentiation between a periosteal chondrosarcoma, periosteal osteosarcoma, and parosteal osteosarcoma can be difficult.</p><p>Clear cell chondrosarcomas have a predilection for the epiphyseal ends of the femur and humerus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76662 \">figure 1</a>).

On CT and MRI, dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas may be seen to contain two distinct areas with differing radiographic characteristics: the low-grade conventional chondrosarcomatous component has low attenuation on CT and high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI images, while the high-grade noncartilaginous component may have soft tissue attenuation on CT (isointense to muscle) and variable signal intensity on MRI T2-weighted images. There may be intraosseous lytic areas and an aggressive pattern of bone destruction with a moth-eaten or permeative pattern.

Given the low rate of metastases in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> (less than 10 percent), imaging of the lungs is generally not necessary. However, patients with intermediate and high-grade chondrosarcomas have a higher rate of metastatic disease (10 to 50 percent for grade 2 lesions and 50 to 70 percent for grade 3 lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. In these patients, the staging evaluation should at least include a thoracic CT to rule out the presence of pulmonary metastases.</p><p>As noted above, the place of PET scanning (which in other oncologic settings is generally more sensitive but less specific than CT for detection of metastatic disease) is uncertain. Although the use of PET can reveal sites of metastatic disease among patients with grade 2 or 3 chondrosarcomas, it is clear that sensitivity is lower than that of conventional CT for small lung metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. The utility of integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> has not been addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all grades and subtypes of nonmetastatic chondrosarcoma, surgical treatment offers the only chance for cure. The optimal type of surgical management depends upon histologic grade, location, and tumor extent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermediate and high-grade tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wide en bloc local excision is the preferred surgical treatment for all nonmetastatic intermediate- and high-grade chondrosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Depending on the location of the primary, wide excision can lead to considerable morbidity and may require a demanding reconstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-grade central tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of minimizing functional disability provides the rationale for pursuing less extensive surgery for <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> that are confined to the bone. In appropriately selected cases, extensive intralesional curettage, followed by local adjuvant chemical treatment (phenolization) or cryotherapy, and cementation or bone grafting of the cavity produces satisfactory long-term local control while minimizing the need for extensive reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/134-139\" class=\"abstract_t\">134-139</a>]. </p><p>The best outcomes are with small extremity conventional <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span>. For patients with large tumor size, intraarticular or soft tissue involvement, and the periosteal, clear cell, mesenchymal and dedifferentiated subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], intralesional excision represents an inadequate form of local treatment, with high rates of local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/3,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,140</a>]. Wide local resection is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p>For large tumors, curettage can be technically difficult, and sampling error may result in a focus of higher-grade disease being missed. The tumor size cutoff beyond which a wide resection is preferred has not been studied and is highly dependent on location.</p><p>Most authors also consider wide local excision to be the preferred treatment for a low-grade chondrosarcoma involving the axial skeleton and pelvis. Several (but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/8,64,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,64,141</a>]) reports note higher local recurrence rates with curettage or marginal excision of tumors at these sites, with a higher tendency to metastasize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/140-144\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-144</a>].</p><p>The decision to perform a curettage rather than wide local excision on the basis of a diagnostic biopsy is complicated by tumor heterogeneity and variation in histopathologic interpretation. A failure to recognize higher-grade areas in a predominantly low-grade chondrosarcoma is possible when a needle or limited open biopsy has been performed. Thus, a presumed <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> treated by curettage and local adjuvant treatment that is found to contain foci of intermediate- or high-grade differentiation on the final histologic sections might require additional surgery. In order to minimize this risk, the diagnostic biopsy should always be directed at the more aggressive-appearing areas on the radiographic studies (ie, the soft tissue components or the more diffusely enhancing regions with limited or no matrix mineralization). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Histologic grading and prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral chondrosarcomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a preexisting osteochondroma, complete surgical removal of the cartilage cap with the pseudocapsule provides excellent long-term clinical and local results. In one series of 107 patients with a tumor arising in solitary or multiple osteochondromas, five- and 10-year local recurrence rates after surgery were 16 and 18 percent, and the 10-year mortality rate was only 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of the 63 patients who had their primary treatment at the author's institution, 26 had wide excision (none of whom recurred), 36 had a marginal excision (ten of whom recurred locally), and the one patient who had an intralesional excision also developed a local recurrence. Of the 45 patients who received treatment for a local recurrence, 15 died of their disease.</p><p>When these tumors arise in the pelvis, the large cartilage cap can be difficult to excise, but outcomes are better if the excision is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/140,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,145</a>]. As an example, in a series of 61 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> or grade 2 secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma of the pelvis, local recurrence rates after wide local or incomplete excision were 3 versus 23 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of recurrent disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local recurrence of an <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> in the long bones compromises survival, and aggressive management is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. If the local recurrence is solitary, without progression in grade and located in the long bones, repeat intralesional resection with local adjuvant therapy is reasonable. </p><p>Local recurrence of an intermediate- or high-grade chondrosarcoma located in the long bones or recurrence of any grade histology in the flat bones is an indication for a wide excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>], although it is often challenging to reach adequate wide resection margins in these patients. Long-term survival is achievable in a substantial number of patients. In a series of 28 patients treated surgically for a recurrence of a chondrosarcoma of the extremities or pelvis (grade 1, 2, and 3 in 4, 61, and 33 percent, respectively), the post local recurrence survival rate was 59 percent at both five and 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. In multivariate analysis, the most important factors predicting a favorable long-term outcomes were age under 50 years and a local recurrence-free interval of one year or more.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As most chondrosarcomas are slow growing, with a relatively low fraction of dividing cells and radiation-related cytotoxicity is dependent upon cell division, chondrogenic tumors are considered relatively (but not absolutely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/148,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">148,149</a>]) radioresistant. Nevertheless, radiation therapy (RT) may be of benefit in two situations: after an incomplete resection of a high-grade conventional, dedifferentiated, or mesenchymal chondrosarcoma to maximize the likelihood of local control (potentially curative intent), and in situations where resection is not feasible or would cause unacceptable morbidity (palliative intent).</p><p>When RT is given with curative intent, doses in excess of 60 Gy are required to achieve local control. However, application of this dose with conventional high energy photons is often impossible in the vicinity of critical structures, especially in chondrosarcomas arising in the skull base and axial skeleton. Unfortunately, it is in this exact situation that postoperative RT is often indicated, as these tumors are less accessible for radical resection compared with lesions in the appendicular skeleton. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chordoma-and-chondrosarcoma-of-the-skull-base\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of RT can be illustrated by a series of 21 patients with primary chondrosarcoma of the spine who underwent 28 surgical procedures that included seven complete and 21 subtotal resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. The median survival for the entire group was six years, and the addition of RT to resection prolonged the median disease-free interval from 16 to 44 months. Others have shown a high rate of local control (90 percent) with the addition of neoadjuvant or adjuvant RT to surgical resection in a group of 60 patients with high-risk extracranial chondrosarcoma, of whom 50 percent had either an R1 (microscopically positive) or R2 (grossly positive margins) resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. </p><p>Palliative RT is also a reasonable option for local treatment of a primary or locally recurrent chondrosarcoma if resection is not feasible or would cause unacceptable morbidity. This is particularly true for mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, which, in our experience, are more radiosensitive than are other subtypes.</p><p>The benefit of RT in this setting can be illustrated by a retrospective review of 15 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (all but one nonmetastatic, most extraosseous) treated in several protocols of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. All patients had surgical resection, which was complete in eight; 13 received chemotherapy and six were irradiated. At a median follow-up of 9.6 years, four of seven incompletely resected patients were still alive, three of whom had been irradiated.</p><p>Conventional RT can sometimes provide local control and symptom relief for other histologies, as long as sufficient doses are administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/152,153\" class=\"abstract_t\">152,153</a>].</p><p>In an early report from MD Anderson of 20 patients with chondrosarcoma who were treated for cure, 5 of 11 patients who received RT as monotherapy achieved local control with doses from 40 to 70 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Charged particle irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the limitations of conventional photon irradiation, alternative radiation modalities have been tested. Unlike photons, which lack mass and charge, particle beams interact more densely with tissue, causing greater levels of ionization per unit length, and therefore, an increased radiobiologic effect (RBE). The most data are available for protons, but there is limited experience with carbon ions as well.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proton beam irradiation &ndash; The theoretical advantage of charged particle irradiation using protons is in its dose distribution. The physical characteristics of the proton beam result in the majority of the energy being deposited at the end of a linear track, in what is called a Bragg peak. The radiation dose falls rapidly to zero beyond the Bragg peak. Proton beam therapy permits the delivery of high doses of RT to the target volume while limiting the &quot;scatter&quot; dose received by surrounding tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Proton beam RT has been studied most for incompletely resected chondrogenic tumors of the skull base and axial skeleton. Local control rates of 78 to 100 percent with mixed photon-proton or proton only protocols (doses up to 79 cobalt Gray equivalents [CGE], or 7900 cGy) are reported by several authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/154-158\" class=\"abstract_t\">154-158</a>], with limited severe late effects (&lt;10 percent RTOG grade 3 toxicity). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chordoma-and-chondrosarcoma-of-the-skull-base\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbon ions &ndash; Carbon ions represent another attractive radiation modality, which combines the physical advantages of protons with a higher radiobiological activity. The available data are in patients treated for skull based chondrosarcomas, which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chordoma-and-chondrosarcoma-of-the-skull-base\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Although promising, these techniques are not widely available, in contrast to photon irradiation. Particle beam irradiation requires adaptation of particle accelerators designed for other purposes or specialized dedicated equipment.

Chemoresistance in these tumors may be attributable to several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most chondrosarcomas are slow-growing, with a relatively low fraction of dividing cells; most conventional chemotherapeutic agents act on actively dividing cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of the multidrug-resistance-1 gene, P-glycoprotein, by chondrosarcoma cells may also play a role in drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/159,160\" class=\"abstract_t\">159,160</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access of anticancer agents to the tumor may be hampered because of the large amount of extracellular matrix and the poor vascularity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High activity of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways (eg, high expression of Bcl-2 family members) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/161,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,162</a>].</p><p/><p>The benefit of chemotherapy for higher-grade (grade 2 or 3) chondrosarcomas is difficult to assess. Due to the rarity of chondrosarcomas in general and especially of intermediate and high-grade tumors, there are few prospective studies, and no randomized trials. The reported series are few in number, retrospective, and consist mainly of a small number of patients. Nevertheless, retrospective reports challenge the prevailing view that chondrosarcomas are entirely chemotherapy-resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/163,164\" class=\"abstract_t\">163,164</a>]. As with other cancers, the specific histology also dictates the degree of responsiveness of that sarcoma subtype. Regardless, outcomes remain generally poor overall with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, and there is a need for inclusion of these patients in prospective trials. As an example, it is hoped that novel therapeutics such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors will have an impact on this patient population, and these agents are under study, even though data from preclinical models have been disappointing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/165,166\" class=\"abstract_t\">165,166</a>] (see <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Novel therapies'</a> below). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no role for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who undergo surgical treatment for an <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span>.

However, benefit from chemotherapy in patients with nonmetastatic disease is not a universal observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/11,51,52,169\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,51,52,169</a>].</p><p>We suggest that eligible patients consider enrolling in clinical trials testing the value of adjuvant chemotherapy. As an example, patients with dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas are allowed in the EUROBOSS adjuvant chemotherapy trial of the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is modestly more sensitive to chemotherapy than other subtypes of chondrosarcoma, but the data are limited. In particular, limited experience with adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy in patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma suggests a potential benefit for chemotherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experience with 15 cases of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (all but one nonmetastatic, most extraosseous) was reported from the soft tissue and osteosarcoma study groups of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. All patients had surgical resection, which was complete in eight; 13 received chemotherapy and six were irradiated.

The authors concluded that these outcomes were better than expected, and attributed the improved outcomes to combined modality treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective series of 26 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma treated at the Rizzoli Institute included 24 surgically treated patients, 12 of whom received chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. After a median follow-up of 48 months, 10 remained alive.

However, even in the absence of prospective trials, there is modest clinical evidence from non-randomized trials that mesenchymal chondrosarcomas are sensitive to doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy as used in other bone tumors. Given these limited data, adjuvant chemotherapy in patients is a reasonable option for those patients who are medically fit, willing, and able to tolerate such therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable option, if the disease is locally advanced, to both gauge the genuine chemotherapy sensitivity of a specific primary tumor and to attempt to render a patient resectable when the disease is locally advanced.</p><p>The best regimen is equally controversial; prior clinical experience cited above and guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1858\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and ESMO indicate either an Ewing sarcoma-based multi-drug regimen or an osteosarcoma-type <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/cisplatin-based</span> chemotherapy regimen may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chondrosarcoma/abstract/169,171\" class=\"abstract_t\">169,171</a>].

Clinical behavior is variable and predicted by the histologic grade. Ninety percent are conventional chondrosarcomas, the majority of which are low-grade tumors that are slow growing with a low metastatic potential. High-grade chondrosarcomas, which include 5 to 10 percent of conventional chondrosarcomas as well as the dedifferentiated and mesenchymal subtypes, have a high metastatic potential and a poor prognosis following resection alone. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experienced assessment of radiographic imaging studies (conventional X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and computed tomography [CT]) and histopathologic grade as assessed on a diagnostic biopsy are used to guide treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic and staging work-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all grades and subtypes of nonmetastatic chondrosarcoma, surgical treatment offers the only chance for cure. The optimal type of surgical management depends upon histologic grade, location, and tumor extent. The goal of surgery is complete excision while minimizing functional disability. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For small, central <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1</span> involving an extremity that are confined to the bone, we suggest intralesional curettage with local adjuvant therapy (phenol application or cryosurgery followed by cementation or bone graft of the cavity) rather than wide local excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all other patients with intermediate or high-grade histology (including the mesenchymal and dedifferentiated subtypes), large tumor size, intraarticular or soft tissue involvement, periosteal or clear cell subtypes, a low-grade central chondrosarcoma in the pelvis or axial skeleton, or a peripheral chondrosarcoma, we recommend wide local resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locally recurrent chondrosarcomas should be managed aggressively, as they may be of higher histological grade than the original tumor, increasing the risk of metastases and fatal outcome. For nonmetastatic recurrence of an <span class=\"nowrap\">ACT/CS1,</span> we suggest repeat intralesional resection with local adjuvant therapy if the local recurrence is solitary, without progression in grade and located in the long bones (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Otherwise, wide local excision is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Management of recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of radiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most low-grade chondrosarcomas are considered relatively radioresistant, radiation therapy (RT) may be of benefit in two situations (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Radiotherapy'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally suggest adjuvant radiotherapy for incompletely excised high-grade conventional, dedifferentiated, or mesenchymal chondrosarcomas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Doses of more than 60 Gy are needed for maximal local control after incomplete resection, and depending on the tumor site, this may not be feasible with conventional photon beam irradiation. In such cases, referral for treatment using newer techniques, such as proton beam irradiation, is appropriate, where available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative RT is a reasonable option for local treatment of patients with a primary or locally recurrent chondrosarcoma if resection is not feasible or would cause unacceptable morbidity, as well as for those with symptomatic metastatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional low-grade and clear cell chondrosarcomas are chemotherapy-resistant. Chemotherapy is possibly effective in the mesenchymal subtype, particularly those that contain a high percentage of round cells, and is of uncertain value in dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma; both subtypes are rare and bear a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Systemic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no role for adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection of a conventional low-grade chondrosarcoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of chemotherapy after complete resection of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is unknown. Retrospective studies suggest that patients who are managed with surgery and chemotherapy have a better outcome than those managed with surgery alone. We recommend that eligible patients be enrolled on clinical trials testing adjuvant chemotherapy. If the protocol is not available or if patients are unable or unwilling to participate, we manage these patients on a case by case basis, discussing the risks and uncertain benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. If the high-grade component is an osteosarcoma, we treat the patient as per osteosarcoma protocols. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with completely resected mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, retrospective studies suggest that those with a substantial round cell component are sensitive to doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy. Retrospective analyses of relatively small numbers of patients suggest that adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy is a reasonable choice for such patients, as long as they are medically fit and able to tolerate the therapy; the limited data preclude a specific recommendation either for or against this practice. Initial induction chemotherapy is a reasonable option if the disease is locally advanced, and a response to therapy might increase the likelihood of complete resection or function-preserving surgery. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of conventional chemotherapy is limited in advanced disease, with the exception of mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, which exhibit modest responsiveness to chemotherapy. We suggest that patients be enrolled in clinical trials testing new strategies. If trial enrollment is not available or not feasible, we use a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> combination as is used for other bone sarcomas.
