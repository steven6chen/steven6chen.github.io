For unknown reasons, the right breast is involved more often than the left. Ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy is present in 30 to 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. There is some evidence that widespread mammographic screening for breast carcinoma is leading to increased incidental detection of lymphoma of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A less common but distinctive presentation is that of a young woman of childbearing age who presents during or immediately after pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Disease is often bilateral and may clinically mimic inflammatory breast cancer. Most of these women have highly aggressive, Burkitt lymphoma.</p><p>Breast lymphomas have been reported in men although they are rare. Systemic &quot;B&quot; symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, night sweats) are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Although all histologic types of lymphoma have been described, primary breast lymphomas are most commonly B cell lymphomas; approximately one-half are diffuse large B cell lymphoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59978 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].

Lymphocytes within the breast are thought to be a part of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Marginal zone B cell lymphomas (previously called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphomas) comprise 0 to 44 percent of primary breast lymphomas, and may present with or develop bilateral breast involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/3,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-18</a>].</p><p>Burkitt lymphomas of the breast are less common and, as noted above, are associated with a distinct clinical picture.

Uncontrolled studies suggest that women who have had silicone breast implants may have an increased relative risk, but extremely low absolute risk, of developing anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. In a population-based case-control study, the risk for primary breast ALCL in women with a cosmetic silicone breast prosthesis was estimated to be one to three cases per million, which was 18-fold higher than in women who did not have an implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Since primary breast lymphomas are not recognized as a distinct entity in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the literature is heterogenous in terms of staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. By definition, stage IE disease is limited to breast involvement only, and stage IIE disease is limited to the breast and ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/7,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31,32</a>]. However, some experts include lesions that have extended beyond the breast at the time of diagnosis if the breast is the first or major site of presentation, even with involvement of distal nodal sites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone marrow involvement.</p><p>Staging should be based upon a careful history and physical examination, appropriate imaging (computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, or integrated PET-CT), bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and laboratory studies (including a serum lactate dehydrogenase level). Assessment of the contralateral breast is essential since approximately 10 percent of cases are bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/6,13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,33</a>].

In a review of reported breast lymphoma cases, patients treated with mastectomy (156 patients), when compared with patients treated without mastectomy (297 patients), showed a trend toward lower survival (approximate 60-month overall survival of 45 versus 55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

There have been no prospective trials of CNS prophylaxis in this population. Case series have reported a high incidence of CNS recurrence in patients with DLBCL of the breast, estimated at 12 to 27 percent, but some patients with Burkitt lymphoma may have been included, resulting in an overestimation of the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. Nevertheless, given this high incidence of CNS recurrence, CNS prophylaxis should be considered.

Patients with Burkitt lymphoma require intensive, multiagent therapy, with CNS prophylaxis. Dose reduction should be avoided and therapy should be initiated quickly. There is no role for RT, even in patients with localized disease. The pretreatment evaluation and initial treatment of Burkitt lymphoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prognosis is dependent upon clinical stage and histologic type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/2,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,41</a>]. As with localized non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) at other sites, poor prognostic indicators include age greater than 60, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), stage II rather than stage I disease, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &ge;2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>A retrospective report of 50 patients with limited-stage primary breast NHL diagnosed from 1981 to 2009 included 16 patients (32 percent) with clinically indolent histologies and 34 patients (68 percent) with clinically aggressive histologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-lymphoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Of patients with stage I (81 percent) or stage II (19 percent) indolent lymphoma, most were managed with radiation therapy (75 percent) or observation (13 percent) with estimated five-year rates of lymphoma specific and overall survival of 91 and 75 percent, respectively. Of patients with stage I (62 percent) or stage II (38 percent) aggressive lymphoma, most patients were managed with chemotherapy plus radiation (41 percent) or chemotherapy alone (38 percent) with estimated five-year rates of lymphoma specific and overall survival of 71 and 54 percent, respectively.</p><p>Further information on the prognosis of various NHL subtypes is presented separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary lymphoma of the breast is rare.
