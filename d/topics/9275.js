For localized melanomas, surgical excision is curative in most cases, and patients at high risk of developing metastatic disease may benefit from adjuvant therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) was the first immunotherapy approach to produce durable remissions in patients with advanced disease. However, these benefits were limited to a small fraction of patients, and treatment was associated with substantial toxicity.</p><p>The use of high-dose IL-2 in melanoma has largely been replaced by immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors directed against programmed death-1 protein (PD-1) alone or in combination with antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). In addition, targeted therapy directed against the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway has provided an additional important treatment option for patients with advanced disease and a V600 mutation of <em>BRAF</em>.</p><p>The results with high-dose IL-2 and the potential role of other experimental immunotherapy approaches are reviewed here.</p><p>The principles of cancer immunotherapy and an overview of the treatment of metastatic melanoma are presented separately: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100471453\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERLEUKIN-2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IL-2 was first identified as a T-cell growth factor in 1976. Recombinant IL-2 subsequently was shown to have potent, dose-dependent immunomodulatory and antitumor activity in a number of murine tumor models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These observations led to the development of high-dose IL-2 regimens for use in patients with metastatic melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100471460\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial clinical studies used high-dose bolus recombinant IL-2 (600,000 to 720,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> intravenously every eight hours on days 1 to 5 and 15 to 19, with a maximum of 28 doses per course) either alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells.</p><p>Extended follow-up of 270 patients treated with high-dose IL-2 at the National Cancer Institute and the Cytokine Working Group institutions between 1985 and 1993 demonstrated that this approach had a clinically significant benefit in a minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The objective response rate was 16 percent, with a median duration of nine months (range 4 to 106+ months), and 59 percent of complete responders remained progression free at seven years. At a minimum follow-up of six years, 44 percent of all responders remained alive, the vast majority disease or progression free. In addition, no patient responding for longer than 30 months had progressed, suggesting that some patients were &quot;cured.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100471489\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severe multiorgan toxicity associated with high-dose IL-2 treatment limited its use to patients with excellent organ function who were treated by experienced clinicians in specialized programs capable of providing the necessary intensive care.</p><p>Serious side effects include hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, fever and chills, metabolic acidosis, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea and peripheral edema due to increased capillary permeability, neurotoxicity, oliguria and impaired renal function, rash, and rarely, death. Bacterial infection, particularly catheter-related sepsis, contributes significantly to the toxicity of IL-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Antibiotic prophylaxis greatly reduced the incidence of catheter-related sepsis and dramatically improved the safety of this therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160059790\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative IL-2 regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple approaches have been studied in an attempt to improve the durable response rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> minimize toxicity. In addition to alternative dosing schedules, these include combining IL-2 with activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (LAK cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], interferon alfa, peptide vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], chemotherapy (biochemotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and various toxicity reduction agents, such as <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/100136071&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/y3+Lj0shalBW+L1ZyL4trxJ3dXrX7K+7+lN6QItCYBdNNCg10j5UBmCMc2wxK+X/Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=15407\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">tumour necrosis factor receptor</a> (TNFR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonists. Although activity was seen with all of these approaches, none of these approaches resulted in a sufficient improvement in the therapeutic index to have them adopted as an alternative treatment regimen. Current work is focusing on modified IL-2 agents, such as NKTR-214, that are designed to preferentially activate CD8+ and natural killer (NK) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>High dose IL-2 has also been studied with autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and IL-2 plus TILs has been used in conjunction with lymphodepletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These approaches appeared to produce high response rates, including some durable complete responses, in patients who had previously had disease progression on IL-2 alone-based therapy. Ongoing research approaches include the use of gene-modified TILs and neoantigen-targeted TILs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100471510\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CYTOKINES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160060623\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon alfa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interferon alfa (IFNa) was the first recombinant cytokine used to treat metastatic melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, the usefulness of IFNa for patients with metastatic melanoma was limited, since tumor responses were largely confined to patients with small volumes of cutaneous or soft tissue disease, and the median duration of response was only approximately four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Immunotherapy with IFNa is no longer used for the treatment of advanced disease, and the development of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has replaced this agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552587183\"><span class=\"h2\">Granulocyte-macrophage-CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activates macrophages to become cytotoxic for human melanoma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and it mediates the proliferation, maturation, and migration of dendritic cells, which play an important role in the induction of T-cell-mediated immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>A cooperative group phase III trial (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 4697) did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival with GM-CSF compared with placebo or a peptide vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interleukin-2-and-experimental-immunotherapy-approaches-for-advanced-melanoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].
