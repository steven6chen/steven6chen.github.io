Vulvar lichen planus is a subtype of lichen planus that is characterized by erosive, papular, or hypertrophic lesions on the vulva, with or without concomitant vaginal involvement. </p><p>Erosive lichen planus (also known as mucosal lichen planus) can result in severe tissue destruction that leads to vulvar pain and urinary and sexual impairment. Erosive lichen planus also can affect other mucosal sites, such as the oral cavity, nasal mucosa, esophagus, larynx, conjunctiva, and urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>High quality studies to guide treatment of vulvar lichen planus are lacking. Superpotent topical corticosteroids are well accepted as the first-line treatment for erosive disease.</p><p>Vulvar lichen planus will be discussed here. Other clinical presentations of lichen planus are reviewed separately.

The incidence and prevalence of vulvar lichen planus has not been clearly established, but vulvar disease may be a common manifestation of lichen planus in women. In one series of 37 women diagnosed with lichen planus, vulvar lesions were present in 51 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20848761\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology is unknown. The characteristic skin lesions of lichen planus are thought to arise from a T-cell mediated autoimmune response against basal keratinocytes. The disorder is often associated with other autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar lichen planus often occurs in women 50 to 60 years of age, though younger and older women can be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Women with vulvar lichen planus frequently present with complaints of vulvar pain, burning, pruritus, soreness, or dyspareunia (sometimes with post-coital bleeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Another prominent symptom that may be present is an irritating vaginal discharge that does not respond to standard therapies for vaginitis. However, this clinical scenario is not specific to lichen planus, as it occurs with other vulvar disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55449 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The coexistence of vulvar lichen planus with cutaneous lichen planus, oral lichen planus, or lichen planopilaris (including frontal fibrosing alopecia) is common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76383%7EDERM%2F63590%7EDERM%2F76338%7EDERM%2F62826%7EDERM%2F90009%7EDERM%2F90010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76383 graphicRef63590 graphicRef76338 graphicRef62826 graphicRef90009 graphicRef90010 \">picture 1A-F</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/3,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-12</a>].

A minority of women are asymptomatic or have only minimal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Four types of lichen planus affect the vulva: erosive lichen planus, papulosquamous lichen planus, hypertrophic lichen planus, and lichen planopilaris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Erosive lichen planus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erosive lichen planus is the most common type of vulvar lichen planus seen in the secondary care setting. The desquamative, erosive, chronic dermatitis often also involves the vagina. Recurrent exacerbations, slow healing, and scarring are common. Scarring can cause significant anatomic disruption, including severe stenosis of the vagina and urethral obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96570 \">picture 2</a>). Dyspareunia, apareunia, difficulty with urination, and dysuria are the major symptoms.</p><p>Lesions are characterized by glazed, brightly erythematous erosions with white striae or a serpentine white border along the margin (Wickham striae) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96571%7EOBGYN%2F60224\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96571 graphicRef60224 \">picture 3A-B</a>). Occasionally, a violaceous border is noted. The lesions may occur on the labia minora and vestibule as isolated lesions on an otherwise normal vulva, or they may be associated with marked architectural destruction, including loss of the labia minora and narrowing of the introitus. Small, localized lesions on the labia majora are less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Anal involvement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal involvement </strong>&ndash; Vaginal involvement has been reported in up to 70 percent of patients with erosive lichen planus; in contrast, vaginal involvement is rare in lichen sclerosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-sclerosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen sclerosus&quot;</a>). The vaginal epithelium in lichen planus is friable, easily bleeding upon speculum insertion or with coitus. It may have small areas of inflammation and increased vaginal discharge, or it may be massively inflamed and denuded with a seropurulent exudate, pseudomembrane, or serosanguinous vaginal discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>]. In severe cases, adhesions and synechiae develop, which can lead to narrowing or obliteration of the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vaginal involvement can occur in the absence of any vulvar involvement, and vaginal <span class=\"nowrap\">synechiae/adhesions</span> can form in the absence of any symptomatology if the patient is not sexually active or menstruating.

Although all three areas can be affected, the lesions may not be concurrent. The gingival epithelium is usually involved, and erosions, white plaques, or a whitish and lace-like reticular pattern may occur on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and palate. Scarring and stricture formation are common and a major cause of long-term morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. VVG is particularly resistant to treatment.</p><p/><p>Erosive lichen planus also can affect other mucosal sites, such as the nasal mucosa, esophagus, larynx, conjunctiva, and urethra; concomitant involvement in these sites is often missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H435344595\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Papulosquamous lichen planus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Papulosquamous lichen planus consists of small, intensely pruritic papules with a violaceous hue that arise on keratinized and perianal skin. It is associated, occasionally, with milky striae on the inner aspects of the labia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Resolution of papulosquamous lesions is often followed by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrophic lichen planus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertrophic lichen planus characteristically exhibits hyperkeratotic, rough lesions on the perineum and perianal region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62561\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62561 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The appearance is similar to vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive squamous cell carcinoma. This type of lichen planus is rare and can be difficult to diagnose clinically because it resembles other hypertrophic vulvar lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436567637\"><span class=\"h2\">Lichen planopilaris</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lichen planopilaris is an uncommon follicular variant of lichen planus that presents with perifollicular erythema and hyperkeratosis as well as scarring alopecia. It typically presents on the scalp; however, a patient with lichen planopilaris on the labia majora and mons pubis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Erythematous erosions with a glazed appearance on the vulva demonstrating Wickham striae (white striae within involved areas or a serpentine white border) are highly suggestive of erosive lichen planus and pruritic violaceous papules are consistent with the papulosquamous variant, particularly when accompanied by papulosquamous lichen planus in other body sites and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. However, a biopsy of lesions suspicious for erosive vulvar lichen planus or papulosquamous vulvar lichen planus should be obtained to rule out other disorders if there is any uncertainty regarding the clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A biopsy is usually indicated in patients with suspected hypertrophic lichen planus because this variant can closely resemble squamous cell carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H973562\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to examination of the vulva and vagina, the physical examination of patients with suspected vulvar lichen planus should include an evaluation of other mucosal and cutaneous surfaces, including the oral cavity, scalp, nails, anus, and entire skin surface. Patients with vulvar lichen planus frequently have other manifestations of lichen planus, and the detection of lichen planus in other body areas increases suspicion for the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76383%7EDERM%2F63590%7EDERM%2F76338%7EDERM%2F62826%7EDERM%2F90009%7EDERM%2F90010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76383 graphicRef63590 graphicRef76338 graphicRef62826 graphicRef90009 graphicRef90010 \">picture 1A-F</a>). Examination of the oral cavity also allows for the detection of patients with the vulvo-vaginal-gingival (VVG) syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planus#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planus&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Erosive lichen planus'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinical evaluation should also include a review of systems for signs or symptoms suggestive of involvement of hidden mucosal areas, such as the nasal mucosa, esophagus (eg, dysphagia, odynophagia), larynx (eg, hoarseness, stridor), conjunctiva (eg, foreign body sensation or visual changes), urethra (eg, hematuria, dysuria), and anus. Erosive lichen planus in these areas often is not recognized, and can result in functional impairments if untreated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973562\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A biopsy is usually recommended for vulvar lichen planus, particularly in the erosive and hypertrophic forms of disease. Patients with classic clinical features of papulosquamous lichen planus (ie, small, violaceous, pruritic papules) may not require a biopsy for confirmation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>The identification of classic histologic features of lichen planus in biopsy specimens from patients with clinical features suggestive of vulvar lichen planus confirms the diagnosis. Classic histologic features of lichen planus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular acanthosis of the epidermis (in sites of keratinized skin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vacuolar change of the epidermal basal cell layer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A band&ndash;like dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes in the upper dermis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apoptotic keratinocytes scattered within the epidermis</p><p/><p>In addition, plasma cells are often present in biopsy specimens from mucosal lesions.</p><p>However, the failure to detect classic histologic features of lichen planus in patients with vulvar disease does not rule out the diagnosis. Classic histologic features of lichen planus are identified in only 70 to 80 percent of patients with vulvar lichen planus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/7,11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,26</a>]. </p><p>A 4 mm punch biopsy of an involved area is performed to obtain tissue for histologic examination. In patients with erosive disease, typical features of lichen planus are most likely to be found at the margins of ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, a specimen taken from a site of erosive disease should include intact epithelium adjacent to the ulcer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunofluorescence studies are typically reserved for erosive presentations in which an autoimmune blistering disease is in the differential diagnosis. If performed, direct immunofluorescence of vulvar lichen planus may show shaggy staining of the basement membrane zone, suggesting deposition of fibrinogen, IgM, cytoid bodies, and, occasionally, granular IgG or IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973432\"><span class=\"h2\">Proposed diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although additional study is necessary to validate diagnostic criteria for the various presentations of vulvar lichen planus, the lack of a defined set of diagnostic criteria stimulated a 2012 electronic Delphi consensus exercise that attempted to identify the important diagnostic features of erosive lichen planus of the vulva through a series of surveys administered to a multidisciplinary group of 73 experts in vulvovaginal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Most of the literature on lichenoid drug eruptions focuses on cutaneous lichenoid drug eruptions (the most common form of lichenoid drug eruption) and oral lichenoid drug eruptions. There is a paucity of data on drug-induced lichenoid eruptions of the vulva leaving uncertainty about the relationship between drugs and this presentation of disease.

In the study, a variety of topical corticosteroid therapies were used for initial treatment, with most patients receiving either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> 0.05% ointment or a combined preparation containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasone</a> butyrate, oxytetracycline, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nystatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nystatin</a>.

Our typical treatment plan is as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient performs nightly application of a super high-potency topical corticosteroid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% ointment or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=halobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">halobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% ointment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 3</a>)) to the affected area. As a guide, half of one finger-tip-unit (the amount of ointment expressed from a tube with a nozzle of 5 mm in diameter, applied from the distal skin-crease to the tip of the index finger) should be sufficient to cover both labia majora and minora and the perianal skin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient returns for clinical reevaluation of the response after two to three months:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is satisfactory improvement (ie, symptom resolution and healing of all erosions), we commence maintenance therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If no improvement is evident after eight weeks with persistent erosions, treatment with a systemic glucocorticoid or systemic glucocorticoid-sparing agent may be required. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Maintenance therapy is necessary after remission is achieved because symptoms often recur once treatment is discontinued. The goal of the maintenance phase is to maintain improvement while reducing the frequency and potency of topical corticosteroid treatment to minimize risk for local corticosteroid side effects. This is performed as a stepwise process that eventually reveals the lowest dose and frequency that sustains remission. </p><p>The first step in the transition to a maintenance regimen is usually the reduction of the frequency of application of the superpotent topical corticosteroid from application every night to application every other night. Treatment is tailored to the patient's response; most patients need to continue application of a topical corticosteroid one to three times per week indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Consultation with a dermatologist can be helpful for managing topical corticosteroid therapy. Lower-potency topical corticosteroids may also be utilized, as can combination preparations containing both a topical corticosteroid and an antimicrobial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If relapse occurs during the maintenance phase, we restart treatment with a superpotent topical corticosteroid nightly, as in the initial course of treatment. Once the disease is in remission, we taper the frequency and potency of treatment to the lowest effective maintenance regimen.</p><p>Skin atrophy is a potential side effect of topical corticosteroid therapy that is most likely to occur with the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids on areas of relatively thin skin; however, the vulvar area is relatively resistant to corticosteroid side effects. The least intense topical corticosteroid regimen for long-term maintenance treatment is preferred. The adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are reviewed in greater detail separately.

Our instructions for use of topical tacrolimus aim to minimize the burning sensation that may occur early in the course of treatment. Although most of the literature on topical tacrolimus therapy for vulvar lichen planus describes the use of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, we usually initiate treatment with tacrolimus 0.03% ointment in an attempt to improve tolerance.

Daily sitz baths for the first week of therapy or application of topical tacrolimus on top of a layer of petrolatum or a topical corticosteroid ointment for the first few weeks of treatment also can help alleviate burning.</p><p>We typically reevaluate patients for initial signs of a response to treatment after one to two months, and if the 0.03% formulation is tolerated, the dose can be increased to 0.1% ointment. Once remission is achieved, the frequency of application is gradually reduced to a maintenance regimen, which in some patients may be application one to three times per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91432\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe erosive lichen planus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with severe erosive vulvar lichen planus that prevents the application of topical therapy due to pain may benefit from an alternative initial approach to treatment.

Once symptoms improve, treatment is gradually tapered to the lowest frequency sufficient to maintain disease control. Monitoring tacrolimus drug levels is unnecessary with topical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972370\"><span class=\"h3\">Adhesions and scarring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar or vaginal involvement by lichen planus can lead to anatomic distortion and functional limitations secondary to the formation of adhesions and scarring. Dilators and surgery can be useful for improving these complications after mucosal inflammation is controlled with medical therapy. Follow-up care is necessary to maintain benefit after these procedures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dilators </strong>&ndash; Dilator therapy (with rigid dilators) can be effective for distending mild to moderate vaginal synechiae that interfere with intromission or speculum insertion. We determine the correct dilator size during an office visit and show the patient how to insert it and then have her demonstrate that she can perform the insertion. Application of topical 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> around the vaginal orifice 15 minutes before insertion and application of a lubricant such as petrolatum to the dilator can be helpful. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our experience, the dilator should be used several times per week, for 5 to 10 minutes, with the woman gently rotating the dilator during this time. Once she can comfortably insert the dilator at home (typically after about three months of regular use), she should commence using the next larger size of dilator. Medical maintenance therapy for vaginal lichen planus (eg, intravaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>) should be continued during dilator treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once satisfactory vaginal dilatation has been achieved, use of a dilator can be continued two to three times weekly to maintain a patent, functional vagina. Women who are able to resume weekly intercourse may be able to stop dilator use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery </strong>&ndash; Severe vaginal synechiae require surgical release. All surgical approaches to vaginal occlusion must be followed by diligent therapy with dilators, topical therapy to maintain control of the inflammation of lichen planus, topical estrogen, and topical corticosteroids. Isolated vaginal procedures without this follow-up therapy invariably result in recurrent vaginal occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although topical estrogen has no therapeutic role in treatment of the lichen planus, its contribution to epithelial integrity of the vagina cannot be underestimated. Many women with lichen planus are postmenopausal, making the estrogen an important adjunct to restore suppleness, elasticity and moisture to the area.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461078649\"><span class=\"h3\">Emerging therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be an emerging treatment option for vulvar and vaginal lichen planus. A observer-blinded randomized trial that compared one session of vulvovaginal hexyl 5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL)-PDT to daily application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 5% ointment (with or without intravaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> acetate 1% foam) in 40 women with genital erosive lichen planus found similar mean reductions in clinical scores in the PDT and corticosteroid groups after six weeks (25 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. PDT is painful; all patients were sedated during treatment. Additional study is needed to confirm the efficacy of PDT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of hypertrophic and papulosquamous lichen planus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertrophic and papulosquamous lichen planus involving the vulva is more responsive to therapy than erosive lichen planus. A two-week course of a moderate or superpotent topical corticosteroid, as described above, usually results in complete remission or significant improvement of the disease. The adjunctive measures used for erosive vulvar lichen planus are also employed for hypertrophic and papulosquamous disease. (See <a href=\"#H87080\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive measures'</a> above.)</p><p>Hyperkeratotic lesions may fail to respond well to topical corticosteroids due to the limited ability of the drugs to penetrate a thickened stratum corneum. We have found intralesional corticosteroid therapy useful for these cases. The procedure is similar to that used for vulvar lichen sclerosus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-sclerosus#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen sclerosus&quot;, section on 'Topical corticosteroids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of vulvo-vaginal-gingival syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvovaginal disease is treated as discussed above. Treatment of oral lesions is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-lichen-planus-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral lichen planus: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of concurrent infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An associated bacterial or fungal infection should be treated with antimicrobials concurrently with corticosteroid therapy. Antibiotic selection should be based upon culture and sensitivity results. We prescribe oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> for vulvar candidiasis to avoid the irritant effects of topical creams. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-vulvovaginitis-treatment#H2693174985\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida vulvovaginitis: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Recurrent treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women report improvement or resolution of symptoms with initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/6,7,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,66</a>]. Symptomatic improvement corresponds with healing of erosions and reticulation on physical examination, but scarring is not reversible. As an example, a series in which 89 women with erosive lichen planus of the vulva were treated with 0.05% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> ointment reported 71 percent had a good response, 24 percent had a partial response, and 5 percent had a poor response to initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lichen-planus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The response rate was similar during maintenance therapy. A reliable estimate of the efficacy of second-line therapies could not be made because each agent was used by only one to seven patients.</p><p>Burning and itching that persist after therapy and despite the clinical appearance of skin improvement suggest superimposed vulvar pain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vulvodynia (vulvar pain of unknown cause)&quot;</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The four types of vulvar lichen planus are erosive lichen planus, papulosquamous lichen planus, hypertrophic lichen planus, and lichen planopilaris. Clinical manifestations include irritating vaginal discharge, vulvar soreness, intense pruritus, burning, and dyspareunia. A few patients are asymptomatic or have only minimal symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erosive lichen planus is the most severe form of vulvar lichen planus and can result in marked architectural destruction, including loss of the labia minora and narrowing of the introitus. The vagina is often involved, as well. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Erosive lichen planus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of vulvar lichen planus is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical manifestations and biopsy findings. A biopsy is recommended for all patients with suspected erosive or hypertrophic lichen planus. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of all chronic vulvar disorders requires patient education, behavioral modification, support, and medication. (See <a href=\"#H87080\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women with erosive vulvar lichen planus, we suggest a superpotent topical corticosteroid for first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients who present with severe erosive vulvar lichen planus that prevents the application of topical therapy may be given oral or intramuscular glucocorticoids as initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H969799\" class=\"local\">'Erosive vulvar lichen planus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with vaginal lichen planus, we suggest intravaginal corticosteroids given as foam or suppositories as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other therapeutic options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> suppositories and systemic glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal involvement with lichen planus can lead to the formation of adhesions and scarring. After mucosal inflammation is controlled with medical therapy, dilators and surgery can be useful for improving these complications.
