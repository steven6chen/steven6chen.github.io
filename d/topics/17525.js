Injury and poisoning is also the leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for over 7 million ED visits in 2010, which is over one quarter of the 25.5 million ED visits for children less than 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Blunt injury accounts for approximately 90 percent of all pediatric trauma. When blunt force is applied to a child's small body, multisystem trauma occurs frequently. Although the majority of injuries are mild to moderate in severity, the clinician caring for children should be prepared to rapidly evaluate and manage those patients with serious and life threatening trauma. In addition, children have differing anatomy and physiology from adults that require specific attention during advanced trauma care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial approach to the management of the unstable child with major traumatic injuries is presented here. The approach to the initially stable child with traumatic injury and the classification of trauma in the injured child are discussed separately.

The ATLS protocols are based on the concept of the Trimodal Death Distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first peak of death occurs in the seconds to minutes immediately after injury and only prevention can impact this mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second peak occurs in the minutes to hours after injury.

Knowledge of normal vital signs by age and awareness of the ability of children to sustain major hemorrhage without hypotension facilitates recognition of the critically injured child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).

In order to appropriately triage the management of the trauma patient, one useful method to categorize injuries uses the following parameters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of trauma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury extent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple trauma is defined by apparent injury to two or more body areas. Localized trauma involves only one anatomic region (eg, head and neck, chest and back, abdomen, extremities) of the body. Sometimes the extent of injury may be obvious; at other times this may not be readily apparent, and the clinical picture may evolve over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expected injuries differ based on whether they occur as a result of blunt trauma (eg, fall, motor vehicle collision [MVC]) or penetrating trauma (eg, gunshot, stabbing, shrapnel from explosion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of injury and physical examination findings are useful in the determination of severity. Assessment of severity will dictate the initial management and disposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. High risk trauma mechanisms predict patients who are more likely to be unstable or become unstable and, along with vital signs and physical findings, are often used to guide prehospital transport decisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57153\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57153 \">table 5</a>).

Achieving these goals requires a systematic and logical approach according to the tenets of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), presented below in an expanded format to emphasize the importance of performing specific procedures rapidly in the emergency department (ED) and the crucial need to continuously reassess vital functions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary survey (rapid primary evaluation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resuscitation of vital functions (eg, airway, breathing, circulation, mentation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Utilization of adjuncts to the primary survey and resuscitation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary survey (more comprehensive secondary assessment)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continued post resuscitation monitoring with further resuscitation as needed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Utilization of adjuncts to the secondary survey</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transition to definitive care</p><p/><p>Management of seriously injured children relies on two key principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment and management occur simultaneously during the primary survey.

In reality, particularly when multiple clinicians are involved, many steps typically occur simultaneously.</p><p>Organization of the medical response around the concept of a pediatric trauma team may provide more timely identification of injury and more rapid treatment with improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The next section will discuss each of the key elements of the primary survey as if they were distinct entities occurring in a strict sequence, even though in centers with optimal pediatric trauma resources these steps typically occur simultaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY SURVEY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The order of priority in the initial assessment and treatment in ATLS is called the &quot;primary survey&quot; and includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A - Airway maintenance with cervical spine protection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B - Breathing and ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C - Circulation with hemorrhage control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D - Disability (evaluation of neurologic status)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E - Exposure (complete <span class=\"nowrap\">visualization)/environmental</span> control (prevention of hypothermia)</p><p/><p>During the primary survey, clinicians must identify and promptly address life-threatening conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). Prior to the arrival of the patient, care providers should don eye protection, mask, gown, and gloves to prevent exposure to patient secretions (universal precautions). The care of the patient proceeds more effectively if participants know their role beforehand and if the leader of the resuscitation communicates clearly.</p><p>In trauma centers, advance notice to all participants and key units (eg, blood bank, operating room) facilitates collaborative and timely care of the critically injured child.</p><p>Upon arrival of the patient, clinicians should place the appropriate monitors, obtain vital signs (pulse, respirations, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, temperature), and provide supplemental oxygen. It is imperative for the trauma provider to assess pediatric vital signs in comparison to a readily available reference of normal values for age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The list below provides a brief overview of the approach and a more detailed discussion of each major category follows. Use of a trauma flow sheet with a dedicated recorder helps ensure that all aspects of assessment and care receive attention.</p><p>In the clinical setting, particularly when multiple clinicians are involved, many steps occur simultaneously. For example, IV access may precede chest tube placement, even though &quot;breathing&quot; comes before &quot;circulation&quot; in the algorithm. Also, clinical events will dictate the exact sequence of assessment and management. Some conditions are difficult to detect in young children based on physical findings (eg, cardiac tamponade), and others may evolve over time. For instance, a patient with initially symmetric breath sounds may become cyanotic in the middle of the secondary survey while receiving positive pressure ventilation and require an immediate thoracostomy tube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway with cervical spine motion restriction</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway assessment</strong> &ndash; Airway obstruction with hypoxia and inadequate ventilation is the most common cause of pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest following trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The clinician must rapidly determine airway patency, presence of foreign bodies in the mouth or pharynx, and evidence for <span class=\"nowrap\">facial/mandibular</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">tracheal/laryngeal</span> fractures with potential for an unstable airway. Medical providers must remain alert for the potential loss of the airway. A patient who is able to cry or speak normally is unlikely to have impending airway obstruction, but should be reevaluated frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

During the initial management, the clinician must assume a cervical spine injury in the patient with multiple trauma, especially with <span class=\"nowrap\">head/neck</span> injury or with an altered level of consciousness. Padding under the shoulder and back and use of the &quot;sniffing position&quot; is important to open the airway maximally and maintain a neutral cervical spine position in the infant or young child. Note that this positioning is markedly different from adults where padding under the head is frequently required to achieve neutral cervical spine position.

Of these, tranexamic acid has undergone the most use in adult trauma patients and has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality when given within three hours of blunt or penetrating trauma but an increased risk of death from hemorrhage if administered after three hours.

In a single observational study of 22 children with significant hemorrhage with expected transfusion requirements of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in 12 hours or 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> within 24 hours and who were transfused per protocol with a goal of achieving a ratio of 1:1:1 for transfusion of FFP, PRBCs, and platelets, mortality was similar despite a higher severity of injury when compared with 33 patients who received uncrossed-matched blood but were not placed on the massive transfusion protocol (45 percent for both groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

For example, controlled hypotension may be beneficial in patients with hemorrhagic shock due to torso injuries from gunshot or stab wounds. In this setting, titrating fluid resuscitation to regain a peripheral pulse but to maintain hypotension may allow lacerated blood vessels to spasm, form thrombus, and preserve blood volume prior to definitive surgical exploration and hemorrhage control. On the other hand, aggressive fluid administration prior to hemorrhage control in patients with penetrating trauma might, via augmentation of blood pressure, dilution of clotting factors, and production of hypothermia, disrupt thrombus formation and worsen bleeding. However, little data exists for this approach in children.

However, the sensitivity of an AP radiograph for pelvic fractures in children is limited, especially in patients younger than two years of age. Patients with negative plain radiographs in whom pelvic fracture is suspected should undergo computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis once they are stable or, if performed, along with an abdominal CT.

The primary utility of this examination for the unstable trauma patient is the detection of hemopericardium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraperitoneal fluid secondary to intraabdominal injury (IAI). </p><p>We suggest FAST examination in hemodynamically unstable pediatric trauma patients as a means to identify pericardial effusion or intraabdominal hemorrhage and to focus further management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>].

FAST may also have utility in a neurologically unstable child who is multiply injured and requires emergency surgery for an epidural hematoma. In this instance, a positive FAST examination may support the need for a laparoscopy or laparotomy at the time of craniotomy when there may not be time for other advanced imaging. </p><p>The utility of FAST for hemodynamically stable children with blunt abdominal trauma and no other injury that requires emergency surgery is less clear:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although FAST has been associated with improved outcomes in adult trauma patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174579\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Clinical studies'</a>), its use in the evaluation of children is not routine because the nature of pediatric injuries, primarily the common presence of solid organ lacerations, makes FAST an insensitive means for detecting important IAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, in a metaanalysis of 25 studies (over 3,800 injured children), FAST had a sensitivity of 66 percent and a specificity of 95 percent for the detection of hemoperitoneum using computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Given this low sensitivity, hemodynamically stable children with a moderate to high pretest probability for IAI warrant abdominal CT, regardless of findings on FAST.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FAST may also <strong>not</strong> have an impact on potentially important clinical outcomes or resource use in hemodynamically stable children with a low clinical suspicion for IAI. For example, in an unblinded randomized trial of 925 hemodynamically stable children evaluated for blunt torso trauma at a single center, FAST was <strong>not</strong> associated with significant differences in missed IAI (0 to 0.2 percent), frequency of abdominal CT (52 to 55 percent), mean emergency department length of stay (six hours), and hospital charges compared to standard care without FAST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Negative results on ultrasonography did lower the clinical suspicion for IAI by managing physician but did not decrease the use of abdominal CT. However, the study did not provide a specified approach to positive or negative FAST results and the sensitivity of FAST in this study (33 percent) was low compared to prior studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>Given the significant potential for false negative results, FAST alone should <strong>not</strong> be used to limit the use of abdominal CT in stable children with blunt abdominal trauma. On the other hand, observational evidence suggests that a negative FAST combined with normal liver transaminase values (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) may achieve adequate sensitivity to permit observation instead of abdominal CT, especially in children judged to be at low risk for intraabdominal injury although further study is needed. As an example, in a retrospective registry study of 400 pediatric trauma patients who had liver transaminases, FAST, and abdominal CT, combining FAST and liver enzyme results significantly increased sensitivity and specificity over FAST alone (50 versus 88 percent for sensitivity and 91 versus 98 percent for specificity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urinary catheter should be placed to monitor urinary output and to obtain urine for diagnostic testing.

Those children who do not respond to fluid resuscitation require direct operative intervention; a FAST examination may be helpful in characterizing the injury in this situation. Those who become hemodynamically stable after fluid repletion should have an abdominal CT performed. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma)'</a> above.)</p><p>A low risk rule for intraabdominal injury can identify children and adolescents who may undergo emergency department observation rather than abdominal and pelvic CT and is discussed in detail separately.

The routine use of oral contrast is controversial; it is rarely of benefit in the diagnosis of acute distal bowel injuries, but may be helpful in the diagnosis of duodenal and pancreatic injuries. The use of oral contrast media can increase scanning time and cause vomiting although low rates of aspiration have been documented in retrospective studies. In addition, oral contrast may inadequately penetrate the small or large bowel. For these reasons, many trauma centers no longer use oral contrast.

Because optimal care and outcomes occur when the critically injured child is initially resuscitated and subsequently managed in a pediatric trauma center (PTC), it is preferable to provide initial care in such facilities from the outset, whenever possible, or to arrange transfer to a PTC for ongoing management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. In a study of almost 30,000 adolescents (15 to 19 years of age) reported to a large trauma registry, patients cared for at adult and mixed trauma centers had higher mortality on adjusted analysis than those treated at pediatric trauma centers (OR 4.2 and 6.7, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
