According the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) Annual Report, there were almost 14,000 exposures to anticholinergic substances including plants, drugs and antispasmodics in 2015 (624 plants (5 major, or severe, exposures), 10,345 drugs (21 major), and 2879 antispasmodics (13 major)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Despite the large number of recorded cases, only 39 of these anticholinergic exposures were associated with major effects and there were no fatalities. This demonstrates a significant improvement in outcomes compared to previous data in which there were 51 deaths reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The basic mechanisms, presentation, and management of anticholinergic poisoning are reviewed here.

These may be marketed as &quot;natural&quot; remedies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Jimson weed contains significant concentrations of belladonna alkaloids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyoscyamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyoscyamine</a>, hyoscine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a>).

Muscarinic receptors are found on peripheral postganglionic cholinergic nerves in smooth muscle (intestinal, bronchial, and cardiac), the secretory glands (salivary and sweat), the ciliary body of the eye, and the central nervous system (CNS). Anticholinergic agents do not antagonize the effects at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, such as at the neuromuscular junction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of anticholinergic toxicity varies depending on the particular toxin, but usually occurs within one to two hours of oral ingestion. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and achieves peak plasma concentrations within two hours. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenoxylate-and-atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diphenoxylate-atropine</a> (eg, Lomotil) is an antidiarrheal agent that may present with toxicity up to 12 hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Toxicity from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> may persist for over a day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic description of anticholinergic intoxication is well known:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Red as a beet&quot; &ndash; Cutaneous vasodilation occurs as a means to dissipate heat by shunting blood to the skin, in order to compensate for the loss of sweat production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Dry as a bone&quot; (anhidrosis) &ndash; Sweat glands are innervated by muscarinic receptors, so anticholinergic medications produce dry skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Hot as a hare&quot; (anhydrotic hyperthermia) &ndash; Interference with normal heat dissipation mechanisms (ie, sweating) frequently leads to hyperthermia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Blind as a bat&quot; (nonreactive mydriasis) &ndash; Muscarinic input contributes to both pupillary constriction and effective accommodation. Anticholinergic medications generally produce pupillary dilation and ineffective accommodation that frequently manifests as blurry vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Mad as a hatter&quot; (delirium; hallucinations) &ndash; Blockade of muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) accounts for these findings. Manifestations may include: anxiety, agitation, dysarthria, confusion, disorientation, visual hallucinations, bizarre behavior, delirium, psychosis (usually paranoia), coma, and seizures. Hallucinations are often described as &quot;Alice in Wonderland-like&quot; or &quot;Lilliputian type,&quot; where people appear to become larger and smaller. Patients with altered mental status often present with agitation and may appear to grab invisible objects from the air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although central and peripheral anticholinergic effects are commonly seen together, in some cases, central effects may persist after resolution of peripheral symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Full as a flask&quot; &ndash; The detrusor muscle of the bladder and the urethral sphincter are both under muscarinic control; anticholinergic substances reduce detrusor contraction (thereby reducing or eliminating the desire to urinate) and prevent normal opening of the urethral sphincter (contributing to urinary retention).</p><p/><p>Other clinical features not included in the above mnemonic include tachycardia, which is the earliest and most reliable sign of anticholinergic toxicity, and decreased or absent bowel sounds.</p><p>Clinicians should be aware of the risk for chronic anticholinergic toxicity. Patients treated chronically with multiple psychiatric medications that possess anticholinergic effects, may present with more subtle findings (eg, confusion, alteration in mental status) consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. Such patients may not manifest all aspects of anticholinergic toxicity and their symptoms may be wrongly attributed to other diagnoses. Clinicians should be aware of psychotropic agents and other classes of medications with anticholinergic properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110058\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110058 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any substance or condition that produces an alteration in mental status, tachycardia, urinary retention, or seizure should be included in the differential diagnosis. A wide range of medical conditions and drugs can cause agitated delirium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70449 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Organic processes, such as meningitis and sepsis, should also be considered. The timing of onset of delirium may help differentiate toxin-induced causes from organic ones, as delirium from anticholinergic poisoning usually begins more abruptly than that from organic causes, such as sepsis or uremia.</p><p>Because so many classes of drugs and toxins have anticholinergic effects, clinicians must differentiate pure anticholinergic poisoning from poisonings in which anticholinergic toxicity is but one aspect. Tricyclic antidepressants can produce anticholinergic effects, but these generally occur soon after overdose, and effects from quinidine-like sodium channel blockade (resulting in a prolonged QRS interval) and alpha-blockade (resulting in hypotension) are usually more prominent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning&quot;</a>). Phenothiazines have modest anticholinergic effects, but their sedating and alpha-blocking properties tend to predominate.</p><p>Sympathomimetic overdose and serotonin toxicity may cause agitation, tachycardia, and hyperthermia, but can usually be differentiated from anticholinergic toxicity. Sympathomimetic overdose and serotonin toxicity generally cause diaphoresis, in contradistinction to anticholinergic overdose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In agitated, hyperthermic patients with altered mental status, salicylate overdose should also be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum drug levels of anticholinergic agents are neither helpful nor readily available in the clinical setting; the diagnosis of anticholinergic toxicity is based on clinical findings and occasionally the results of a <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnostic/therapeutic</span> trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antidotal therapy with physostigmine'</a> below.)</p><p>The following basic screening tests should be obtained in any patient with suspected overdose:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingerstick glucose, to rule out hypoglycemia as the cause of any alteration in mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels, to rule out these common coingestions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram (ECG), to rule out conduction system poisoning by coingestants that affect the QRS or the QTc intervals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy test in all women of childbearing age</p><p/><p>It is crucial that clinicians obtain an ECG in patients with anticholinergic toxicity. The ECG enables detection of prolonged QRS interval duration and arrhythmias from possible overdose of tricyclic antidepressants, certain phenothiazines (eg, mesoridazine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioridazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioridazine</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, and other agents. It also allows detection of QTc interval prolongation. Astemizole, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, was removed from the market in the United States because of QT prolongation and its association with Torsades de Pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Patients with severe psychomotor agitation and seizures should have a serum creatine kinase level checked to rule out rhabdomyolysis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxylamine</a>, an antihistamine found in an over-the-counter sleep aid, is unique in that it has been associated with nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p>Additional tests may be necessary depending on clinical circumstances (eg, cardiac enzymes for patients with chest pain; coagulation studies for suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation; assessment of renal function testing in patients with rhabdomyolysis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of the poisoned patient must always begin with stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Patients should have intravenous access, supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and continuous pulse oximetry. General discussions of the basic facets of the management of poisonings are found elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-elimination-of-poisons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced elimination of poisons&quot;</a>). A summary table to facilitate emergent management of anticholinergic overdose is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74091 \">table 1</a>).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> should be used in the treatment of prolonged QRS intervals or for arrhythmias related to anticholinergic poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The use of sodium bicarbonate, including dosing, in the treatment of poison-related cardiotoxicity is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Agitation and seizures should initially be treated with benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are effective, have a very high safety threshold, and can be used in high dose to control symptoms. Phenothiazines and butyrophenones should NOT be used to sedate patients with anticholinergic toxicity; they are themselves anticholinergic, and may exacerbate rather than improve symptoms.</p><p>Hyperthermia should be treated in typical fashion, including evaporative cooling for moderate to severe cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Decontamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although systemic anticholinergic toxicity has been reported from cutaneous and ocular absorption, most anticholinergic toxicity results from ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>Depending on the poison and the route and timing of exposure, gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination should be performed; in the vast majority of cases this consists only of administration of activated charcoal (AC). If the patient's mental status is intact and ingestion of an anticholinergic agent is likely, we suggest activated charcoal (AC) (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg;</span> maximum 50 g) be given. Charcoal should be withheld in patients with a depressed mental status who may not be able to protect their airway, unless tracheal intubation is performed first. However, tracheal intubation should not be performed for the sole purpose of giving AC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastric lavage is seldom needed, and induced emesis should be avoided. External decontamination may be necessary for topical agents (eg, removal of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> patch).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidotal therapy with physostigmine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with anticholinergic toxicity do well with supportive care alone, but some may benefit from antidotal therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. We believe that physostigmine is indicated when patients manifest <strong>both</strong> peripheral <strong>and</strong> moderate central anticholinergic toxicity (moderate to severe <span class=\"nowrap\">agitation/delirium)</span>. Physostigmine should <strong>not</strong> be given if a condition other than a purely anticholinergic poisoning is suspected (eg, tricyclic antidepressant overdose).</p><p>Clinicians should note that the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A major study designed to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug has yet to be performed. Caution should be used when giving physostigmine to patients with reactive airway disease, intestinal obstruction, epilepsy, and cardiac conduction abnormalities, as these are relative contraindications.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Physostigmine</a> is a carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that binds reversibly to inhibit acetylcholinesterase in both the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). Once physostigmine blocks acetylcholinesterase, the concentration of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors increases, and usually overcomes any anticholinergic blockade. Physostigmine is a tertiary amine and crosses the blood brain barrier; other medicinal carbamates (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>) are unable to traverse this barrier. Physostigmine is thus extremely useful in reversing the peripheral and central effects of anticholinergic toxicity.</p><p>Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is uncommonly used and unfamiliar to many clinicians, we recommend it be given after consultation with a medical toxicologist or regional poison center. In the United States, the nearest available poison control center can be reached by calling 1-800-222-1222. The World Health Organization provides a listing of international poison centers at its <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/&amp;token=SRGt6qYKWhTZXM65CFpL14d8PXUSsrQ0x2rLz73XxeUhuxfrbGVLKHyxP3WySgyuFIpDTJXXB5XK+p5bXcfQV68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=305\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>. The results of a small review suggest that EM physicians can administer physostigmine safely to patients with undifferentiated delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].&nbsp;</p><p>Before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is given, the patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and resuscitative equipment should be available at the bedside.</p><p>In adults, the recommended dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is 0.5 to 2 mg (0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, up to a maximum of 0.5 mg per dose in pediatric patients). The drug should be given by slow IV push generally over five minutes. Overly rapid administration may result in cholinergic symptoms or seizures.</p><p>The half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is approximately 15 minutes, but its effects often last significantly longer. Additional, smaller doses may be repeated after 20 to 30 minutes if agitated delirium recurs. Although patient symptoms and signs should guide the duration of physostigmine therapy, it is worth noting that in one retrospective study none of the 14 patient with anticholinergic toxicity required additional physostigmine more than 6.5 hours after the initial dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].&nbsp;</p><p>There are case reports of TCA-poisoned patients with a wide QRS interval (greater than 0.10 seconds) by ECG who developed asystole following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Although it is commonly taught that physostigmine should not be given in the setting of known or suspected tricyclic antidepressant overdose, some have questioned the basis for this proscription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. On a practical level, it is uncommon for patients with significant TCA poisoning to develop the agitated delirium suggestive of severe central anticholinergic toxicity. While TCAs are weak anticholinergics, they are strong antihistamines, and TCA-poisoned patients are usually sedated, not delirious. Physostigmine would therefore not be considered in these patients based on their mental status. As a general rule, we do <strong>NOT</strong> use physostigmine when TCA poisoning is known or suspected, or when the duration of the QRS interval is at or above 100 msec.</p><p>If the patient is not poisoned with an anticholinergic substance, or if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is given injudiciously, cholinergic toxicity may result. Symptoms of cholinergic excess include: diarrhea, urination, miosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">bronchospasm/bronchorrhea,</span> emesis, lacrimation, and sweating (the mnemonic often used is DUMBELS). Seizures and bradyarrhythmias may also ensue. In patients who develop cholinergic toxicity, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> may be administered. A reasonable starting dose of atropine is half the dose of the physostigmine that was administered, titrated to clinical effect. The clinical findings of cholinergic toxicity are described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;, section on 'Acute toxicity'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Physostigmine</a> appears to be superior to benzodiazepines in the management of agitation and delirium due to anticholinergic toxicity. In a retrospective study of 52 consecutive patients treated for anticholinergic poisoning, physostigmine was significantly more effective than benzodiazepines in controlling agitation and delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients treated with physostigmine experienced fewer complications and had shorter recovery times. Although patients with very minor anticholinergic toxicity may respond well to small doses of benzodiazepines, those with moderate to severe agitation will likely respond better to physostigmine.</p><p>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> may clarify the diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning. In the absence of a clear history of anticholinergic ingestion, patients who present with fever, agitation, and delirium usually require diagnostic testing (eg, computerized tomography of the head and lumbar puncture). In such patients, if physostigmine leads to dramatic clinical improvement, further workup is often unnecessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unintentional ingestions are the leading cause of anticholinergic poisoning among children. The clinical presentation and management are similar to that in adults. Management consists of close observation, supportive care, activated charcoal (AC) administration, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a>, if indicated. The pediatric dose of physostigmine is 0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum 0.5 mg).</p><p>Adolescents may ingest a variety of substances for their hallucinogenic properties or with suicidal intent, including drugs with anticholinergic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Plants such as jimson weed are easily found in the environment and a popular item for consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anticholinergic-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Asymptomatic patients who have ingested an anticholinergic substance should receive gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) and be observed in the emergency department for a minimum of six hours. If they remain asymptomatic during this observation period, they may be discharged.</p><p>Patients with mild anticholinergic toxicity should receive gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination with AC (if possible), and may be treated with benzodiazepines (if necessary) and observed for resolution of symptoms. If symptoms resolve within a reasonable time frame (six hours) they may be discharged; if not, they should be admitted for observation, including pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring.</p><p>Patients who have severe anticholinergic toxicity, and patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a>, should be admitted to an intensive care unit for observation.</p><p>Certain anticholinergic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a>) can have effects for 24 to 48 hours following exposure. In rare instances effects have lasted up to two weeks. Such patients require a longer period of observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13151981\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses. The World Health Organization provides a listing of international poison centers at its <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/&amp;token=SRGt6qYKWhTZXM65CFpL14d8PXUSsrQ0x2rLz73XxeUhuxfrbGVLKHyxP3WySgyuFIpDTJXXB5XK+p5bXcfQV68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=305\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2142072264\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Examples of classes of medications with anticholinergic properties include: antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>), tricyclic antidepressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>), sleep aids, cold preparations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a>, and tainted illicit street drugs. Anticholinergic overdose is common, and occurs most often through oral ingestion. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anticholinergic poisons'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic description of anticholinergic intoxication is well known:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Red as a beet&quot; (cutaneous vasodilation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Dry as a bone&quot; (anhidrosis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Hot as a hare&quot; (anhydrotic hyperthermia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Blind as a bat&quot; (nonreactive mydriasis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Mad as a hatter&quot; (delirium; hallucinations)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Full as a flask&quot; (urinary retention)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Other clinical features not included in the mnemonic include tachycardia, which is the earliest and most reliable sign of anticholinergic toxicity, and decreased or absent bowel sounds. Although central and peripheral anticholinergic effects are commonly seen together, in some cases, central effects may persist after resolution of peripheral symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of overdose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any substance or condition that produces an alteration in mental status, tachycardia, urinary retention, or seizure should be included in the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70449 \">table 4</a>). Organic processes, such as meningitis and sepsis, should also be considered. The timing of onset of delirium may help differentiate toxin-induced causes from organic ones, as delirium from anticholinergic poisoning usually begins more abruptly than that from organic causes, such as sepsis or uremia.

Benzodiazepines are effective, have a very high safety threshold, and can be used in high dose to control symptoms. We suggest phenothiazines and butyrophenones <strong>NOT</strong> be used to sedate patients with anticholinergic toxicity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); they are themselves anticholinergic, and may exacerbate rather than improve symptoms. Hyperthermia should be treated in standard fashion. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient's mental status is intact and ingestion of an anticholinergic agent is likely, we suggest decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg;</span> maximum 50 g) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Charcoal should be withheld in patients who are sedated and may not be able to protect their airway, unless tracheal intubation is performed first. Tracheal intubation should not be performed solely for the purpose of giving charcoal. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is controversial, we suggest this antidote be given to patients manifesting <strong>both</strong> peripheral <strong>and</strong> moderate central (moderate to severe <span class=\"nowrap\">agitation/delirium)</span> anticholinergic toxicity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We believe consultation with a medical toxicologist or regional poison center should be obtained before physostigmine is given. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antidotal therapy with physostigmine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a> is administered, the patient should be placed on a cardiac monitor, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and resuscitative equipment should be available at the bedside. In adults, the recommended dose of physostigmine is 0.5 to 2 mg (0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, up to a maximum of 0.5 mg per dose in pediatric patients). The drug should be given by <strong>slow</strong> IV push. Caution should be used when giving physostigmine to patients with reactive airway disease, intestinal obstruction, epilepsy, and cardiac conduction abnormalities, as these are relative contraindications. The benefits and risks of physostigmine are discussed in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antidotal therapy with physostigmine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients should be observed in the emergency department for a minimum of six hours.

Patients who have severe anticholinergic toxicity, and patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">physostigmine</a>, should be admitted to an intensive care unit for observation.
