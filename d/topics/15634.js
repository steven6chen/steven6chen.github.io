In addition, patients are more likely to develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonic features and have a history of severe or recurrent episodes. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

The presence of these somatic symptoms should be evaluated in the context of normal expectations for the postpartum period. As an example, postpartum patients frequently lack energy due to sleep deprivation and caring for an infant. However, lack of energy to the point that patients need to make a significant effort to initiate or maintain usual daily activities can be a mild to moderate depressive symptom, and anergia to the point that patients cannot get out of bed for hours is probably a symptom of severe depression. Persistent uncertainty as to whether an episode of major depression is mild to moderate or severe can be resolved by referral to a psychiatrist (preferably one specializing in perinatal disorders). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1024294822\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles and issues that are involved in treating postpartum unipolar major depression include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting (eg, outpatient or inpatient)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating patients and families</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribing antidepressants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing nonresponse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making referrals</p><p/><p>These general principles are discussed in detail separately.

Patients initially receive initial therapy and progress through each step until they respond. The primary treatments are antidepressant medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, psychotherapy is nearly always indicated as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy, unless symptoms render the patient incapable of participating. </p><p>The duration of an adequate trial with antidepressant medications is discussed separately.

One review estimated that among all women who deliver, breastfeeding is initiated by approximately 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23539406\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe, postpartum unipolar major depression who are breastfeeding, we suggest antidepressant medications, based upon their efficacy in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Antidepressants are more available than psychotherapy, and using antidepressants is consistent with multiple practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/6,7,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10-13</a>].

Most patients prefer combination therapy; a study of women with perinatal unipolar major depression (n = 100, including 73 postpartum patients) found that pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy was preferred by 55 percent, whereas medication monotherapy was preferred by only 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Indirect evidence supporting the use of add-on psychotherapy includes numerous, relatively large randomized trials that excluded breastfeeding patients; these trials found that combination therapy is more efficacious than pharmacotherapy alone. Although several randomized trials in patients with postnatal depression have failed to show that combination therapy is superior to monotherapy, each study was small and underpowered, and many of the patients had mild to moderate episodes of major depression, rather than severe depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].

The evidence regarding the use of antidepressants during breastfeeding does not clearly demonstrate that one drug is safer than another. In addition, exposure to antidepressants that has already occurred in utero is substantially greater than exposure through breast milk.</p><p>For patients with severe major depression who are breastfeeding and have not been treated with antidepressants in the past, we suggest SSRIs because of their efficacy and tolerability for postpartum depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/9,14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,24</a>].

Patients with mild to moderate illness generally do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning, are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgement that places the patient and others at risk for imminent harm. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization. (See <a href=\"#H5610838\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general principles and issues involved in treating postpartum unipolar major depression include setting (eg, outpatient or inpatient), history of prior treatment, educating patients and families, adherence, monitoring symptoms, prescribing antidepressants, managing nonresponse, and making referrals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-general-principles-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum unipolar major depression: General principles of treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe, postpartum unipolar major depression who are breastfeeding, we suggest antidepressant medications rather than other treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). There is a general consensus that the benefits of antidepressants outweigh the potential risks to the infant. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy typically receive psychotherapy as an adjuvant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, psychotherapy alone is a reasonable alternative in patients with a prior history of poor response to multiple antidepressants, or if patients decline pharmacotherapy after weighing the risks. Using psychotherapy alone is appropriate provided that the depressive syndrome does not include suicidal ideation or obvious impairment of function. (See <a href=\"#H23539406\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1181242621\" class=\"local\">'Weighing the risks'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For postpartum patients treated with antidepressants during pregnancy, it is preferable to use the same medication while breastfeeding, even if there are better lactation safety data for other drugs, because switching increases the risk of relapse and number of drug exposures. The evidence regarding the use of antidepressants during breastfeeding does not clearly demonstrate that one drug is safer than another. In addition, exposure to antidepressants that has already occurred in utero is substantially greater than exposure through breast milk.
