A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the growing wrist, common wrist injuries, and other causes of wrist pain are essential to accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.</p><p>An overview of the relevant anatomy, epidemiology, and evaluation of wrist injuries in children and adolescents will be presented below. Causes of wrist pain and injury are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute wrist injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic wrist pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wrist and hand are described in the anatomic position with the fifth digits medial and the palm facing anterior. &quot;Lateral&quot; and &quot;radial&quot; describe the thumb side; &quot;medial&quot; and &quot;ulnar&quot; describe the little finger side. The anterior aspect is &quot;palmar&quot; or &quot;volar&quot; and the posterior aspect is &quot;dorsal.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bones</strong> &ndash; The wrist is formed by articulations between the radius, ulna, and the carpal bones. There are eight carpal bones distributed in proximal and distal rows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78359 \">figure 1</a>). The scaphoid (ie, navicular) bone provides a stabilizing link between the proximal and distal carpal bones. During development, the carpal ossification centers and the growth plates of the distal radius and ulna appear and fuse in a predictable stepwise fashion that is used to determine skeletal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60678\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60678 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Joints</strong> &ndash; The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is a small, J-shaped, fluid-filled joint where the ulnar head articulates with the ulnar notch in the distal radius (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53465 \">figure 2</a>). It serves as the main point for supination and pronation of the forearm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The articulation between the distal radius and the scaphoid and lunate bones forms the radiocarpal joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53465 \">figure 2</a>). The radiocarpal joint and the midcarpal joint, which is between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones, are responsible for the majority of wrist flexion and extension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is no direct bony articulation between the distal ulna and the carpal bones; the ulnar side of the wrist is supported by the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), interposed between the distal ulna and triquetrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63443 \">figure 3</a>). The TFCC is the major stabilizer of the DRUJ; it includes the triangular fibrocartilage, ulnar collateral ligament, dorsal and palmar radioulnar ligaments, ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral ligaments, and the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ligaments and capsule</strong> &ndash; The wrist is supported by a thin joint capsule, a thick complex of crisscrossing ligaments, and the fascia covering the flexor and extensor tendons (the retinaculum). The ligaments of the wrist are divided into two main categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic ligaments bind the carpal bones together; extrinsic ligaments bind the distal radius and ulna to the carpal bones, providing stability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The palmar radiocarpal, scapholunate, and lunotriquetral ligaments are the most clinically important (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63301 \">figure 4</a>). The palmar radiocarpal ligaments ensure that the carpal bones move with the radius during supination and pronation. Disruption of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments can lead to chronic pain and instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscles and tendons</strong> &ndash; The muscles of the wrist are divided into two major groups: palmar and dorsal. The palmar group includes the wrist and finger flexors and the forearm pronators. They are innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. The dorsal group includes the wrist and finger extensors and thumb extensors and abductors. They are innervated by the radial nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The tendon sheaths of the fifth flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus share a common sheath in the carpal tunnel that extends just distal to the wrist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53265 \">figure 5</a>). Thus, infections from the sheath of the 5th digit can extend to the wrist via direct communication with the common flexor sheath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vessels</strong> &ndash; The ulnar and radial arteries, branches of the brachial artery, are the main arteries of the forearm. At the level of the wrist, each of these arteries contributes branches to form the superficial and deep palmar arches that supply the hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerves</strong> &ndash; The wrist is innervated by the median, ulnar, and radial nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F53902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53902 \">table 2</a>). The median nerve traverses the carpal tunnel, an elliptically shaped canal enclosed by the inelastic flexor retinaculum ventrally and the carpal bones dorsally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59856 \">figure 6</a>). In addition to the median nerve, eight deep and superficial flexor tendons and their sheaths, the flexor pollicis longus tendon and sheath, and occasionally the radial and ulnar palmar bursae or the median artery pass through the carpal tunnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53265 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The ulnar nerve traverses Guyon's canal, which is bordered by the palmar carpal ligament, the transverse retinacular ligament, the pisiform, and the hook of the hamate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biomechanics</strong> &ndash; The four principal movements of the wrist are flexion, extension, pronation, and supination; the wrist can also be deviated ulnarly and radially.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wrist flexion and extension are initiated at the base of the metacarpals where the flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris (the major wrist flexors) and the extensor carpi radialis and ulnaris (the major wrist extensors) insert. Seventy to 90 degrees of flexion occurs at the wrist. The radiocarpal joint accounts for approximately 60 percent of the motion and the midcarpal joint for approximately 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The radioulnar joint is responsible for pronation and supination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The wrist has about 30 to 40 degrees of ulnar and 15 to 30 degrees of radial deviation. Much of this motion is due to translation of the proximal and distal carpal row on the radius, which slide in opposite direction of movement (ie, radial wrist deviation has carpal ulnar deviation).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanisms of wrist injury can be divided into four major categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]:</p><p>(1) Impact</p><p>(2) Weightbearing</p><p>(3) Twisting</p><p>(4) Throwing or repetitive motion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impact</strong> &ndash; Fall onto the wrist (the most common mechanism of acute injury) or direct impact from contact with a fellow player, ball, or other object (eg, puck, racquet).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Impact injuries include fractures (distal forearm, scaphoid, triquetral, hook of hamate), Kienb&ouml;ck's disease, and injuries to the ligaments and capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Repetitive impact can lead to overuse injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-wrist-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute wrist injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-wrist-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic wrist pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Overuse injuries'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most falls occur with the wrist in an extended and pronated position. If the wrist was radially deviated at the time of the fall, scaphoid injuries are more likely; if the wrist was ulnarly deviated, ulnar styloid and TFCC injuries should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weightbearing</strong> &ndash; Weightbearing injuries occur most frequently in gymnasts, wrestlers, weight lifters, and rock-climbers. Weightbearing injuries include dorsal wrist impaction syndrome, distal radius physis stress syndrome, DRUJ dislocation, TFCC injury, ganglion cyst, carpal tunnel syndrome, and intersection syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wrist-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Twisting injuries affect joint stability, typically at the DRUJ.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Throwing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other repetitive motion</strong> &ndash; Throwing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other repetitive motion is common among players of racquet, stick, and club sports; weight lifters; rowers; and gymnasts. Repetitive motions can lead to overuse injuries including tendonitis, distal physeal stress reaction, and neuropathy.
