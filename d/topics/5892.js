(&quot;Older person&quot; in this case means anyone older than 60 or 65.)</p><p>Elder abuse can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical abuse, such as hitting, kicking, or pushing the older person</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual abuse, such as raping or forcing the older person to remove clothing or do any sex act</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychological abuse, such as insulting or threatening the older person</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Illegal or inappropriate use of the older person's money or property</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abandonment, meaning the older person is left alone without care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neglect, meaning that the older person does not get the care he or she needs</p><p/><p>Neglect might be the most complicated item on this list, because it can involve self-neglect. Self-neglect is when the older person does not care for himself or herself properly. Neglect, in general, can mean that the older person:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not get all the food and water he or she needs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not get the medicines he or she needs, or gets them at the wrong times or in the wrong doses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not get bathed or dressed properly, or is left with dirty clothes or untreated sores or wounds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is forced to live in dirty conditions or in a home that is too hot or too cold</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94547909\"><span class=\"h1\">Who is at risk for elder abuse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elder abuse is most common among older people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are women</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older than 80</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need help caring for themselves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble thinking clearly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are depressed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had a broken hip at some point</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had a stroke at some point</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not have a lot of social connections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are poor or have trouble paying bills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have family members who are ill or who recently died, or whose family has stress for other reasons</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are being cared for by family members who:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have problems with drugs or alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Are depressed, violent, or antisocial (which means they do not relate well to other people)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rely on the older person for money or financial support</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94547916\"><span class=\"h1\">How can you tell if an older person is being abused?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older people who are being abused can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuts, scrapes, bruises, burns, or broken bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss or obvious lack of food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydration, meaning the older person is not getting enough water or fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, soreness, bruising, or bleeding in the anal or genital area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections that are spread through sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Pressure sores&quot; that form on the skin when a person sits or lies in one position for too long</p><p/><p>Some of these signs can occur in older people who are not being abused, but they are more likely to happen in people who are not being cared for the right way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94547923\"><span class=\"h1\">Who usually does the abusing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 9 out of 10 cases, the abuser is a family member&mdash;usually the older person&rsquo;s husband, wife, or adult child. In some cases, the abuser is someone who cares for the older person in a hospital, nursing home, or other setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94547930\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to prevent or stop the abuse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have a loved one who is older, the most important thing to do is to keep in touch with him or her. If you suspect any problems with abuse or neglect, ask him or her about it, or bring it up with his or her doctor.</p><p>You can also call Adult Protective Services in your state. To find the phone number for Adult Protective Services, call directory assistance (4-1-1) and ask for the Department of Social Services or Aging Services. </p><p>You can also check online at <a href=\"http://www.eldercare.gov/&amp;token=ZCxI8fUANIwd4qAsLL5OEFKmKN1odLsNvHoXaWo5TmubwYEGnwft9rFSWWnqlU44&amp;TOPIC_ID=4901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.eldercare.gov</a> and search by &quot;elder abuse.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94548012\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tips-for-caregivers-of-people-with-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tips for caregivers of people with Alzheimer disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-memory-and-thinking-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Evaluating memory and thinking problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mild cognitive impairment (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
