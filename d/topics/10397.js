EH frequently results from chronic estrogen stimulation unopposed by the counterbalancing effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Obese women and women with chronic ovulatory dysfunction (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome) are at high risk for EH, as well as women at increased genetic risk of endometrial cancer (Lynch syndrome).

Historically, the most common treatments were oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (MPA) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>, but the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, 52 mg with a release rate of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> over five years (Mirena; <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5),</span> is now first-line therapy. </p><p>General data regarding different progestin preparations are presented here. Information specific to each diagnostic category of EH is reviewed in the sections below. </p><p>The <strong><span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</strong></span> has been found in randomized trials to be more effective than oral progestins. In addition to higher efficacy, the other advantages of the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> are that it offers long-acting contraception and does not require daily dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. It is typically better tolerated than oral progestins, although the meta-analysis of randomized trials cited above found no significant difference in rates of irregular vaginal bleeding with the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> compared with oral progestins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> starts with an initial dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day;</span> by five years the daily dose is approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span>. As with other progestin-only medications, the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> initially results in irregular bleeding, but eventually most women using the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> become amenorrheic or have light tolerable bleeding. </p><p>Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices are also available in lower daily doses (13.5, 17.5, and 18.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day)</span> and vary from three- to five-year formulations, but these have not been studied in women with EH to determine whether the lower progestin dose is as effective as the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span>. We do not use them for this indication in our practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.) </p><p><strong>Oral progestin </strong>preparations can effectively treat the majority of cases of EH without atypia and some milder forms of atypical EH. </p><p>Oral progestins may be preferred by women with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who decline or cannot tolerate an intrauterine device due to side effects (eg, dysmenorrhea).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with uterine factors that make placement or retention of an intrauterine device difficult (eg, severe distortion of the uterine cavity due to fibroids, a congenital anomaly, or recurrent expulsion of the intrauterine device).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who plan to try to conceive a pregnancy as soon as a therapeutic response is achieved, since progestins are contraindicated in pregnancy and the patient can stop an oral medication without requiring a clinician to remove the device, as with an intrauterine device.</p><p/><p>Oral progestins may be given as progestins alone (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>, MPA) or as estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives (OCs). </p><p>In oral progestin regimens, women are usually treated for three to six months with continuous dosing.

Although there is practice variation based on shared decision-making with patients, megestrol is often our first choice of an oral progestin to treat atypical EH because it is a strong progestin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MPA 10 to 20 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, a randomized study of NETA (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> compared with depot MPA (DMPA) showed that DMPA results in a higher rate of regression of nonatypical EH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> 200 to 300 mg daily was beneficial in a single study of women with EH without atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However this is a relatively weak progestin, and we do not consider it for first-line progestin treatment for EH. In our practice, we use it only for EH in women who are at low risk for progression and who cannot tolerate stronger synthetic progestins or refuse the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span>.</p><p/><p>There are no studies on the use of vaginal micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> for the treatment of EH. A small study of infertility patients found that vaginal micronized progesterone had similar effects on the endometrium as intramuscular progesterone, with no EH seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In theory, this progestin could be used as maintenance treatment, as its local effect achieves high endometrial concentrations.</p><p>In terms of dosing regimen for treating EH, continuous (daily dosing) progestins or progestin intrauterine devices are superior to cyclic progestin regimens (dosing varies, medication is typically taken for at least 12 to 14 days and then the patient receives no medication for the remainder of the month) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. As an example of data supporting this, in a small prospective study of 170 women, the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> was the most effective therapy; cyclic therapy was found to be inferior to both <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> and continuous oral progestins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Continuous dosing schedules are not only more effective, but they may be better tolerated than a cyclic regimen if amenorrhea can be achieved. Irregular vaginal bleeding can be bothersome at the inception of continuous regimens and may ultimately lead to changing to <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span> if bleeding cannot be controlled. </p><p><strong>Progestin injections and implants</strong> have not been well studied for the treatment of EH. We do not use implants in our practice. However, one of the authors uses DMPA. </p><p>DMPA is a long-acting progestin, provides contraception, and requires only four injections per year. Thus, one of the authors uses DMPA as second-line therapy for women who are intolerant of oral progestins or the <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5</span>.</p><p>One study found that the intramuscular DMPA (150 mg every three months) was more successful than NETA (15 mg daily for 14 days per cycle) in the treatment of nonatypical EH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In this six-month randomized trial (n = 146) of women ages 35 to 50 years with simple or complex EH without atypia, rates of regression to normal endometrium among the subset of women with complex EH without atypia were higher with DMPA compared with NETA (91 versus 66 percent). Side effects were present with both medications, with more nausea and breast discomfort with NETA and more amenorrhea with DMPA.</p><p><strong>Combined <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> contraceptives (pills, patches, rings) </strong>have not been studied for treatment of EH.

In the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) terminology system, the diagnostic categories are EH with atypia and EH without atypia. On the 1994 WHO system, EH without atypia and EH with atypia each have two subcategories: simple and complex; however, simplex EH with atypia is a rare entity. In the Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia (EIN) classification system, the categories are benign EH (BEH) and EIN. EIN is nearly synonymous with EH with atypia; however, the definition of EIN includes the presence of glandular crowding, even without atypia. Thus, the WHO category of EH without atypia has some overlap with both BEH and EIN. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia#H1994367756\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;, section on 'Classification systems'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The 2015 WHO system is preferred by most institutions, but not all pathologists have incorporated the 2015 WHO classification system into their assessment and reporting of endometrial specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Given that this may result in heterogenous results depending on the system used, both the 2015 and 1994 WHO classification systems are used below to refer to diagnostic categories and management recommendations.

However, proliferative patterns observed in anovulatory premenopausal women or in postmenopausal women, if not corrected, signify an excess of estrogen that may place women at higher risk of developing EH. </p><p>As an example, on a series of 219 perimenopausal females with abnormal uterine bleeding, 30.5 percent had proliferative endometrium noted on endometrial sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a similar study of 119 perimenopausal and menopausal patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, proliferative endometrium was the most common pattern seen in perimenopausal women (35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Treatment of proliferative endometrium should be solely based on the nature of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms that prompted the biopsy and the effect of such symptoms on quality of life. In our practice, we favor the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device for premenopausal patients. For postmenopausal patients, consideration can be given to either the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device or oral progestins.

Hysterectomy is the treatment of choice for most women with atypical EH. Progestin therapy is a reasonable option for women who wish to preserve fertility or who cannot tolerate surgery. </p><p>Historically, the recommendation of hysterectomy for atypical EH was even stronger, and few exceptions were made. This was based upon the high risk of concurrent endometrial carcinoma or progression to endometrial carcinoma and the limited data regarding efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. Since that time, progestin therapy with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, 52 mg with a release rate of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> over five years (Mirena; <span class=\"nowrap\">LNg52/5),</span> has been introduced and studies of this progestin option show regression of atypical EH and grade 1 endometrial carcinoma in up to 75 to 85 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

During hysterectomy, gross inspection and frozen section should be performed to evaluate for endometrial carcinoma.</p><p>For women undergoing hysterectomy as treatment for atypical EH, we suggest hysterectomy <strong>without bilateral oophorectomy</strong> rather than with bilateral oophorectomy.

Professional societies have not issued guidelines regarding oophorectomy in women with atypical EH.</p><p>The disadvantages of performing oophorectomy in all women at time of hysterectomy for atypical EH is that this practice exposes patients to potential additional perioperative morbidity or negative long-term health effects. Increased surgical risk is usually minimal with the addition of oophorectomy, but there are studies of adverse long-term health effects associated with elective oophorectomy. Premenopausal women who undergo oophorectomy will have adverse effects of premature or early menopause, but other long-term adverse effects (eg, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline) have also been reported in postmenopausal women.

All measures should be taken to detect endometrial carcinoma before or during hysterectomy (ie, dilation and curettage, intraoperative gross examination, and frozen section). However, these measures may fail to detect malignancy. Reports of the sensitivity of frozen section to detect endometrial carcinoma mostly range from to 73 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>], although one study reported a sensitivity of 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>Even in cases of endometrial carcinoma, the ovaries have metastatic disease in only 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Also, women with concurrent atypical EH and endometrial carcinoma are likely to have low-risk disease, and the likelihood of an impact on survival with retaining the ovaries in a woman with stage I, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].
