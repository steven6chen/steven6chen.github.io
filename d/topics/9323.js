It is almost exclusively caused by trauma. The morbidity and mortality result from mass effect on the brain as the hematoma expands and strips the dura away from the skull. EDH in children requires special knowledge of location and clinical presentation. Prompt diagnosis and neurosurgical consultation is critical to the successful management of EDH.</p><p>This topic discusses the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of EDH in children. Epidemiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology of EDH in children as well as EDH in adults are presented separately.

Of note, even relatively minor mechanisms of head injury in young infants can cause serious traumatic brain injury, including EDH. The evaluation of minor head trauma in such patients is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H1237796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Younger than two years'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP)</strong> &ndash; Symptoms of increased ICP including headache, vomiting, seizure, confusion, lethargy, or loss of consciousness are associated with EDH and other intracranial injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Classic presentation</strong> &ndash; Although less commonly seen in children, the classically described presentation of EDH consists of initial loss of consciousness. Next, the patient has a lucid interval for a period of time that ranges from minutes to hours but is typically four to six hours. This lucid interval is followed by an abrupt onset of coma. (See <a href=\"#H982689193\" class=\"local\">'Temporal skull injury with a lucid interval'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Head trauma in a child with a bleeding disorder</strong> &ndash; Children with a preexisting bleeding disorder (eg, hemophilia) may be at an increased risk of EDH after moderate to severe head trauma. Observational studies suggest that the frequency of serious traumatic brain injury, including EDH may <strong>not</strong> be more common after minor head trauma in children with bleeding disorders when compared to normal children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H3332938\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Patients with shunts or bleeding disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atraumatic epidural hematoma in patients with sickle cell disease</strong> &ndash; Although rare, epidural hematomas can occur without known head trauma in patients with sickle cell disease. Affected patients may present with pain crisis, headache, evidence of skull infarction, scalp edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> periorbital edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H982689249\"><span class=\"h2\">Findings by age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical findings vary by age. However, any altered mental status associated with head injury in a child should raise suspicion for an epidural hematoma. This heightens the significance of a parental complaint that their infant or child is &quot;not acting right&quot;. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates and infants younger than 12 months of age pose a significant challenge to diagnosis of an EDH because the open fontanelles in these patients permit expansion of the skull volume with accumulation of the EDH. Thus, initial findings are nonspecific. Furthermore, EDH may occur in infants younger than three months of age, even with relatively minor mechanisms of injury.</p><p>A scalp hematoma, especially large or in the temporal or occipital region, provides an important marker of underlying traumatic brain injury, including EDH, in asymptomatic infants younger than 12 months of age.

Thus, bradycardia, pupillary changes, and hemiparesis are <strong>late</strong> findings often associated with rapid neurologic deterioration and poor outcomes despite rapid intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Older children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In older children, an EDH should be suspected if there is a witnessed deterioration in neurologic status at any time after a head injury. Depending upon the severity of traumatic injury, children may present with varying degrees of impaired consciousness and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 2</a>). Clinical findings also depend upon the size and location of the hematoma as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild to moderate signs and symptoms</strong> - Patients are often neurologically intact. In these children, common symptoms include headache, vomiting, or irritability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe signs and symptoms</strong> &ndash; Children with large hematomas often are comatose (GCS &le;8 or rapidly changing level of consciousness). These patients warrant urgent surgical evacuation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lateralizing neurologic signs (eg, anisocoria, hemiparesis, hemiplegia) arising from compression of the third cranial nerve and brainstem may also be present. These findings are indicators of progression to cerebral uncal herniation. The side of the dilated pupil matches the side of the hematoma in roughly 90 percent of cases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The constellation of systemic hypertension, bradycardia, and respiratory disturbance (Cushing triad) is another late sign associated with cerebral herniation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H982689193\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal skull injury with a lucid interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic presentation of an EDH after a direct blow to the temporal region is characterized by a lucid interval, where a child initially may have a decreased level of consciousness due to the primary brain injury, then returns to normal level of consciousness for several hours (typically four to six hours although longer lucid periods can be observed). After this, as the blood accumulates in the epidural space and compresses the brain, the child rapidly deteriorates. However, this type of history is variably present in children (37 to 67 percent of patients) and often absent in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6,9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-14</a>]. The clinician's goal is to make the diagnosis of EDH <strong>before</strong> neurologic deterioration in an asymptomatic or mildly affected child to permit timely surgical intervention, if needed. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Definitive management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H904132330\"><span class=\"h2\">Occipital injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EDH in the posterior fossa deserves separate discussion because of a significant potential for sudden clinical decompensation with few warning signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82581\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82581 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75448\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75448 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>EDH is located in the posterior fossa in 3 to 17 percent of pediatric cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4,7,9,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,9,10,13</a>]. Falls onto the occipital region of the head account for most of these injuries. Occipital bone fractures are present in 78 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. These fractures often cross a dural sinus, resulting in venous hemorrhage and delayed symptoms.</p><p>Children commonly present with an initial loss of consciousness, headache, and vomiting. Less commonly, there may be dizziness, stiff neck, or pyramidal or cerebellar signs (eg, dysmetria, ataxia, Romberg sign, or ulnar drift). Children may have a subacute onset of symptoms up to a few days after minor occipital trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,16</a>].</p><p>Despite a relatively benign presentation, these children can deteriorate rapidly with lethal outcomes caused by compression of the brainstem or by hydrocephalus secondary to fourth ventricular obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The limited spatial capacity of the posterior fossa and its vital contents provide the substrate for such grave consequences when an EDH causes mass effect in this region.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H982689099\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging of the head is essential to rapidly make the diagnosis of epidural hematoma (EDH). (See <a href=\"#H821819495\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.) In most centers, computed tomography is the study of choice, but rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also accurately detect the blood clot, although is less likely to demonstrate a fracture.</p><p>Other studies (eg, cervical spine imaging and laboratory testing) are necessary as adjuncts for management of associated trauma or in preparation for operative management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H904131453\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usefulness and need for initial laboratory studies varies according to the severity of the head trauma and whether additional injuries are suspected. </p><p>To assess for anemia or coagulopathy and to prepare for potential surgery, blood studies are warranted in patients with severe head trauma as indicated by altered mental status, focal neurologic examination, or other physical findings of increased intracranial hypertension (eg, vomiting or headache) as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with platelets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prothrombin time (PT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>International normalized ratio (INR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type and cross</p><p/><p>Other studies (eg, AST, ALT, and urinalysis) are also typically obtained in patients with multiple trauma, depending upon specific findings.

Typically, MRI is an adjunct to CT in the evaluation of acute head trauma and is used for situations in which there is a strong suspicion for EDH or subdural hematoma, but no clear evidence of hematoma by CT. In some institutions, &ldquo;rapid MRI&rdquo; using a rapid T2 sequence is replacing CT in selected patients to avoid the exposure to radiation associated with a CT.

The crucial factor seems to be minimizing the time between the onset of impaired consciousness and the evacuation of the hematoma. Good neurologic recovery after evacuation is associated with a high GCS at presentation and a pure epidural hematoma without associated lesions.
