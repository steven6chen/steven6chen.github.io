BPH can lead to urinary symptoms of increased frequency of urination, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency, and weak urinary stream. Symptomatic patients may benefit from medical or surgical treatment.</p><p>The medical therapy of BPH will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis, epidemiology and pathogenesis, and surgical and other invasive therapies of BPH are all discussed separately.

These patients may be monitored and advised regarding behavioral modification.</p><p>Behavioral modification may be helpful for all patients. For example, patients may benefit from voiding in the sitting position (rather than standing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

BPH can lead to urinary symptoms that may benefit from medical or surgical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that all men with symptoms of BPH be instructed in behavioral interventions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). These should be tailored to symptoms but may include avoiding fluids prior to bedtime or before going out, reducing consumption of mild diuretics such as caffeine and alcohol, and double voiding to empty the bladder more completely. They should also avoid medications that can exacerbate symptoms (eg, diuretics) or induce urinary retention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75763 \">table 1</a>).

The choice of specific alpha-adrenergic antagonist agent is generally based on cost and side effect profile.
