Most patients who are ultimately diagnosed with myocardial infarction have some new abnormality seen on one or more serial ECGs performed around the time of the clinical event. This issue is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Contiguous leads are defined as pairs or groups of leads that reflect the different walls of the heart. These are the inferior (II, III, aVF), lateral (I, aVL), and anterior leads (V1 to V6).</p><p/><p>The findings on the ECG depend upon several characteristics of the ischemia or infarction including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration &ndash; Hyperacute, acute, evolving, or chronic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size &ndash; Amount of myocardium affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location &ndash; Anterior versus inferior-posterior or right ventricle</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99427611\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNIFICANCE OF Q WAVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Q waves are not required for the electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H99426212\" class=\"local\">'ECG criteria for myocardial ischemia/infarct'</a> above.) When present, they may suggest the portion of the left and right ventricles that have been affected and the size of the infarct. Loss of electromotive forces due to infarcted myocardial tissue leads to R wave loss. Delayed conduction through an ischemic area or conduction around it results in recording potentials from the opposite ventricular wall, which manifest as Q wave formation in the relevant leads.</p><p>The reason why Q waves do or do not develop following coronary occlusion is related, ultimately, to the size and location of the infarct. Careful ECG-pathologic correlations have shown that transmural infarcts can occur without Q waves and that subendocardial infarcts can be associated with Q waves. Therefore, it is best to describe infarcts electrocardiographically as Q wave or non-Q wave, rather than by the terms &quot;transmural&quot; or &quot;subendocardial&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is in contrast to the clinical diagnosis of MI that is described as ST elevation MI or non-ST elevation MI. In a study using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, the presence or absence of Q waves was more closely correlated with the size of the MI than with its transmural extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-q-waves-on-the-electrocardiogram\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of Q waves on the electrocardiogram&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ECG findings related to Q waves may be somewhat different with posterior or lateral MI. Loss of depolarization forces in these regions can reciprocally <strong>increase</strong> R wave amplitude in leads V1 and V2 without causing diagnostic Q waves in any of the conventional leads. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Posterior wall MI'</a> below.)</p><p>According to the 2012 Joint European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/World</span> Health Task Force, the following are the criteria for ECG changes associated with <strong>prior </strong>MI (in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy or left bundle branch block) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any Q wave in leads V2 to V3 &ge;0.02 sec or QS complex in V2 and V3; or Q wave &ge;0.03 sec and &ge;0.1 mV deep or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL, aVF; or V4 to V6 in any two leads of a contiguous lead grouping (I, aVL; V1 to V6; II, III, aVF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>R wave &ge;0.04 sec in V1 to V2 and <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S</span> &ge;1 with a concordant positive T wave in the absence of a conduction defect.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCATION OF ISCHEMIA OR INFARCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The portion of the left ventricle that is ischemic or infarcted may be predicted by which electrocardiogram (ECG) leads show ST-segment, T wave, or Q wave abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Clinicians may be able to use this information to adjust the management approach and help forecast potential complications. For instance, those with inferior myocardial infarction (MI) should have right-sided ECG leads placed to look for ECG evidence of right ventricular involvement. These patients should not be given nitrates, as this therapy may excessively decrease ventricular preload, thereby causing hypotension and worsening ischemia. If there is evidence of low cardiac output in the absence of signs of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, management may include judicious administration of intravenous fluids to enhance preload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right ventricular myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The location of acute infarction also has implications for the mechanism of atrioventricular (AV) heart blocks associated with different ECG presentations. Of note, AV heart block (second or third degree) in patients with acute or evolving inferior MI is usually localized to conduction abnormalities in the AV node (ie, above the bundle of His). In contrast, high degree AV block with an acute or evolving anterior MI is typically associated with infra-nodal block, especially when associated with a bundle branch block pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conduction abnormalities after myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple factors can affect the amplitude of acute ischemic ST deviations. Marked ST-elevation or depression in multiple leads usually indicates severe localized ischemia or ischemia affecting large regions of the myocardium. Conversely, substantial (&ge;70 percent) resolution of ST elevation promptly following fibrinolytic therapy is a robust predictor of both target vessel patency and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, these relationships are not universal since severe ischemia or even MI can occur with slight or even absent ST-T changes. </p><p>In the chronic post-infarction stage, localization of prior ischemic events has been determined by the distribution of Q waves when present. (See <a href=\"#H99427611\" class=\"local\">'Significance of Q waves'</a> above.) Q waves usually follow a similar distribution to the acute ST and T wave abnormalities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior, lateral, and apical MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ST-segment elevation or Q waves in one or more of the precordial leads (V1 to V6) and leads I and aVL has traditionally been used to suggest anterior wall ischemia or infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81914%7ECARD%2F62059\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef81914 graphicRef62059 \">waveform 1A-B</a>). Although characteristic ECG changes in leads V1 to V3 are considered typical of anteroseptal ischemia, they may be more indicative of apical ischemia. This was illustrated in a review of 50 patients with new Q waves in leads V1 to V3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Echocardiography and angiography showed that the apex was affected in all patients and was the only involved site in 26 of the 50 patients (52 percent); the septum and anterior and lateral walls were also affected in the remaining 24 patients (48 percent), but the degree of involvement was less severe than in the apex.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in another analysis in which 48 of 52 patients with acute ST segment elevations in leads V1 to V3 had an antero-apical infarct and a normal septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This is usually associated with reciprocal ST&ndash;segment depression in leads V1 to V2 or V3. Similar ST changes can also be the primary ECG manifestation of anterior subendocardial ischemia that may occur in combination with inferior infarction.

Relatively tall, broad-based hyperacute T waves may precede ST-segment shifts. When ischemic ST-segment elevation occurs as the earliest sign of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), it is typically followed within a period ranging from hours to days by evolving T wave inversions, and sometimes Q waves, in the same lead distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81914%7ECARD%2F62059\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef81914 graphicRef62059 \">waveform 1A-B</a>). T wave inversions due to evolving or chronic ischemia are often associated with QT prolongation. The T wave inversions may resolve after days or weeks or persist indefinitely. The extent of the infarct may be an important determinant of T wave evolution. In one series, T waves that were persistently negative for more than one year in leads with Q waves were associated with a transmural MI; in contrast, T waves that were positive in leads with Q waves were indicative of a nontransmural MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The resolution of negative T waves also predicts recovery of regional left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Complete normalization of the ECG following STEMI is uncommon but can occur, particularly with smaller infarcts and when left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion improve. Normalization is usually associated with spontaneous recanalization or good collateral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In contrast, persistent Q waves and ST elevations several weeks or more after an infarct correlate strongly with a severe underlying wall motion disorder (akinetic or dyskinetic zone), although not necessarily a frank ventricular aneurysm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74283\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74283 \">waveform 6</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">NSTEMI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) typically present with ST-segment depressions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T wave inversions in two or more leads. As noted above, reciprocal ST-segment depression can occur during an STEMI. For this reason, ST-segment elevation, which is sometimes subtle, should be sought in &ldquo;opposing&rdquo; (contralateral) leads whenever ST-segment depression is noted (eg, if ST depression is seen in leads V1 through V3, then the <span class=\"nowrap\">lateral/posterior</span> chest leads should be evaluated for concomitant ST-segment elevation). Note also that the clinical term &ldquo;opposing&rdquo; here refers more technically to pairs of leads for which positive poles are oriented at &gt;90 degrees to each other. Another set of &quot;opposing leads&quot; is constituted by lead III (positive pole at +120 degrees) and lead aVL (positive pole at -30 degrees). </p><p>As noted above, the association between Q waves and transmural infarction has been questioned and the presence or absence of Q waves may be more closely correlated with the size of the MI than with its transmural extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A related clinical issue is whether normalization of T wave inversions during exercise (stress) tests is a form of paradoxic (pseudo-) normalization, and hence a marker of ischemia. We believe that normalization of inverted T waves during stress testing is non-diagnostic and should be considered in the overall clinical context. However, this finding, by itself, is not a specific or sensitive sign of ischemia and should not be labeled as &ldquo;pseudo-normalization,&rdquo; which implies an ischemic mechanism, but simply as &ldquo;normalization.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">UNEXPECTED ABSENCE OF DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The greatest value of the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a diagnostic test is that the results are immediately available. However, the clinician needs to recognize that it has limitations in both sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. As mentioned above, the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) does not require an abnormal ECG.

In addition, most patients should receive serial ECGs to increase the likelihood of capturing relevant information. &#160;</p><p>An initially normal ECG does not exclude ischemia or infarction. However, a normal ECG throughout the course of acute MI is distinctly uncommon. Thus, if the initial ECG is not diagnostic, but the patient remains symptomatic and there is a high clinical suspicion for MI, it is recommended that the ECG be repeated at 5- to 10-minute intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Assessment of ST-segment changes may be useful in this setting. ST-segment shifts that occur in the same direction as the major QRS vector (so-called &quot;primary&quot; or concordant ST changes) can indicate ischemia or infarction. Such shifts may include ST-depression of at least 1 mm in leads V1, V2, or V3 or in leads II, III, or aVF, with elevation of at least 1 mm in lead V5. Extremely discordant ST changes (changes in the opposite direction of the major QRS vector of &gt;5 mm) were also reported to be suggestive of MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction/abstract/14,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,43</a>], although exceptions occur, importantly limiting the specificity of this sign.

While patients with acute myocardial injury due to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can initially have elevation of the J-point with concave ST-segment elevation, the ST-segment elevation typically becomes more pronounced and convex (rounded upward) as the infarction persists.
