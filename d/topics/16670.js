It is caused by either alternating or synchronous contractions of antagonistic muscles. Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders, and essential tremor (ET) is the most common neurologic cause of postural or action tremor.</p><p>This topic will review the surgical treatment of ET. The pharmacologic treatment of ET is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of ET are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215636795\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initially, drug treatment should be offered to patients with ET who have intermittent or persistent disability caused by tremor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis#H4584536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Approach to treatment'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who fail pharmacologic treatment with these drugs, the primary options are surgery with deep brain stimulation (DBS) or thalamotomy to treat persistently disabling limb tremor, and botulinum toxin injections to treat persistently disabling head or vocal cord tremor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=essential-tremor-treatment-and-prognosis#H587343169\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Essential tremor: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment failure'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with ET who have persistently disabling limb tremor that is refractory to medical management, we suggest surgical treatment with DBS in the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus rather than conventional thalamotomy, which, when done bilaterally, almost always causes significant dysarthria. Bilateral VIM DBS also commonly causes dysarthria and other adverse effects, but stimulation can be adjusted to relieve these side effects, whereas thalamotomy produces a permanent lesion and cannot be reversed. Unilateral thalamotomy is a reasonable alternative for patients with unilateral limb tremor if DBS is not available or practical (eg, if ongoing stimulator monitoring and adjustments are not feasible). Bilateral thalamotomy is no longer employed for patients with ET who have bilateral limb tremor because of a relatively high complication rate, especially speech dysarthria. Focused ultrasound is a newer technique that has become available to carry out thalamotomy; since this technique destroys brain tissue by high-intensity ultrasound, it should be regarded as an invasive procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment of ET, four electrodes are typically implanted in the thalamic ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus using stereotactic methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A few DBS studies in small numbers of patients have targeted fiber pathways in the posterior subthalamic area, but efficacy data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The electrodes are connected to a pulse generator implanted in the chest wall below the clavicle, and high-frequency electrical stimulation is applied to modify the activity of the target region of the brain.</p><p>Computerized programming of the pulse generator is most commonly done with a handheld device after the patient leaves the hospital to optimize the electrode montage, voltage, pulse frequency, and pulse width. Since there is no universal formula for programming, each patient must participate in the transaction to inform the programmer when the best settings have been achieved. Regular follow-up visits for program checks are necessary to maintain the best clinical benefit and to monitor battery life (usually two to five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of DBS for limb tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence from several controlled trials that DBS of the thalamic VIM nucleus is effective for reduction of contralateral limb tremor in ET. A similar conclusion was reached by guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) published in 2005 and updated in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Of note, the updated 2011 AAN guidelines identified no additional trials of DBS beyond those included in the 2005 guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two prospective trials of DBS in patients with ET found that unilateral DBS involving 23 patients was associated with a mean tremor improvement on clinical rating scales of 60 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Treatment in these studies was not randomly assigned, but evaluation was done in an observer-blinded fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one of the studies cited above, staged bilateral thalamic DBS was evaluated in nine patients with medically refractory ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At 6 and 12 months following surgeries, activation of the implant (ie, electrodes turned &quot;on&quot;) was associated with a significant improvement in motor scores compared with baseline. There was no improvement at any time point when the implant was &quot;off.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In studies reviewed by the AAN involving 82 patients, DBS was associated with consistent improvement in contralateral limb tremor as assessed by observation, writing tests, pouring tests, and activities-of-daily-living questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>A long-term retrospective study of thalamic DBS for tremor in Parkinson disease, ET, and dystonic tremor found that in 38 patients with ET, thalamic VIM nucleus DBS improved tremor scores after 1 and 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This occurred despite the fact that off-stimulation scores worsened between baseline and 10 years, indicating that progression of ET did not compromise benefit from DBS. The gradual increase in stimulation voltage and frequency that occurred over 10 years also indicated there had been progression in tremor severity. </p><p>Bilateral thalamic DBS is needed to suppress bilateral upper limb tremor, since unilateral DBS suppresses only contralateral limb tremor. Available data do not provide evidence for a synergistic effect of bilateral DBS on bilateral limb tremor and, because of adverse effects on speech and gait, bilateral DBS is rarely done for bilateral limb tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1,5,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of DBS for voice and head tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited and conflicting evidence regarding DBS for treatment of voice tremor and head tremor associated with ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two small studies reported that DBS reduced voice tremor in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], but an open-label trial found that unilateral or bilateral DBS was not associated with significant improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral DBS did not improve head tremor in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], while another involving 38 patients found that head tremor improved in 71 percent, was unchanged in 26 percent, and worsened in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An open-label study of bilateral DBS involving 10 patients with head tremor reported improvement in 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of DBS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects associated with DBS in all studies reviewed by the AAN occurred in 18 percent of patients; most were related to equipment malfunction or lead displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One procedure-related death occurred because of a perioperative intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additional adverse effects included dysarthria, disequilibrium, paresthesias, weakness, headache, intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, ischemic changes, generalized seizures, and decreased verbal fluency. Many of the side effects were transient and resolved with stimulator adjustment or with time. Moreover, with increased experience, the incidence of adverse effects has declined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97904254\"><span class=\"h1\">THALAMOTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With conventional thalamotomy, stereotactic surgical techniques are employed to create a lesion in the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus under electrophysiologic guidance. Gamma knife thalamotomy uses radiation delivered to the intracranial target, while focused ultrasound thalamotomy uses high-energy ultrasound beams to create the lesion. Neither of these latter two methods requires craniotomy, but they should be considered invasive procedures, as brain tissue is destroyed. Electrophysiologic guidance is not possible with these latter two approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97904317\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of conventional thalamotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that unilateral thalamotomy is effective for treating contralateral limb tremor associated with ET. Bilateral thalamotomy is associated with more frequent and often severe side effects, particularly impairment of speech articulation. These conclusions are similar to those reached by guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) that were published in 2005 and updated in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Of note, the updated 2011 AAN guidelines identified no additional thalamotomy trials beyond those included in the 2005 guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One clinical trial evaluated patients with tremor due to Parkinson disease, ET, and multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In one prospective study of gamma knife thalamotomy with blinded assessment of video data available for 14 patients (11 with ET), there was no significant improvement on most outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Delayed complications may also occur, including progressive neurologic deficits, which in some cases may be due to progressive radiation necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Later studies reported better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].

In a retrospective study of 86 patients treated with gamma knife thalamotomy that included 48 patients with ET and 27 with Parkinson tremor, improvement on all three measured outcome scores (writing, tremor, and water-drinking) was noted in 66 percent, while no improvement in any score was observed in 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Neurologic complications (transient hemiparesis, dysphagia, and sustained facial sensory loss) affected 5 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22317456\"><span class=\"h2\">Focused ultrasound thalamotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided high-intensity focused ultrasound thalamotomy is a novel method for the treatment of ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Although it is transcranial and does not require an incision, skull penetration, or an implanted device, it is an invasive therapy that produces a permanent thalamic lesion. The technique has received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe but the therapy is not yet covered by insurance in the United States. As experience with the technique accumulates at specialized centers, it may emerge as a reasonable option for refractory ET in patients who are unable to tolerate surgery or the multiple follow-up programming visits that are necessary postoperatively. </p><p>Approval was based on short-term results of a multicenter trial in which 76 patients with medically refractory ET were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to focused ultrasound thalamotomy (producing unilateral thermal ablation of the thalamic VIM nucleus) or to a sham procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At three months, the thalamotomy group had significantly greater improvement in hand tremor scores compared with the sham treatment group; the between-group difference in the mean change from baseline was 8.3 points (95% CI 5.9-10.7) and was maintained at 12 months (7.2 points, 95% CI 6.1-8.3). The thalamotomy group also had significant improvements in scores assessing disability and quality of life. Of some concern, the tremor scores in the thalamotomy group increased slightly from 3 to 12 months, suggesting possible gradual loss of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Adverse events at three months were more common in the thalamotomy group, including gait disturbance in 36 percent and numbness or paresthesia in 38 percent; these persisted at 12 months in 9 and 14 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>With further follow-up of the trial participants, including 19 of 20 patients in the sham group who were actively treated after the three-month blinded period, it appears that initial benefits were sustained in most patients at two years, although confidence is limited by a 12 percent rate of loss to follow-up and crossover to other therapies (eg, deep brain stimulation [DBS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Compared with preprocedure baseline scores, postprocedure tremor scores were improved by 55, 53, and 56 percent at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively (absolute reductions of 10.9 to 11.2 points). Overall, 62 percent of patients improved by 50 percent or more at two years, and 38 percent improved by less than 50 percent (including two patients who worsened slightly). No new adverse events emerged, and two patients with persistent paresthesias or ataxia at 12 months reported resolution of symptoms at 24 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARISON OF THALAMOTOMY AND DBS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that both deep brain stimulation (DBS) and conventional thalamotomy effectively suppress tremor in ET, but DBS appears to have fewer adverse events than thalamotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized, single-blind study that compared stereotactic thalamotomy and DBS in 68 patients (45 with Parkinson disease, 13 with ET, and 10 with multiple sclerosis), both procedures were effective, but thalamotomy was associated with side effects in three of six patients with ET, including cognitive deterioration, mild dysarthria, and gait or balance problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-essential-tremor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
