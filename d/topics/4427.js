The resulting aganglionic segment of the colon fails to relax, causing a functional obstruction.</p><p>In about 80 percent of patients, the disorder affects the rectosigmoid colon (known as short-segment disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In 15 to 20 percent of patients, the aganglionosis extends proximal to the sigmoid colon (known as long-segment disease). In approximately 5 percent, the entire colon is affected (known as total colonic aganglionosis [TCA]), and in rare cases the small bowel may also be involved. Outcomes are generally worse for patients with long-segment as compared with short-segment disease. </p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical management of HD are discussed below. The emergency complications of HD, including acute obstruction in the neonate, Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis, and volvulus, are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11266174\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hirschsprung disease (HD) occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 live births with an overall male:female ratio of 3:1 to 4:1; when the entire colon is involved, the gender ratio more nearly approaches 1:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. There is familial clustering for nonsyndromic HD, with an overall recurrence risk of about 3 percent in siblings for short-segment disease, or up to 17 percent if the proband has long-segment disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This recurrence risk is higher if the proband is a female, and is also higher if multiple family members are affected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most accepted theory of the cause of Hirschsprung disease (HD) is that there is a defect in the craniocaudal migration of neuroblasts originating from the neural crest, a process that begins at four weeks of gestation and ends at week 7 with the arrival of neural crest-derived cells at the distal end of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Failure of the cells to reach the distal colon leaves that segment aganglionic and therefore nonfunctional, resulting in Hirschsprung disease. Defects in the differentiation of neuroblasts into ganglion cells and ganglion cell destruction within the intestine may also contribute to the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least 12 genetic mutations have been identified in patients with HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The predominant gene affected is the RET proto-oncogene, with mutations in this gene causing a loss of function. Coding sequence mutations in RET are identified in about half of all familial cases and about one-third of sporadic cases. In one study, RET variations were found in 82 percent of patients with total colonic aganglionosis (TCA), as compared with 33 percent of those with short segment disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. More than 20 different mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, certain RET polymorphisms are associated with a particular phenotype of HD (short- or long-segment disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Most Hirschsprung cases are linked to RET, even without an identified coding sequence mutation, suggesting that noncoding variants of this gene play a major role in the disease. A common variant in an enhancer-like sequence in intron 1 of the RET gene has been strongly associated with Hirschsprung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A strong association has also been found between a certain haplotype that starts in the RET promoter region and extends up to exon 2, and this may account for many sporadic cases where coding mutations are not identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The RET protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase that appears to transduce growth and differentiation signals in several developing tissues, including those derived from the neural crest. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin have been identified as ligands for RET, and GDNF, which is essential for normal enteric nervous system development and is necessary for activation of RET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Mutations in both GDNF and neurturin have been identified in patients with HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Mouse models have demonstrated that RET is necessary for migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation of the neural crest-derived cells that give rise to the enteric nervous system, and the degree of aganglionosis has been shown to be proportionate to RET dosage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The strong association between trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and HD may be partly explained by mutations in the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule gene (DSCAM, <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/602523&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWAEPaCo+ULPScMuAUGd0PJbH+nyiil2Qg9Ejg+RGfpSt&amp;TOPIC_ID=5903\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM *602523</a>). In individuals with Down syndrome-associated HD, mutations in the DSCAM gene appear to result in over-transmission of a hypomorphic RET allele, thus explaining the predisposition to HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The same association was found for some cases of HD without Down syndrome. </p><p>Mutations in other genes have been described in a minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These genes include endothelin 3 (<em>EDN3</em>), endothelin receptor B (<em>EDNRB</em>), endothelin-converting enzyme (<em>ECE1</em>), the gene encoding the Sry-related transcription factor SOX10 (<em>SOX10</em>) and the paired-like homeobox 2b (<em>PHOX2B</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Endothelin receptor B and its ligand endothelin 3 are both involved in the development of neural crest cells. A genome-wide association study also identified an association with neuregulin 1 (<em>NRG1</em>), a regulator of enteric ganglia precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HD is associated with chromosomal anomalies, especially Down syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101015 \">table 1</a>), and several different monogenic syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73215 \">table 2</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) &ndash; Down syndrome is present in 2 to 16 percent of individuals with HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Patients present with symptoms of distal intestinal obstruction: bilious emesis, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium or stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The diagnosis can be suggested by a delay in passage of the first meconium (greater than 48 hours of age). By 48 hours of life, 100 percent of normal full-term neonates will pass meconium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In contrast, 45 to 90 percent of infants with Hirschsprung disease will fail to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. However, passage of stool within the first one to two days of life does not exclude the diagnosis. There may be an explosive expulsion of gas and stool after the digital rectal examination (squirt sign or blast sign), which may relieve the obstruction temporarily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Affected infants also may present initially with enterocolitis, a potentially life-threatening illness in which patients have a sepsis-like picture with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which can progress to toxic megacolon. Patients with enterocolitis require fluid resuscitation, intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy including coverage for anaerobic bacteria, rectal irrigations, and, in rare cases, an emergency colostomy. A rare complication of HD is volvulus, which can affect the sigmoid and less commonly the transverse colon and cecum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with less severe disease (usually because a shorter segment of the colon is affected) may not be diagnosed until later in childhood; in about 10 percent of individuals, HD is diagnosed after three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Such patients typically have a history of chronic constipation and failure to thrive. Although uncommon, HD can be newly diagnosed in adulthood. Patients present with symptoms of abdominal distension and a long history of refractory constipation without fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

For such patients, it is reasonable to evaluate with a plain radiograph, and base further testing on the results. (See <a href=\"#H166160486\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal radiograph'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166160008\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rectal biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis and may be supported by findings on abdominal radiographs, contrast enema, or anorectal manometry. Each of these procedures has advantages and disadvantages related to availability, technical expertise, radiation exposure, and invasiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The diagnostic steps depend on the level of suspicion for HD, whether there is concern about Hirschsprung enterocolitis (which requires emergency management), and on the available resources and <span class=\"nowrap\">institutional/clinician</span> preference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51156\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51156 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>In our practice, we generally perform a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema rather than suction biopsy as the initial diagnostic procedure. If a clear transition zone is seen, the study is virtually pathognomonic of HD and helps the surgeon plan the operative approach. If a transition zone is not seen, HD cannot be entirely excluded. We always confirm the diagnosis by biopsy even when the barium enema shows typical features of HD.</p><p>Some providers start the evaluation with anorectal manometry, followed by rectal suction biopsy if the findings are abnormal. If ganglia are seen in an appropriately performed suction biopsy, HD is excluded. Lack of ganglia on the suction biopsy strongly suggests HD, if the sample is adequate. (See <a href=\"#H166160218\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Contrast enema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants with suspected HD, a contrast enema can support the diagnosis of HD; it is performed without stool cleanout (&quot;unprepped&quot;). However, this test is not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of HD, especially in newborns or other individuals with a high clinical suspicion for the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. A contrast enema is also useful for presurgical planning because it may help the surgeon to localize the transition zone and determine the length of the aganglionic segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], although the location of the transition zone on imaging is not always consistent with its true pathologic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>The presence of a &quot;transition zone,&quot; which represents the change from the normal <span class=\"nowrap\">caliber/narrowed</span> rectum (aganglionic segment) to the dilated colon proximal to the aganglionic region is virtually pathognomonic of HD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59877\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59877 \">image 1</a>). The transition zone usually is in the rectosigmoid area, and is seen best in the early lateral and oblique views. In patients with total colonic involvement, the entire colon may appear normal but dilated loops of distal small bowel may be visible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. If a transition zone is not clearly detected, a follow-up postevacuation film 24 hours later may reveal residual retained contrast in the colon, which is suggestive of the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The rectosigmoid index, the ratio between the diameter of the rectum and the sigmoid colon, is typically &gt;1 in children without HD. Reversal of this ratio, although less often noted than a transition zone, is a useful sign of HD in infants and older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The use of contrast enema for diagnosis of HD is limited by false-negative results, which render this test less sensitive than rectal suction biopsy and anorectal manometry for the diagnosis of HD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65223 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/45,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,52</a>]. As an example, a digital rectal examination within a few days prior to the contrast enema may dilate the rectum and cause a false negative result. Similarly, classic radiographic findings such as inversion of the rectosigmoid index (RSI) may not be evident in studies performed in the early newborn period or in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Therefore, a contrast enema is not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of HD in a neonate with a high clinical suspicion of disease. In a single center retrospective study of newborns who were clinically suspected to have HD, 32 percent of those who had inconclusive findings on contrast enema were ultimately diagnosed with HD, compared with 2.5 percent of those with negative findings on contrast enema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, in patients with a low clinical suspicion of disease, a contrast enema provides good evidence to exclude HD. This was shown in a study that compared 50 children who presented with constipation and were diagnosed with HD to a concurrent cohort of 50 patients with idiopathic constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Significantly more patients with HD experienced delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and vomiting, and had a transition zone identified on a contrast enema. The presence of at least one of these findings was identified in every patient diagnosed with HD compared with 64 percent of patients with idiopathic constipation. Thus, the authors suggest that rectal biopsy may be avoided in children with constipation who lack all of these clinical and radiologic features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Anorectal manometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorectal manometry sometimes is used to aid in the diagnosis and is especially helpful in patients with ultrashort segment disease. It is helpful as a screening test because a clearly normal study demonstrating relaxation of the internal anal sphincter with distension of the rectum excludes the diagnosis of HD. Lack of relaxation of the internal anal sphincter with balloon rectal distension is suggestive of HD. Anorectal manometry has a positive predictive value that is reported to be 75 to 95 percent, but is less accurate in infants younger than one month of age and those with longstanding chronic constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/52,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55</a>].

If a plain radiograph is performed, the possibility of HD is suggested by signs of distal intestinal obstruction, ie, decreased or absent air in the rectum and dilated bowel loops proximal to the aganglionic region. Occasionally, careful review of the plain radiographs may reveal the transition zone even when it is not visible on the contrast enema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11266238\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other disorders that may present with intestinal obstruction in a newborn infant include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal malformations, including intestinal atresia, duplication cysts, or malrotation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-atresia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal atresia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meconium ileus due to cystic fibrosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease#H11986089\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;, section on 'Meconium ileus (MI)'</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders associated with ganglioneuromatosis, including multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders causing chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, including intestinal neuronal dysplasia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction#H10337704\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction&quot;, section on 'Genetic'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704000513\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other causes'</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meconium plug syndrome, a condition that occurs in up to 1:500 newborns and is due to colonic dysmotility or abnormal meconium consistency, leading to obstipation in the newborn.

A biopsy should be taken 2 cm above the level of the dentate line to avoid the 1 to 2 cm zone of physiologic aganglionosis that is normally present. A second biopsy should be taken proximal to the first one. Adequate tissue is obtained for analysis in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Repeat suction biopsies or full-thickness biopsies under general anesthesia can be performed if the initial biopsy is nondiagnostic (ie, if insufficient tissue is obtained).</p><p>The diagnosis of HD is established if ganglion cells are absent in the rectal biopsy, provided that the tissue sample is adequate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53381\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53381 \">picture 1</a>). Supportive findings include the presence of hypertrophic nerve fibers, increased acetylcholinesterase activity or staining in the muscularis mucosae, and decreased or absent calretinin-immunoreactive fibers in the lamina propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>].

Thus, a rectal suction biopsy is more sensitive and specific than contrast enema and anorectal manometry for the diagnosis of HD for children up to three years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65223 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/45,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of treatment is surgery. The goals are to resect the affected segment of the colon, bring the normal ganglionic bowel down close to the anus, and preserve internal anal sphincter function. Many surgical techniques have been developed. The choice among them usually is based upon surgeon preference, since the overall complication rates and long-term results are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>The traditional operation was an abdominoperineal pull-through in two or three stages, in which patients initially underwent a diverting colostomy (to allow the dilated bowel to decompress) with definitive repair performed later. However, most centers now perform the procedure in one stage, an approach that does not appear to increase complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/39,64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,64-66</a>]. Laparoscopic-assisted and transanal repairs are commonplace, and now preferred over the open procedures in most centers. The results seem to be equal to the traditional abdominoperineal pull-through with the added benefit of earlier resumption of full feeds, less pain, shorter hospitalization, and less conspicuous scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing totally transanal endorectal and laparoscopic-assisted pull-through, operative time was found to be shorter for the transanal procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. However, the incidence of serious complications such as enterocolitis, incontinence, and chronic constipation did not differ between the two procedures. The frequency of postoperative internal anal sphincter defects identified by endosonography was also higher in patients undergoing a transanal approach (69 percent versus 19 percent). These findings should be confirmed with data from other centers and with different lengths of follow-up to fully understand the implications of this operative approach. </p><p>Treatment of the emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease (HD), including acute bowel obstruction, enterocolitis, and volvulus, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should be alert for signs or symptoms of congenital anomalies in patients with suspected HD. For all patients with HD, and particularly those with syndromic HD, genitourinary anomalies, hearing impairment, and visual impairment are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100632 \">figure 1</a>). Assessment by a clinical geneticist is valuable for all patients with syndromic features or anomalies, and also for those with no apparent associated anomalies. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Associated syndromes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15424383\" class=\"local\">'Other congenital anomalies'</a> above.) </p><p>Patients with ultra-short segment HD may not require a pull-through operation, as discussed in the next section. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609909266\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRA-SHORT SEGMENT HD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;ultra-short segment Hirschsprung disease&quot; (USSHD) is sometimes used to describe a form characterized by a very short segment of aganglionosis extending 2 to 4 cm proximal to the internal anal sphincter. Most experts agree that this form exists, although there is some controversy on this point. </p><p>The clinical picture is similar to the classical short-segment HD (which involves most or all of the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon), except that the degree of constipation may be less severe and the complications of growth retardation and enterocolitis are less likely to develop. On contrast enema, the rectum may be dilated down to the internal sphincter and there may not be a visible transition zone. If anorectal manometry is performed, the anorectal inhibitory reflex is absent, as it is in the other forms of HD. The lack of anorectal relaxation is the physiological basis for the clinical features.</p><p>The diagnosis of USSHD is established by taking two biopsies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy taken just proximal to the dentate line that shows aganglionosis &ndash; This distinguishes USSHD from internal anal sphincter achalasia (which has similar findings on anorectal manometry, but in achalasia ganglion cells are present). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704000513\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other causes'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy taken approximately 4 cm above the internal sphincter that shows normal ganglion cells &ndash; This biopsy distinguishes USSHD from classical HD, in which ganglion cells would be absent. </p><p/><p>It is important to distinguish patients with USSHD from those with typical HD because patients with USSHD may not require a pull-through operation. Some patients with USSHD respond to bowel management with diet, stool softeners, and laxatives. Others respond to botulinum toxin injections. If these measures fail, a myomectomy should be considered, removing a 0.5 to 1.0 cm-wide strip of inner circular muscle in the posterior midline, from the level of the internal anal sphincter to the level of the normal ganglionated bowel.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities of bowel function are common after definitive surgery for Hirschsprung disease (HD), but most patients enjoy an excellent quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/72-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-79</a>]. The most common long-term complications are fecal incontinence, constipation, and enterocolitis. Fecal incontinence has the greatest impact on quality of life. Patients with trisomy 21 or other syndromes are more likely to have constipation or incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Total colon aganglionosis (TCA) has a much higher rate of complications and mortality before and after definitive treatment, compared with the more common forms of HD in which a smaller portion of the colon is affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. TCA also has a much higher risk for enterocolitis and poor functional results, including incontinence after surgery. Some patients, especially those with residual aganglionosis or stricture formation, may benefit form a redo pull-through procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constipation or persistent obstructive symptoms, which include vomiting, bloating, borborygmi, abdominal distension, and severe constipation, occur in 10 to 30 percent of patients after operative repair for HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. This can be caused by mechanical obstruction (eg, stricture), persistent or acquired aganglionosis, a colonic motility disorder (eg, intestinal neuronal dysplasia), increased internal anal sphincter tone, or nonspecific colonic <span class=\"nowrap\">dysmotility/stool</span> withholding behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The diagnostic evaluation typically includes a radiographic contrast study to evaluate for stricture, rectal suction biopsy to evaluate for persistent aganglionosis, and an assessment of motility (eg, radio-opaque marker study). Guidelines for the management of postoperative obstructive symptoms in children with HD have been published by the American Pediatric Surgical Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Those with total colon HD have more fecal soiling, but for most patients with HD, the disease-specific quality of life tends to improve as time passes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease/abstract/74,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2742204507\"><span class=\"h2\">Urological and sexual outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urological and sexual complications, specifically urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, have been reported rarely after surgery for Hirschsprung's disease.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

It affects the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon in approximately 80 percent of patients, but it also can involve more proximal segments, the entire colon, or (in rare cases) most of the small bowel. There is an increased risk for HD among patients with trisomy 21, and several other genetic syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73215 \">table 2</a>). Assessment by a clinical geneticist is valuable for all patients with syndromic features or anomalies, and also for those with no apparent associated anomalies. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Associated syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with HD, and particularly those with syndromic HD, genitourinary anomalies, hearing impairment, and visual impairment are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100632 \">figure 1</a>). Congenital heart disease is common among those with syndromic HD. The clinician should be alert for signs or symptoms of congenital anomalies in patients with suspected HD. Some authors have suggested routine screening for congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT) and for hearing impairment. (See <a href=\"#H15424383\" class=\"local\">'Other congenital anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with HD are diagnosed in the neonatal period when they present with symptoms of distal intestinal obstruction, including bilious emesis, abdominal distension, and failure to pass stool. A high index of suspicion is appropriate for infants with a predisposing condition such as Down syndrome, or for those with a family history of HD. Patients with less severe (short segment or ultra-short segment) HD may not be diagnosed until later in infancy or childhood. Such patients typically have a history of chronic constipation and failure to thrive. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An urgent full evaluation for HD is appropriate for newborns or young infants with the following features: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms of obstruction (bilious emesis, abdominal distension, and failure to pass stool)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Constipation and trisomy 21 or other condition known to be associated with HD, or a family history of HD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Constipation and physical examination suggestive of HD (tight anal sphincter, or squirt sign on digital examination)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">(See <a href=\"#H166160112\" class=\"local\">'Suspected Hirschsprung disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, affected infants may present with enterocolitis, a potentially life-threatening illness in which patients have a sepsis-like picture with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which can progress to toxic megacolon. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis of HD is made by rectal biopsy, which may be supported by findings on abdominal radiographs, contrast enema, or anorectal manometry. The diagnostic steps depend on the level of suspicion for HD, whether there is concern about Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC, which requires emergency management), and on the available resources and <span class=\"nowrap\">institutional/clinician</span> preference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51156\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51156 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H166160218\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment for HD is surgical resection of the aganglionic segment of bowel. The normal ganglionic bowel is brought down and anastomosed just proximal to the anus, and injury to the anal sphincter is avoided. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities of bowel function are common after definitive surgery for HD, although most patients enjoy an excellent quality of life. The most common long-term complications are constipation and fecal incontinence. Postoperative enterocolitis may also occur, and is a medical emergency. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;ultra-short segment Hirschsprung disease&quot; (USSHD) is sometimes used to describe a form of HD characterized by a very short-segment of aganglionosis extending 2 to 4 cm proximal to the internal anal sphincter. The clinical picture is similar to the classical short-segment HD (which involves most or all of the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon), except that the degree of constipation may be less severe. It is important to distinguish patients with USSHD from those with typical HD because that they may not require a pull-through operation.
