A general approach to the evaluation of patients with ascites, the management of patients with ascites in the setting of cirrhosis, and less common causes of ascites are presented separately.

In addition, lymphoma can be complicated by chylous ascites. There is a common misconception that malignancy-related ascites is synonymous with peritoneal carcinomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Malignant disease can cause ascites by at least six mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65840\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65840 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the phrase &quot;malignancy-related ascites&quot; is a more appropriate descriptor than &quot;malignant ascites&quot; since it includes all of these causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106170071\"><span class=\"h2\">Influence of tumor type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascites typically develops in the setting of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advanced cancer. Patients may have a history of metastases to the peritoneum or liver, enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, or a large tumor burden prior to the development of ascites. The origin of the primary tumor has an impact on the sites of abdominal metastases and the etiology of the ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancies of ovarian and urinary bladder origin as well as peritoneal mesothelioma tend to cause peritoneal carcinomatosis. In such cases, the accumulation of fluid is the result of blockage of the draining lymphatic channels (which normally keep the amount of intraperitoneal fluid low) and increased vascular permeability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonic, gastric, breast, pancreatic, and lung cancers may cause peritoneal carcinomatosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> massive liver metastases, which leads to ascites either because of tumor cells producing fluid into the peritoneal cavity, <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/compression</span> of the portal veins leading to portal hypertension, or liver failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphomas may cause lymph node obstruction with the accumulation of chylous ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The malignant cells of an effusion from a primary lymphoma involve the serosal surface, leading to symptomatic serous effusions containing high-grade, malignant lymphocytes, but with no detectable mass lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Primary effusion lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with underlying liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignancy-related ascites in patients with underlying liver disease is usually due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rather than liver metastases. The development of ascites may be the first indication of a primary HCC.</p><p>The four most common settings in which HCC-related ascites develops are in patients with chronic hepatitis B acquired in infancy or childhood (most common in Asia), in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, in patients with chronic hepatitis C, and in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In these settings, ascites often develops when the tumor volume grows to an extent that it replaces a critical portion of functional liver mass or that it invades the portal vein leading to portal vein thrombosis.</p><p>HCC that develops in the setting of alcoholic liver disease is often seen in patients with compensated cirrhosis who have stopped drinking and lived long enough to develop HCC. HCC can develop in cirrhosis due to other causes, but in these settings it is frequently detected during surveillance, when the tumor is not large enough to cause ascites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease#H61643912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Patients who require surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients often first seek medical attention because of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or early satiety. Abdominal pain may be due to a combination of factors, including nerve invasion by the tumor, stretching of the liver capsule, or (in those with tense ascites) stretching of the abdominal wall. The clinical manifestations of ascites are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites#H25272225\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with ascites&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Because ascites usually develops in the setting of a large tumor burden, patients have typically lost a large amount of weight before the development of ascites (despite the added weight from the ascitic fluid itself).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of malignancy-related ascites is based on the clinical setting, imaging tests, and ascitic fluid analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with ascites&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a known malignancy who develop ascites frequently do not require an extensive inpatient evaluation. Because the development of malignancy-related ascites in such patients is a poor prognostic sign, the diagnostic approach should focus on rapid evaluation and discharge, with treatment aimed at improving quality of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78972\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78972 \">algorithm 1</a>). On the other hand, the presence of ascites in a woman with epithelial ovarian cancer is not necessarily associated with a severely limited prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H106172257\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The general approach to the evaluation of patients with ascites is discussed in detail elsewhere. The discussion that follows focuses on the diagnostic findings in patients with malignancy-related ascites.

Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule can provide a rapid tissue diagnosis. Gastric cancer, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lymphoma, and rarely peritoneal mesothelioma can cause ascites accompanied by an umbilical nodule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected malignancy-related ascites should undergo imaging to confirm the presence of ascites, visualize the liver, and examine for other findings that might support the diagnosis of malignancy. We often start with abdominal ultrasound because it is inexpensive, readily available, and does not require exposure to radiation or contrast. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may also be performed depending upon the clinical setting and the patient&rsquo;s renal function (eg, in the setting of a suspected extra-hepatic malignancy, such as ovarian cancer).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal paracentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal paracentesis with appropriate ascitic fluid analysis is the most efficient way to confirm the presence of ascites, diagnose its cause, and determine if the fluid is infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

A study performed in a tertiary referral center reported that malignancy was the most common cause of chylous ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; however, the results may have been affected by selection bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By contrast, a prospective study performed in large general hospitals documented that cirrhosis caused 10 times as many cases of chylous ascites as malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Approximately 1 out of 200 patients (0.5 percent) with cirrhosis has chylous ascites in the absence of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The tip-off that the fluid is not infected is the predominance of lymphocytes. The presence of neutrophils may reflect a response to dying tumor cells. Antibiotics can be given initially when an elevated fluid neutrophil count is detected. They can be discontinued when it becomes clear (by positive cytology and absence of growth on bacterial culture) that ascites is related to malignancy and that infection has been excluded.

An adequate volume of ascitic fluid (generally 10 mL per bottle, but the amount will vary according to the manufacturer of the bottle) should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. It is unusual to detect spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with ascites due solely to peritoneal carcinomatosis.

The sensitivity of cytology depends upon the number of specimens processed, the quality of processing, and the cause of the malignancy-related ascites.

It is best to coordinate this with the local laboratory prior to obtaining the sample to assure proper processing and thereby maximize sensitivity.</p><p>For patients with ascites related to peritoneal carcinomatosis, viable malignant cells are exfoliated into the ascitic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In most cases, cytology will be positive if the fluid is processed optimally and if enough specimens are examined. If handled properly, a sample of 50 mL is often sufficient to make the diagnosis. Handling of the fluid should be coordinated with the local laboratory; some laboratories prefer a hand-carried specimen, while others prefer a specimen that is fixed in alcohol at the bedside. When the processing of the specimen is coordinated with the laboratory, 83 percent of first specimens from patients with malignancy-related ascites are positive or suspicious for malignancy (93 percent if two specimens are sent and 97 percent if three specimens are sent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, only about two-thirds of patients with malignancy-related ascites have peritoneal carcinomatosis.

It is predictably elevated and uninformed clinicians may inappropriately pursue the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The diagnosis of ascites due to ovarian cancer should be made only on the basis of cytology and not CA 125 levels.<br/><br/>Virtually all patients, including men, with ascites or pleural fluid of any cause have an elevated serum level of CA 125, presumed to reflect shear forces on mesothelial cells, so elevated serum levels are nonspecific.

In truth, cytology is almost 100 percent sensitive in detecting peritoneal carcinomatosis, but one-third of patients with malignancy-related ascites have other mechanisms of ascites formation. In such patients viable tumor cells are not found lining the peritoneum, and the cytology would not be expected to be positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].<br/><br/>Multiple ascitic fluid tests (eg, fibronectin, glycosaminoglycans) have been proposed to replace or supplement the cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/8,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30</a>].

Peritoneal ports and catheters can be considered for patients who are intolerant of repeated paracenteses, provided clinicians with expertise in their placement are available. Diuretics may be helpful in patients with portal hypertension (eg, in those with massive liver metastases, cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, or malignant Budd-Chiari syndrome) and are a reasonable first step in this setting. We do not implement a dietary sodium restriction in patients with malignancy-related ascites so as not to impair their quality of life. Peritoneovenous shunts, such as the Denver shunt, can be placed to minimize the need for paracentesis, if an experienced surgeon is available, though results with peritoneovenous shunts are often disappointing. In patients with malignancy-related ascites from advanced ovarian cancer, treatment options include surgical debulking and chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255965110\"><span class=\"h3\">Paracentesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic paracentesis is the mainstay of treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis that is not due to ovarian cancer. Case series suggest that approximately 90 percent of patients will respond symptomatically to paracentesis, with as little as a few liters of fluid removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Large-volume abdominal paracentesis is usually needed every one to two weeks, although the frequency should be guided by the patient's symptoms (ie, distension, shortness of breath, and early satiety).</p><p>Therapeutic paracentesis can be performed in the clinic office, endoscopy unit, or interventional radiology suite. In the United States, therapeutic paracenteses are often performed by interventional radiology nurse practitioners or an interventional radiologist. Hospitalization is not required and intravenous fluid infusion is not needed following paracentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The goal in patients with malignancy-related ascites is to efficiently drain all readily removable fluid. This will minimize the time the patient (and the escort who often accompanies the patient) spends undergoing the procedure, while maximizing the amount of time before the next paracentesis is required. In one study, the adoption of guidelines to minimize the need for image guidance, decrease the length of time needed to accomplish paracentesis, and eliminate of albumin infusion post-paracentesis led to a more efficient procedure with no hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As a result, the authors changed their policies, noting that &quot;some practices were placing unnecessary burdens on patients whose life expectancy was short&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>For hospice patients with symptomatic recurrent ascites requiring frequent large-volume paracentesis, home-based paracentesis may also be an option, provided a qualified clinician, nurse-practitioner, or clinician's assistant is available to perform the procedure. One case series of home-based paracentesis reported safe and successful drainage of 2 to 4 liters of ascitic fluid in five patients with symptomatic large-volume ascites in the setting of an advanced terminal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In that series, a blind puncture was performed in the right lower quadrant using standard sterile technique.</p><p>Peritoneal ports or indwelling tunneled catheter drainage systems can be placed to facilitate repeated paracentesis for symptomatic patients with recurrent malignancy-related ascites, although leakage around the insertion site of peritoneal catheters can be a problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/37-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-46</a>]. These techniques permit removal of the fluid at home by a visiting nurse, the patient, or a family member. Although infection is a potential complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>], the overall risk appears to be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and infections can often be treated without removing the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a series with 24 patients who underwent 155 drainages using a peritoneal port, 40 (26 percent) were performed at home. Only one patient developed an infection (4 percent of patients, 0.6 percent of paracenteses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Other grade 3 or 4 complications included hypoalbuminemia (three patients), hypotension (one patient), and hyponatremia (one patient). Contraindications include single or multifocal loculated pockets of ascites, peritonitis, or uncorrected coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>].</p><p>Unlike patients with ascites due to portal hypertension, patients with malignancy-related ascites can have large volumes of fluid (up to 21 liters) removed without fear of hemodynamic sequelae, including circulatory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/16,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,49</a>]. The need for colloid replacement to prevent hemodynamic deterioration after large-volume paracentesis remains controversial. Randomized trials of albumin infusion have not been performed specifically in patients undergoing paracentesis for malignancy-related ascites. However, clinical experience suggests that intravenous albumin infusion is generally <strong>not</strong> necessary in patients with malignancy-related ascites. Furthermore, giving albumin increases the time that the patient spends undergoing paracentesis, especially if he or she has to go to an infusion center to receive the albumin. The use of albumin in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis in the setting of portal hypertension is addressed elsewhere.

A serum-ascites albumin gradient &ge;1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is suggestive of the presence of portal hypertension, and diuretic treatment is a reasonable first step in this setting. Starting diuretic doses are 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>.

However, these shunts can be associated with several complications, including pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, infection, and death. In one series of 89 patients undergoing PV shunting for palliation of malignancy-related ascites, the 30- and 60-day mortality rates were 43 and 61 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Among the 38 patients who died within 30 days of surgery, 12 deaths (31 percent) were directly related to a complication of the shunt procedure. In addition, symptomatic relief was achieved in only 57 patients (62 percent) and only 28 patients (31 percent) maintained a patent shunt and lived for &gt;two months.

We generally do not suggest a sodium restricted diet (despite its benefit in ascites due to portal hypertension) since it may adversely affect the patient&rsquo;s quality of life. Patients with malignancy-related ascites have a short life expectancy and typically diuretic doses can be adjusted to compensate for the lack of a sodium restriction.

Malignant disease can cause ascites by several mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65840\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65840 \">table 1</a>). Thus, the phrase &quot;malignancy-related ascites&quot; is a more appropriate descriptor than &quot;malignant ascites,&quot; since it includes all of these causes.

Because ascites usually develops in the setting of a large tumor burden, patients have typically lost a large amount of weight before ascites develops.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with non-ovarian causes of peritoneal carcinomatosis who have symptoms from malignancy-related ascites, we suggest repeated large-volume therapeutic paracentesis rather than diuretics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Peritoneal ports and catheters can be considered for patients who are intolerant of repeated paracenteses, provided clinicians with expertise in their placement are available. However, because survival is short in patients with malignancy-related ascites, patients often do not require a large number of paracenteses. For patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis for malignancy-related ascites, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using colloid replacement with intravenous albumin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H255965110\" class=\"local\">'Paracentesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with malignancy-related ascites from advanced ovarian cancer, treatment options include surgical debulking and chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Tumor-targeted treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with portal hypertension due to massive liver metastases, cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, or malignant Budd-Chiari syndrome, we suggest a trial of diuretics rather than repeated large-volume paracentesis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Such patients can be identified by a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) &ge;1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Large-volume paracentesis can be used in patients who do not respond adequately to diuretic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H255965141\" class=\"local\">'Diuretics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with intractable malignancy-related ascites, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using peritoneovenous (PV) shunts (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). PV shunts have not been shown to reliably provide symptomatic benefit, and periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates are high. Alternative methods, such as repeated large-volume paracentesis, are preferred for management of refractory malignancy-related ascites. (See <a href=\"#H255965086\" class=\"local\">'Shunts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several specific antineoplastic treatments may be useful, depending in part upon the tumor type. For women with ovarian cancer, the most common cause of peritoneal carcinomatosis, the treatment of choice is surgical debulking followed by chemotherapy. Where available, intraperitoneal catumaxomab is an appropriate option for patients with malignancy-related ascites due to an epithelial malignancy, particularly gastric cancer. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Tumor-targeted treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For some patients, peritoneal drainage and antitumor therapy may not be needed if other palliative care symptom management approaches (eg, for dyspnea, early satiety, or abdominal discomfort) provide adequate symptom control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-ascites/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Runyon BA, Montano AA, Akriviadis EA, et al.
