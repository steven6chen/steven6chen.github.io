In 2015, 150,000 children &lt;15 years old were newly infected with HIV, bringing the total number of children worldwide living with HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to 1.8 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most reside in the developing world, with approximately two-thirds in sub-Saharan Africa. Most HIV infections in children are acquired via mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, labor, delivery, or breastfeeding. Therefore, the epidemiology of pediatric HIV is inextricably related to the success of prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) efforts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Developed countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States and other developed countries, the number of children younger than 13 years of age newly infected with HIV has decreased dramatically due to successful PMTCT interventions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the number of infants born with HIV each year in the United States dropped from a peak of 1650 in 1991 to 86 in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the United States, PMTCT efforts began as early as 1985 with the recommendation for HIV testing in high-risk pregnant women and the avoidance of breastfeeding in HIV-infected women. In 2012, the CDC presented a framework for the elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The framework includes the following interventions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of HIV infection in women and girls of childbearing potential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of infection among women and girls of childbearing potential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assurance of adequate preconception care and family planning services for HIV-infected women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early identification of HIV infection of pregnant women through universal prenatal screening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of adequate prenatal care for women who have HIV infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximal reduction of maternal viral load through appropriate use of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cesarean delivery when maternal viral load is not maximally suppressed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal replacement feeding as well as maternal support for lactation suppression</p><p/><p>Prenatal and intrapartum management of HIV-infected women is discussed in detail separately.

Transmission rates in the United Kingdom and Ireland have similarly declined to &lt;0.5 percent, with only nine known incidents of mother-to-child transmissions in women known to be HIV infected prior to delivery in the years 2010 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the United States and other developed countries, outcomes for HIV-infected children have improved in large part due to use of powerful combinations of ARV drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-hiv-infection-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-outcome#H18840582\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric HIV infection: Classification, clinical manifestations, and outcome&quot;, section on 'HIV infection treated with ART'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Developing countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2015, 150,000 infants and children were newly infected with HIV worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], 52 percent fewer than were infected in 2010 but still representing 400 new infections every day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although access to care and treatment services for HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings is expanding, it is estimated that in 2015 only 49 percent of children in need received ARV therapy and 110,000 children died from HIV and AIDS, meaning that 290 children died of AIDS-related illness daily.</p><p>More than 90 percent of children living with HIV in developing countries were infected through mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, around the time of birth, or through breastfeeding. Just as in the United States and other developed countries, in order to reduce the number of infected children, increasing emphasis has been placed on PMTCT programs with the use of ARV medications in the pregnant woman during pregnancy and at delivery and starting immediately after birth for the exposed infant. In 2011, the United Nations Secretary-General launched a new Global Plan to reduce HIV infections in children by 90 percent by 2015 and to increase survival rates of pregnant women and mothers who are HIV-positive. Although these programs continue to scale up on a global basis, only a portion of HIV-infected women in resource-limited areas have access to them. UNAIDS estimated that in 2015, about 77 percent of pregnant women living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries had access to ARVs for PMTCT. This represents an increase in coverage of ARVs for PMTCT from 57 percent in 2011, 45 percent in 2008 and 15 percent in 2005.</p><p>In 2015, pregnant women were better able to access efficacious combination ARV medications instead of the less effective single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nevirapine</a>. The largest decline in transmission from mothers to infants during pregnancy and breastfeeding was in eastern and southern Africa, where it fell from 18 percent in 2010 to 6 percent in 2015. In some countries, progress has been limited by inadequate health care infrastructure, poor linkages between HIV and maternal and child health services, and lack of awareness of the importance of routinely offering HIV testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>It is hoped that with continued expansion of PMTCT, this mode of transmission may become rare in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in resource-limited settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR HIV ACQUISITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behaviors that increase the risk of HIV acquisition include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having unprotected sex with an infected person</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having blood-to-blood contact with an infected person</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection drug use</p><p/><p>In addition, infants may be exposed during pregnancy, birth, and breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure through sexual contact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual intercourse is the major route of transmission of HIV throughout the world. The precise risk of HIV transmission from one act of sexual intercourse with an infected person is not known. Although some people have had multiple sexual contacts with an infected person without acquiring HIV infection, others have become infected after one sexual encounter.</p><p>In general, the risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection is proportional to the number of different sexual partners. However, for some women, a steady male partner who has sexual contact outside the primary relationship is the only source of HIV exposure.</p><p>Several biomedical interventions have the potential for radically changing the patterns and rates of HIV transmission. Randomized controlled trials in several African countries indicate that male medical circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends male circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package. The effect of male circumcision on HIV transmission is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-circumcision-risks-and-benefits#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal circumcision: Risks and benefits&quot;, section on 'Reduction in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p>Pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection#H7740894\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure through blood or blood products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct exposure to HIV-infected blood is an efficient way to transmit HIV. Exposure to HIV-infected blood may occur nosocomially through a tainted blood transfusion or through needlestick accidents suffered by health care workers, or in the community through the use of nonsterile razor blades for ritual scarring or traditional healing.</p><p>Compared with industrialized nations, countries in sub-Saharan Africa experience more transfusion-associated HIV transmission because of a higher prevalence of HIV infection in donor populations, a lack of HIV antibody screening in some areas, and a higher residual risk of contamination in blood supplies, despite antibody screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8230187\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure through injection drug use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection of illicit drugs is increasingly associated with transmission of HIV worldwide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection#H854710502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global epidemiology of HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Injection drug use'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposure through pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertical transmission of HIV can occur at any time during gestation and delivery, and through breast milk in the postpartum period. More than 95 percent of HIV-infected children worldwide have acquired the virus via vertical transmission. In the absence of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, the rate of vertical transmission of HIV is approximately 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although it is known that HIV can be transmitted early in gestation in utero, most transmissions (50 to 80 percent) are believed to occur during the time period near or during delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings#H536114919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in resource-limited settings&quot;, section on 'Risk of MTCT of HIV'</a>.)</p><p>The use of ARV therapy in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants has virtually eliminated mother-to-child transmission, lowering the HIV transmission rate to &lt;2 percent in some parts of the world. Prevention of new vertical HIV infections is one of the most powerful methods available to reduce the global impact of HIV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The overall rate of perinatal HIV transmission is approximately doubled in populations where breastfeeding is the norm compared with areas where breastfeeding is uncommon among HIV-infected women. The WHO guidelines emphasize that expanded ARV treatment for mothers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infants during pregnancy, delivery, postpartum, and the breastfeeding period could reduce the risk of vertical transmission to 5 percent or less in breastfeeding populations. Risk factors for and prevention of HIV transmission through breastfeeding are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hiv-transmission-during-breastfeeding-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of HIV transmission during breastfeeding in resource-limited settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGRESS IN PROVIDING PEDIATRIC TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continued emphasis on prevention of new pediatric infections through prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs and expansion of care and treatment services for HIV-infected children is critical.</p><p>Globally, there are a number of barriers to implementing pediatric antiretroviral (ARV) therapy on a wide scale. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of infrastructure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack and loss of health professional capacity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relatively high cost of some pediatric formulations of ARV medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perceived complexity of treating children</p><p/><p>Of the 1.4 million children &lt;15 years old living with HIV in 2015, 51 percent received ARV therapy, compared with 15 percent in 2009. The number of children accessing ARV medicines has more than doubled, from 275,700 in 2009 to 727,000 in 2015. However, this means that in 2015, 49 percent of children who needed treatment were still not accessing it. This gap must be addressed urgently, since without treatment approximately one-half of HIV-infected infants die by the age of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-pediatric-hiv-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2728792315\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
