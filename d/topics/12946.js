It gets worse over time and can affect other brain functions, too, such as learning and memory. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196544170\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Parkinson disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, Parkinson disease often causes only mild symptoms. As it gets worse, the symptoms can affect a person's ability to work or do everyday activities. When it becomes even more severe, people with the disease sometimes need help taking care of themselves.</p><p>Parkinson disease can make people:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake (doctors call this &quot;tremor&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move slowly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Become stiff or rigid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose their balance or have a hard time walking</p><p/><p>Parkinson disease can also make some people:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose the ability to think clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At times, lose touch with reality or see things that aren't there (these are called &quot;hallucinations&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel depressed, anxious, or less interested in everyday life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have problems with sleep, such as insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep) and daytime sleepiness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose the ability to smell</p><p/><p>The disease can even cause problems such as constipation, sweating, trouble urinating, trouble swallowing, and sexual problems. Some people with Parkinson disease get something called &quot;orthostatic hypotension.&quot; This is the medical term for a sudden drop in blood pressure that happens when a person stands up. This drop in blood pressure can make the person feel dizzy or lightheaded, or even pass out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196544177\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Parkinson disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, there is no test. But doctors can usually tell if a person has Parkinson disease based on his or her symptoms. Sometimes doctors use tests to make sure that the symptoms are not caused by something else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196544184\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Parkinson disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several medicines that can improve the symptoms of Parkinson disease. Researchers are also studying drugs that might help keep Parkinson disease from getting worse. But for now, no treatment can cure the disease.</p><p>The medicines used to treat Parkinson disease symptoms can sometimes cause serious side effects. For this reason, people often start taking them only after their symptoms start to really bother them.</p><p>If you are thinking about treatment, ask your doctor or nurse to help you understand the risks and benefits of the medicines you might take. Here are some questions to ask your doctor that might help you decide what to do about treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which medicines would you suggest I take?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are their side effects?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much are my symptoms likely to improve with each medicine?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not take the medicine?</p><p/><p>People with advanced Parkinson disease that does not improve with other treatments can sometimes get a treatment called &quot;deep brain stimulation&quot; (also called &quot;DBS&quot;). People who get DBS must first have surgery to place wires into a part of the brain that helps control muscle movement. The wires are attached to a device that gets implanted under the skin, usually near the collarbone. It sends electrical signals to the brain to reduce abnormal movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196544191\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise or do physical therapy, so that your body is less affected by stiffness and other symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Join social support groups, where you can talk to other people who understand your situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make your home safer, so that you are less likely to fall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72890 \">figure 1</a>). For example, get rid of loose rugs and clutter, and make sure all electrical cords are neatly tucked away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you still drive, have yourself tested to make sure it is safe for you to keep driving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn about Parkinson disease and its treatment. That way you can be actively involved in your care.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196544198\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-parkinson-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for Parkinson disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Parkinson disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-treatment-options-education-support-and-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Parkinson disease treatment options &mdash; education, support, and therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-treatment-options-medications-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Parkinson disease treatment options &mdash; medications (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
