Because even casual use of cocaine may be associated with acute or chronic cardiovascular toxicity, the large numbers of exposed individuals may present with sequelae related to the cardiovascular system. Thus, the cardiovascular history should include questions about cocaine use, specifically focusing on symptoms associated with ischemic heart disease.</p><p>Cocaine use is more frequently associated with acute rather than chronic cardiovascular illness. Among cocaine users who present to emergency departments, cardiovascular complaints, particularly chest pain, are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In such patients, acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial ischemia and infarction), aortic dissection and rupture, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and vasculitis need to be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The cardiovascular effects and complications of cocaine use, as well as the management of cocaine-associated ischemia, will be reviewed here. Other issues relating to cocaine use, including the general approach to patients with chest pain and a history of cocaine use, are discussed elsewhere.

Since reuptake is the major mechanism by which neurotransmitters are removed from active receptor sites, this inhibition results in potentiation of the response to sympathetic stimulation of innervated organs and to infused catecholamine. Cocaine may also enhance the release of catecholamines from central and peripheral stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The ensuing sympathomimetic actions (increased myocardial inotropy, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and coronary artery constriction primarily at the capillary level) are mediated by stimulation of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and result in increased myocardial oxygen demand and decreased myocardial perfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Other cardiovascular effects of cocaine include promotion of thrombus formation (via activation of platelets, stimulation of platelet aggregability, and potentiation of thromboxane production) and proarrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

However, it is likely that the number of patients in whom cocaine use is identified as a potential causative factor and who come to medical attention is small relative to the total population of abusers. In some cases, the relationship of the ischemic event to cocaine use is unclear based upon the time of onset of symptoms and the known pharmacokinetics of cocaine and its metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The reported incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain ranges between 0.7 and 5.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

The characteristics of cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia are indistinguishable from other causes of myocardial ischemia. The chest pain is often accompanied by anxiety, dyspnea, palpitations, and nausea. As a result, all young patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly those with the above characteristics, should be carefully questioned about cocaine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>All patients with chest pain following cocaine ingestion should promptly receive a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and frontal chest radiograph.

While the most common acute condition is myocardial ischemia, only approximately 6 percent of patients with chest pain and recent cocaine use sustain a myocardial infarction (MI). MI in this setting is unrelated to the dose or frequency of cocaine use, although approximately one-half of patients who present with cocaine-related MI have had previous episodes of chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Although several retrospective studies, case reports, and reviews argue that beta-blockade in the setting of cocaine-associated cardiovascular complications is safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/76-78,87-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78,87-90</a>], many of these studies suffer from methodologic shortcomings, including lack of evidence of clinical intoxication at the time of beta-blocker administration, potential selection bias of patients receiving beta blockers, and asymmetric use of ancillary medications (eg, NTG and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/91-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-95</a>]. </p><p>Nevertheless, evidence pertaining to the role of beta blockers in the treatment of cocaine-related cardiovascular complications is limited. Data from prospective studies accounting for 175 patients exposed to cocaine and then treated with beta blockers reported four adverse events (2.3 percent), suggesting a slightly safer profile than previously assumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. According to registry data, the majority of patients with cocaine-associated ACS receive beta blockers within the first 24 hours of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-the-cardiovascular-complications-of-cocaine-abuse/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, some clinicians may choose to give beta blockers as part of their management of acute cocaine-related cardiovascular complications. If beta blockers are given, they should be used in situations where benefits outweigh risks (eg, remote from cocaine exposure), and mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a>) should be used rather than nonselective beta blockers. Additionally, beta blockers should ideally be used in combination with an alpha antagonist or some other vasodilator without beta-blocking effects (eg, NTG or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>), and under close observation, including frequent measurements of vital signs and serial ECGs.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS; including myocardial ischemia and infarction), aortic dissection and rupture, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and vasculitis are potential toxicities related to cocaine ingestion. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major cardiovascular effects of cocaine appear to be caused by the inhibition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> reuptake into the synaptic cleft by sympathetic neurons. Since reuptake is the major mechanism by which neurotransmitters are removed from active receptor sites, this inhibition results in potentiation of the response to sympathetic stimulation of innervated organs and to infused catecholamine. Cocaine may also enhance the release of catecholamines from central and peripheral stores. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular physiologic effects of cocaine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ACS is the most common cardiac condition associated with cocaine use. The mechanisms of cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia include coronary artery spasm, a prothrombotic state in the coronary circulation, and increases in heart rate and blood pressure which increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Myocardial infarction (MI) affects approximately 6 percent of patients with chest pain and recent cocaine use, and is unrelated to the dose or frequency of use. Most cocaine-associated MIs occur in the absence of high grade atherosclerotic epicardial coronary artery stenoses.
