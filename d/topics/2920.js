The right atrium or both superior and inferior vena cavae are cannulated to divert blood through the venous line of the CPB circuit, with return of the blood via an arterial cannula positioned in the ascending aorta or other major artery. Typically, the ascending aorta is cross-clamped and cardioplegia is administered to allow the cardiac surgeon to operate on a nonbeating heart in a field largely devoid of blood. The normal physiologic functions of the heart and lungs, including circulation of blood, oxygenation, and ventilation, are temporarily taken over by the CPB machine so that other end organs remain adequately oxygenated and perfused. </p><p>This topic will discuss preparations for and initiation of CPB. Management of CPB is discussed separately.

However, IV volume expansion, usually a balanced crystalloid solution, may be necessary to maintain cardiovascular stability in response to blood loss or hypovolemia prior to the initiation of CPB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 2</a>). Use of hydroxyethyl starch solutions is avoided due to concerns regarding acute kidney injury (AKI) and impairment of hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>Transfusion of packed red blood cells is uncommon prior to CPB, but may be necessary in response to severe blood loss or while preparing for initiation of CPB in a patient with anemia. Transfusion of platelets is avoided prior to CPB because of the adverse effects of CPB on platelet function and the need for anticoagulation during CPB.</p><p>Urine output is measured before CPB, confirming proper placement of the Foley catheter and adequate bladder drainage, and subsequently as a gross indicator of renal perfusion and function. Effects of anesthesia and surgery typically reduce glomerular filtration and tubular function and may reduce urine output in the prebypass period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

A minimum post-heparin ACT value &gt;400 to 480 seconds is targeted, although evidence defining optimal ACT is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Blood sampling for ACT testing is performed at least three minutes after heparin administration to ensure that adequate plasma heparin concentration and an acceptable ACT value has been achieved.

(See <a href=\"#H1260711682\" class=\"local\">'Heparin administration and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p>Approximately 11 percent of cardiac surgical patients are resistant to heparin by one of several mechanisms, and resistance is more common in patients receiving preoperative infusions of heparin. Since heparin acts by binding to its cofactor antithrombin III (ATIII), deficiency of this cofactor is a potential cause of inadequate heparinization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Heparin resistance/antithrombin deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis of ATIII deficiency as the cause of unanticipated heparin resistance is uncertain if ATIII concentration was not measured in the preoperative period. In this situation, it is reasonable to administer additional heparin doses, up to a total of 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110924\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110924 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>]. Although there is no upper limit for heparin dosing, large doses will accumulate in body tissues. Subsequently, gradual release of heparin into the intravascular space may occur, typically after CPB has been terminated and protamine has been administered to neutralize heparin effect. This possibility of significant residual anticoagulation due to &quot;heparin rebound&quot; is preemptively treated by administering additional protamine as an infusion (eg, 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour)</span> for six hours after termination of CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombin-deficiency#H259732\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombin deficiency&quot;, section on 'Available AT products and dosing'</a>.)</p><p>If ATIII level is normal or unknown, other causes of heparin resistance (eg, thrombocytosis, elevated Factor VIII concentration, elevated fibrinogen concentration) may be mitigated by hemodilution with onset of CPB when the CPB circuit prime (up to 1.5 liters of crystalloid) mixes with the patient's blood volume. Thus, we consult with the surgeon and perfusionist regarding whether to proceed with initiation of CPB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110924\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110924 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>In patients with heparin resistance, plasma heparin concentrations determined by point-of-care assays such as heparin-protamine titration, if available, provide supplemental information. For example, if a total dose of 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of heparin has been administered and plasma heparin concentration is &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> proceeding to bypass is a reasonable strategy since this appears to be the critical heparin concentration of heparin required to prevent thrombosis during CPB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110924\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110924 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/8,13,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,17,18</a>]. </p><p>Rarely, a lower ACT value of approximately 350 seconds may be accepted for initiation of CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and additional heparin is administered by a fixed dosing regimen (eg, heparin 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour, or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> every 30 minutes if duration of CPB will be brief) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110924\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110924 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3487573934\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, a patient presents for cardiac surgery with a documented history of HIT. Heparin administration in such patients may cause platelet activation, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis. Decisions regarding systemic anticoagulation for CPB in such patients should include consultation with a local specialist who is familiar with institutional protocols for managing HIT patients during extracorporeal circulation. Management depends on the urgency of the procedure and whether an assay for HIT antibodies is positive, as described elsewhere.

Other agents and techniques to manage HIT in patients who require CPB are discussed separately.

Also, there is no standardized method to monitor the degree of anticoagulation during CPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">An advantage of these alternative agents is their relatively short half-life. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a> has a half-life of 25 minutes in patients with normal renal function due to its metabolism by blood proteases. However, there is some risk that unmetabolized anticoagulant agent may result in bleeding after CPB has been terminated. Conversely, there is also some risk that stagnant blood may coagulate in the CPB circuitry, vents, cardioplegia line, or chest as bivalirudin is metabolized. To avoid this potentially catastrophic complication, the perfusionist must maintain blood circulation in the bypass circuit using an arteriovenous bridge whenever perfusion to the patient is interrupted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoprostenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epoprostenol</a><strong> administration </strong>&ndash; Some centers use IV epoprostenol (prostaglandin PGI<sub>2</sub>) to prevent complications when heparin anticoagulation is selected for a patient who tests positive for HIT antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Epoprostenol is a potent, reversible inhibitor of platelet activation that works by desensitizing platelets during exposure to heparin and by increasing intracellular concentrations of platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate. After induction of general anesthesia, epoprostenol is administered as a continuous IV infusion at a rate of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/kg</span> per minute. The infusion rate is increased by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/kg</span> per minute every five minutes until a target rate of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/kg</span> per minute has been achieved prior to heparin administration. Since IV epoprostenol causes vasodilation, a vasopressor infusion (eg, norepinephrine at 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute) is typically necessary to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure. Epoprostenol is discontinued after weaning from CPB and administration of protamine to neutralize heparin anticoagulation. Discontinuation of epoprostenol should be gradual, in increments of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/kg</span> per minute every five minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1520349478\"><span class=\"h2\">Antifibrinolytic administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the recommendations of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons to administer prophylactic antifibrinolytic therapy using a lysine analog (eg, epsilon-aminocaproic acid [EACA] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> [TXA]) after systemic heparinization, to decrease the risk of intraoperative bleeding and postoperative mediastinal re-exploration for bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Antifibrinolytic agents'</a>.)</p><p>Dose regimens for these agents are not standardized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Typically, a loading dose of EACA 10 g IV is administered immediately after administration of heparin 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> and prior to initiating CPB; in some institutions, an additional 5 g is included in the CPB prime. The loading dose is followed by an EACA infusion at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/hour</span>. The infusion is maintained throughout the intraoperative period and up to five hours after the initial dose or longer if nonsurgical bleeding and excessive chest tube output persist in the postoperative period (eg, output &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for more than two consecutive hours). Dosing is institution specific. For example, a reasonable alternative is administration of a 50 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> loading dose of EACA, followed by infusion of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour. Timing of the initial bolus dose is also institution specific, but administration prior to systemic heparinization is generally avoided due to the possibility of a transient procoagulant state and thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>TXA is another lysine analog that can be used as an alternative to EACA for antifibrinolysis. As with EACA, dosing of TXA is not standardized. A typical loading dose is 1 to 2 g (or 10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> followed by infusion of 0.4 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/hour</span> or 1 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per hour, although some centers administer a single TXA dose of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/30,32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32,34,35</a>]. TXA has been associated with postoperative seizures, and the risk may be dose-related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/30,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35-37</a>]. In one large observational study, a higher dose of TXA was associated with a higher risk of seizure, although absolute risks were low (1.6 versus 0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For this reason, as well as cost considerations, EACA is used more commonly in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/30,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38,39</a>]. </p><p>Both EACA and TXA reduce fibrinolysis via inhibition of plasminogen activation and, to a lesser degree, through antiplasmin activity. Most of the efficacy and safety data are from studies of TXA, although EACA is used primarily in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/30,32,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32,40</a>]. These agents are useful to minimize nonsurgical microvascular bleeding in the postbypass period after reversal of heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There is no evidence of drug-related morbidity such as coronary graft occlusion or renal insufficiency for either EACA or TXA, although efficacy trials have not had adequate power to evaluate safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/40,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42,43</a>].</p><p>Another antifibrinolytic agent, aprotinin, is a serine protease inhibitor that is not available in the United States, but is being reintroduced in Europe based on a reevaluation of studies comparing it with EACA or TXA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/30,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1241295330\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic, venous, and coronary sinus cannulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical positions of the vascular cannulae utilized during CPB are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97188 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627668994\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic cannulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic cannulation is usually accomplished in the ascending aorta distal to the intended cross-clamp site but proximal to the takeoff of the innominate artery. </p><p>Prior to cannulation, the ascending aorta is evaluated by surgical palpation and sometimes also with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or epiaortic echocardiography to identify and avoid areas of atheromatous disease or calcification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112683\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112683 \">image 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery#H2179765506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery&quot;, section on 'Initial TEE examination'</a>).

If an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been previously inserted, balloon inflation and deflation are temporarily paused during cannulation.</p><p>Once the aortic cannula is properly positioned and all air has been removed from the cannula, the surgeon connects it to the arterial tubing of the CPB circuit. This arterial line is then &quot;tested&quot; by the perfusionist to confirm proper intraluminal placement. If using a roller pump, this is accomplished by initiating arterial flow to the patient and confirming that there is no unusual increase in arterial line pressure as flow is increased. If using a centrifugal pump, the perfusionist confirms that the expected flow is achieved with a set number of rotations per minute (RPM), while observing adequacy of the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP). If testing is uneventful, rapid administration of fluid from the CPB machine via this cannula is possible (eg, if needed to replace blood loss or correct hypovolemia before CPB is initiated).</p><p>Specialized aortic cannulae that incorporate embolic protection mechanisms are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. In one randomized trial in patients at high risk for calcific emboli, use of a standard aortic cannula (n = 132) was compared with specialized aortic cannulae that have an incorporated embolic protection device providing either intra-aortic filtration (n = 130) or suction-based intra-aortic extraction of emboli (n = 116) during valve replacement for aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. There were no differences among groups in the incidence of postoperative clinical stroke, or in the number or volume of cerebral infarctions detected by magnetic resonance imaging. </p><p>Less common sites for arterial cannulation include the right axillary artery or right or left femoral artery.

This so-called dual-stage or two-stage cannula provides excellent venous drainage with a single cannula since there are multiple holes near its tip in the IVC, as well as side holes located a few centimeters more proximally in the body of the RA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97188 \">figure 1</a>). Alternatively, the superior vena cava (SVC) and the IVC can each be separately cannulated through the RA. Such bicaval cannulation is used when it is necessary to enter the RA to perform the surgical procedure (eg, tricuspid valve operation) or if venous drainage would be compromised by distraction of the heart (eg, during surgical exposure for a mitral valve operation performed through the left atrium [LA]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446974304\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary sinus cannulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgeon may also place a cannula through the wall of the RA and into the coronary sinus before onset of CPB. This cannula will be used for delivery of retrograde cardioplegia during CPB. Although placement of the coronary sinus catheter is typically performed by surgical palpation, the anesthesiologist may assist by providing TEE guidance and confirmation of correct positioning of the tip of the catheter. Coronary sinus pressure is measured by connecting to sterile tubing, which is then passed off of the sterile field and connected by the anesthesiologist or perfusionist to a pressure transducer. Correct placement of the catheter may be further confirmed by noting the presence of pulsatile coronary sinus pressure with the catheter balloon inflated. For minimally invasive robotic surgical procedures, coronary sinus cannulation for cardioplegia may be achieved by the anesthesiologist through percutaneous right internal jugular venous cannulation with TEE guidance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery#H2017423816\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minimally invasive aortic and mitral valve surgery&quot;, section on 'Access for cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegia'</a>.)</p><p>Placement of the venous and coronary sinus cannulae requires surgical manipulation of the heart, which may cause hypotension, supraventricular arrhythmias, or blood loss. Hemodynamic instability usually resolves with administration of vasopressors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when the surgeon restores the heart to its normal position. Significant blood loss is treated by intravascular volume expansion through IV fluid administration or direct infusion of fluid from the CPB circuit into the arterial cannula.

RAP is performed over the course of two to five minutes as the perfusionist controls retrograde flow from the aortic cannula back into the CPB circuit before initiating full forward CPB flow. Vasopressors are typically administered during the RAP process to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 50 to 60 mmHg until full forward CPB flow has been established. An alternative technique is termed venous antegrade priming (VAP); this refers to diversion of crystalloid priming volume into a collection bag as venous blood drains from the right atrium (RA) into the CPB circuit during initiation of CPB. Either technique allows expulsion of 400 to 800 mL of crystalloid prime, thereby minimizing hemodilution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1007563984\"><span class=\"h2\">Discontinuation of ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once full CPB flow is achieved, lung ventilation is discontinued because apnea optimizes surgical conditions by creating a still surgical field.

Although the IABP has been used to produce arterial blood pressure pulsatility during CPB, studies have not demonstrated improved outcomes with this technique. Furthermore, inflation of the balloon within the descending thoracic aorta may obstruct blood flow delivered via the aortic cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229660142\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration of anesthetic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of volatile inhalation agents via the anesthesia machine is discontinued when CPB is initiated and is simultaneously replaced by administration of a volatile anesthetic via a vaporizer located in the gas line of the CPB circuit (in series with the <span class=\"nowrap\">air/oxygen</span> blender for the oxygenator) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

In a systematic review of administration of a volatile anesthetic agent compared with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), 2587 cardiac surgical patients in 45 trials who received volatile anesthetics had less mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% CI 0.35-0.85) and fewer pulmonary complications such as hypoxemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, atelectasis, pleural effusions, pneumothorax, and bronchospasm (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.95), compared with 2303 cardiac surgical patients receiving TIVA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

TIVA without inhalation agents is a reasonable alternative technique to maintain anesthesia, particularly if the CPB machine is not equipped to deliver a volatile anesthetic agent. Limited data suggest that TIVA with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> also has cardioprotective effects in cardiac surgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. </p><p>Some degree of hemodilution occurs with initiation of CPB, even if retrograde priming is employed.

Thus, drugs such as neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) that are primarily distributed within the intravascular space should be re-dosed when CPB is initiated, particularly if peripheral nerve stimulator monitoring shows a return of neuromuscular function. In contrast, re-dosing may not be necessary for agents with a large volume of distribution (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>) because of their rapid redistribution into the new larger intravascular volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/68,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2346121908\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic cross-clamping and antegrade cardioplegia administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to aortic cross-clamping, an antegrade cardioplegia cannula is inserted into the proximal ascending aorta. During periods when cardioplegia is not being administered, this cannula also allows venting of the aortic root to maintain a decompressed left ventricle (LV) during CPB. Just before placement of the aortic cross-clamp, the surgeon asks the perfusionist to reduce pump flow rate transiently so that MAP is reduced during clamp placement. After the aortic cross-clamp is placed, antegrade cardioplegia is administered to achieve cardiac arrest and myocardial protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is monitored to ensure complete cardiac arrest (ie, absence of myocardial electrical activity). The transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) are monitored for evidence of ineffective delivery of antegrade cardioplegia (eg, in a patient with aortic regurgitation [AR]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H277151819\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4225315387\"><span class=\"h2\">Retrograde cardioplegia administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to anterograde cardioplegia, it may be necessary or desirable to subsequently administer retrograde <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioplegia-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cardioplegia solution</a> into the coronary sinus to achieve and maintain complete cardiac arrest and myocardial preservation. Examples include patients with multiple coronary stenoses with potentially poor preservation of distal myocardium if only antegrade cardioplegia is employed and those with AR.

In other types of procedures, placement of an LV vent may be necessary to avoid or treat LV distention. For example, if AR is present during antegrade delivery of cardioplegia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97188 \">figure 1</a>), LV distention will immediately occur when the heart stops beating due to asystole or ventricular fibrillation. Prebypass TEE assessment of the aortic valve typically allows anticipation of this problem (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H277151819\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a>). However, unanticipated LV distention may be detected by the operating surgeon's direct observation of the surgical field. LV distention may also be noted by the anesthesiologist on TEE images or as a large increase in PAP occurring due to backflow of intraventricular volume into the left atrium (LA) and pulmonary venous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111033\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111033 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>LV distention is harmful because the increased LV wall tension may result in severe postbypass LV dysfunction. Thus, the anesthesiologist should immediately inform the surgeon if there is TEE evidence of significant AR, LV distention, or an increase in PAP. The surgeon introduces the LV vent via the right upper pulmonary vein, then advances it through the mitral valve and into the LV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97188 \">figure 1</a>). Correct placement of the vent and effective decompression of the LV are confirmed with TEE examination. Thereafter, PAP is continuously monitored during CPB to detect dislodgement of the LV vent or recurrence of LV distention. Venting the pulmonary artery with a silastic catheter placed into the main pulmonary artery during CPB is another technique for preventing LV distension during CPB.</p><p>After removal of the aortic cross-clamp near the end of CPB, the LV vent is employed to assist with removal of air from the left-sided intracardiac chambers to prepare for weaning from CPB. Intracardiac air can also be evacuated through the aortic root vent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97188 \">figure 1</a>). Near the end of CPB when adequate LV ejection has been restored, the LV vent can be removed.
