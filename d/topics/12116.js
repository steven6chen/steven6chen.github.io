It is also known as &quot;river blindness&quot; because the blackfly vector breeds near fast-flowing streams and rivers. The disease affects rural communities and is a major cause of blindness and skin disease in endemic areas with serious socioeconomic consequences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of infected people worldwide was estimated in 2006 to be 37 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. More than 99 percent of cases occur in 27 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57380\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57380 \">figure 1</a>). Overall, 120 million people live at risk of infection in endemic countries in Africa. Smaller foci of infection have been found in Yemen and Central and Southern America (Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil).</p><p>The first confirmed elimination of an onchocerciasis focus in Africa occurred Abu Hamed, Sudan, in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Four countries in the Americas (Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Guatemala) have completed the WHO verification process for elimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Transmission is ongoing in one focus in Venezuela and one in Brazil (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63640 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7537964\" class=\"local\">'Mass treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Onchocerciasis is the second-leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide: approximately 500,000 people are blind due to onchocerciasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The epidemiologic patterns of infection differ between savanna and forest regions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In West African savanna areas, ocular onchocerciasis is common; it particularly affects the anterior segment of the eye, though the posterior eye segment can also be affected. The risks of visual impairment increase, in part, as the prevalence and intensity of infection in a community rises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence of infection can vary between villages and was historically as high as 80 to 100 percent by the age of 20 years in some areas, with blindness peaking at 40 to 50 years of age. Prior to control activities, hyperendemic regions were frequently depopulated because of high rates of blindness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In African forest areas with a comparable intensity of onchocerciasis as savanna areas, onchocercal skin disease predominates, with much less blindness. Furthermore, ocular lesions, when present, usually involve the posterior eye segment. A multi-country study in highly endemic forest communities found that itching affected 42 percent of the population aged &ge;20 years, and onchocercal skin lesions affected 28 percent of the population aged &ge;5 years. Strong associations were found between the prevalence of skin lesions and troublesome itching and onchocercal endemicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By extrapolation, it is estimated that 6 million people worldwide suffer from onchocercal skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>The different savanna and forest epidemiological patterns are thought to be due to the existence of two strains of <em>O. volvulus</em>. The higher propensity for ocular disease with the savanna strain has been correlated with higher quantities of <em>Wolbachia</em> DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); <em>Wolbachia</em> are endosymbiotic bacteria found in <em>O. volvulus</em> adults and microfilariae that are essential for the filarial worm's fertility and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Blindness from onchocerciasis is less common in Latin America; this may be related to transmission intensity, strain differences, genetic factors, or other causes.</p><p>Black flies are not efficient vectors of disease; a minimum stay of 12 months in endemic areas is generally necessary to acquire infection. Thus, short-term travelers to endemic regions are unlikely to become infected, though medical staff treating returned travelers should be aware of this possibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are the only definitive host for <em>O. volvulus</em>, although there are a number of other onchocercal species that infect animals; a small number of human infections with <em>O. lupi</em> (a parasite known to infect cats and dogs) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Humans are infected with <em>O. volvulus</em> via the bite of a blackfly of the <em>Simulium</em> genus. The blackfly deposits infective third-stage larvae into the human skin, which mature into adult parasites (macrofilariae) over the next 6 to 12 months. The adult females measure 20 to 80 cm in length; the adult males measure 3 to 5 cm. The females live in subcutaneous or deeper intramuscular tissues and are surrounded by a fibrous capsule. The males migrate between nodules to fertilize females. The number of female worms can range from 1 to 60 or more (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66896 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Approximately 10 to 12 months after initial infection (the prepatent period), the adult female worms begin to produce microfilariae. Offspring microfilariae, which typically measure 220 to 300 micron in length, migrate through subcutaneous tissues. Adult parasites can survive for up to 15 years, and each female can produce 1000 to 3000 microfilariae per day. The total microfilarial load in highly infected subjects is more than 100 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>When an infected human is bitten by another blackfly, the vector takes up microfilariae. Over a period of one to three weeks, the filariae undergo maturation within the blackfly and develop into infective third-stage larvae, thereby completing the life cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adult worms (macrofilariae) become encapsulated by fibrous tissue and form subcutaneous nodules, often overlying bony prominences. The microfilariae move through subcutaneous, dermal, and ocular tissues and the lymph system. They provoke a minimal immune response while alive; when they die, they incite a clinical inflammatory response.</p><p><em>O. volvulus</em> adults and microfilariae harbor endosymbiotic <em>Wolbachia</em> bacteria, which are essential for the filarial worm's fertility and survival. Release of <em>Wolbachia</em>-derived antigens from dying parasites can activate innate immune responses and are thought to play an essential role in the development of anterior segment onchocercal eye disease in an experimental murine model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. <em>Wolbachia</em> bacteria mediate corneal pathology by activating Toll-like receptors on mammalian cells, which in turn stimulate recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/12,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14-17</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of posterior segment eye disease is less understood. Chorioretinal disease continues to progress despite elimination of the parasite from the eye, suggesting the involvement of an autoimmune phenomenon. Cross-reactivity has been found between <em>O. volvulus</em> antigen Ov39 and the antigen hr44 found in the retinal pigment epithelium. Hr44, however, is also found in the optic nerve and other ocular tissues. Transfer of Ov39-derived T cell lines, which proliferate in response to stimulation with hr44, have been shown to induce inflammation of the limbus, iris, and choroid in na&iuml;ve rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Corneal inflammation appears to occur in response to both <em>Wolbachia</em> and <em>Onchocerca </em>antigens, while dermatologic manifestations appear to occur in response to <em>Onchocerca</em> antigens alone, though the role of <em>Wolbachia </em>antigens has not been definitively excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There is a spectrum of immune response to infection; some infected individuals have a minimal immune response to parasite antigens, permitting proliferation of microfilariae in the absence of clinical symptoms, while others have a relatively robust and symptomatic immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An immunogenetic basis for this clinical spectrum has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and differing isotypic antibody responses may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the <em>Fc&gamma;RIIa</em> gene affects the binding to the different immunoglobin G (IgG) subclasses and may influence the clinical outcome of onchocerciasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A genome-wide search for genetic determinants of resistance to <em>O. volvulus</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] detected linkage between microfilarial load and chromosome 2p21-p14, though the decisive genetic variants have not been identified.</p><p>Cellular immune responses are stronger in individuals with severe onchodermatitis than those with milder disease or uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. T-helper (Th) 2-type responses to <em>O. volvulus</em> antigen, rather than Th1-type responses, were more prominent in a study of Ghanians exposed to <em>O. volvulus</em> transmission and, in skin snip&ndash;positive individuals, the levels of interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 decreased with increasing microfilarial density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Individuals with skin disease from this same area had more pronounced Th 2-type responses compared with individuals without skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subjects with a hyperreactive form of skin disease (sowda) were significantly associated with a variant of the IL-13 gene, which causes a brisk Th2-type immune response with high IgE levels and a resultant low microfilarial burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A state of hyporesponsiveness or partial tolerance of cell-mediated responses exists in asymptomatic persons with high microfilarial loads. Defects in T cell responses in human filarial infections have been linked with expression of the T cell-inhibiting receptor, CTLA-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Furthermore, a subset of CD4+ T cells, T regulatory-1 (Tr1) cells, which are known to suppress immune responses, were demonstrated for the first time in a human infectious disease in onchocerciasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Tr1 cells produce high levels of IL-10 and are thought to counteract Th2-driven effector inflammatory responses in such individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Elevated IgG<sub>4</sub> also acts as blocking antibody to inhibit IgE-mediated degranulation of effector cells and thus downregulates pathogenetic responses, and Tr1 cells have been shown to induce B cells to secrete IgG<sub>4</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Prostaglandin (PG)E<sub>2</sub>, which has an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses, has been shown to be generated by <em>O. volvulus</em> parasites themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta have been demonstrated histochemically in infiltrating host macrophages and plasma cells around <em>O. volvulus</em> in onchocercomas, and TGF-beta was preferentially observed in the skin of infected individuals with &quot;generalized&quot; or hyporeactive onchocerciasis and to a lesser degree in patients with the hyperreactive form of onchocercal skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Downregulation of host immunity may be induced by <em>O. volvulus</em> surface molecules and by excretory-secretory products. The secretory omega-class glutathione transferase 3 from <em>O. volvulus</em> (OvGST3) has a protective role against intracellular and environmental reactive oxygen species. Significant IgG<sub>1 </sub>and IgG<sub>4</sub> responses to recombinantly expressed <span class=\"nowrap\">OvGST3/5</span> were detected in sera from onchocerciasis patients, indicating exposure of this secreted protein to the host immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Cho-Ngwa and colleagues used molecular techniques to identify and characterize <em>O. volvulus</em> antigens that are possibly associated with the development of concomitant immunity. They studied IgG subclass and IgE specific responses to an <em>O. volvulus</em> cysteine proteinase inhibitor, onchocystatin (Ov-CPI-2), in putatively immune and infected individuals in a hyperendemic region in Cameroon and found that both groups had similar IgG<sub>3</sub> and IgE responses, but infected persons had higher IgG<sub>1 </sub>and IgG<sub>4 </sub>responses. In the infected group, IgG<sub>3 </sub>levels increased significantly with age, while IgG<sub>1 </sub>levels were high in infected individuals regardless of age. They concluded that anti-Ov-CPI-2 IgG<sub>1 </sub><span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgG<sub>3 </sub>may be involved in protective immunity in the putative immune and infected persons and proposed Ov-CPI-2 as a possible target for an anti-L3 vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis are ocular changes, pruritus, subcutaneous nodules, and onchocercal skin disease, in addition to some systemic features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627283993\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular onchocerciasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first ocular sign of infection is the presence of microfilariae in the eye in the absence of any other pathology detected by slit-lamp examination. Presence of microfilariae in the anterior chamber is associated with the subsequent development of anterior segment lesions and also progression of posterior eye lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Additional manifestations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Punctate keratitis &ndash; Punctate keratitis is a relatively common acute, transient finding. White cell infiltrates form around dead microfilariae in the cornea, causing &quot;snowflake opacities,&quot; especially at the three and nine o'clock positions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81475 \">picture 1</a>). Punctate keratitis is reversible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sclerosing keratitis &ndash; Sclerosing keratitis is chronic full thickness fibrovascular change of the cornea and occurs in the setting of longstanding infection, particularly in savanna regions. These changes start typically at the three and nine o'clock positions and can extend across the entire cornea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60874\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60874 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis &ndash; Uveitis in the setting of onchocerciasis typically presents with flare in the absence of an accompanying cell infiltrate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optic atrophy &ndash; Optic atrophy is a relatively chronic finding; optic disc pallor can occur following an episode of optic neuritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onchochorioretinitis &ndash; Onchochorioretinitis is a common chronic finding. The first layer damaged is the retinal pigment epithelium, and this is most frequently found just temporal to the macula. Subsequently, more extensive loss of the retinal pigment epithelium occurs with retinal death and atrophy and loss of the underlying choroid. The end-stage Hissette-Ridley fundus appearance is named after the authors who made the first descriptions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72413 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluorescein</a> angiography will detail chorioretinal lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Subcutaneous nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous nodules (&quot;onchocercomata&quot;) are typically 0.5 to 3 cm in diameter; they usually contain one or two adult male and two or three adult female worms. The majority of nodules are deep (not palpable), and they do not usually cause significant symptoms. They typically appear over bony prominences and have an apparent predisposition for different anatomic sites depending upon the geographical area, reflecting the different vector biting habits in different regions. Infections acquired in Africa tend to cause nodules over the iliac crests and around the pelvic girdle; infections acquired in Latin America are more commonly associated with nodules on the head, neck, and upper extremities. It is often helpful to ask the patient if they know where any nodules are located, then stand behind the patient to palpate, following a set routine checking all preferred sites (eg, head and shoulder girdle first, then ribs, iliac crests, ischial tuberosities, sacrococcygeal region, trochanters, knees, and ankles).</p><p>Ultrasonography can be useful for detection of deeper, nonpalpable nodules. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627284048\"><span class=\"h2\">Onchocercal skin disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized itching is often the first manifestation of infection, and onchocerciasis should be considered as a possible diagnosis whenever a patient from an endemic area presents with itching or has an itchy rash. Early dermatological signs due to onchocerciasis include intensely pruritic inflammatory papules, nodules, and plaques. Subsequent lymphadenopathy can develop, most commonly in the inguinal region. After prolonged enlargement and inflammation, the lymph nodes may become fibrotic, resulting in lymphatic obstruction and sometimes genital elephantiasis.</p><p>Onchocercal skin disease may be classified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute papular onchodermatitis &ndash; Acute papular onchodermatitis (APOD) manifests as small (1 to 3 mm diameter) scattered pruritic papules, vesicles, or pustules often across the shoulders or buttocks. It is common in children and young adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic papular onchodermatitis &ndash; Chronic papular onchodermatitis (CPOD) comprises larger (approximately 3 to 9 mm diameter), flat-topped pruritic papules, often symmetrically distributed over buttocks, waist, and shoulders. It is seen in children and adults and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lichenified onchodermatitis (sowda) &ndash; Lichenified onchodermatitis (LOD) is a regular feature of onchocerciasis in some regions, particularly Yemen and Sudan, although it is seen less commonly elsewhere. Teenagers and young adult males typically manifest with hyperpigmented pruritic papules and plaques limited to one limb with associated edema and soft enlargement of the draining lymph nodes. It is also known as &quot;sowda&quot; (Arabic for black or dark).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin atrophy &ndash; Skin atrophy manifests with loss of skin elasticity and excessive wrinkling of the skin around the buttocks, waist, and upper thighs in adults; the resulting skin has the appearance of tissue paper. In order to avoid confusion with senile atrophy of the skin, the term onchocercal atrophy is reserved for individuals aged less than 50 years old.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hanging groin &ndash; Hanging groin is atrophy affecting the skin of the groin and anterior thigh. Inguinal lymph nodes enlarge in a sling of atrophic skin on the medial thigh, then, as the nodes shrink and become fibrotic, they leave redundant folds of loose skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depigmentation &ndash; Depigmentation (leopard skin) typically occurs on the anterior shins of older adults. The inguinal regions and external genitalia may also be affected. Patches of complete pigment loss are seen with peri-follicular &quot;spots&quot; or islands of normally pigmented skin giving rise to the so-called &quot;leopard skin&quot; appearance. Atrophy and depigmentation are not usually itchy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627284057\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study in Malawi, generalized musculoskeletal complaints, backache, and joint pains were more frequent in infected than uninfected individuals. In addition, infected individuals weighed significantly less than uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Inguinal and femoral herniae are common.</p><p>Nodding syndrome, an epileptic disorder of uncertain etiology that occurs in children in East Africa, has been associated epidemiologically with <em>O. volvulus</em> infection; the association has been controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies noted that onchocerciasis is associated with epilepsy, with an average increase in epilepsy prevalence by 0.4 percent for each 10 percent increase in onchocerciasis prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, a subsequent study in an endemic area of Tanzania noted no difference in microfilarial density between individuals with or without epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A later systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies supported the hypothesis that intensity of infection with <em>O. volvulus </em>is involved in the etiology of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Autoantibodies to leiomodin-1 have been found more abundantly in patients with nodding syndrome compared with unaffected village controls and were cross-reactive with <em>O. volvulus </em>antigens, suggesting that nodding syndrome is an autoimmune form of epilepsy caused by molecular mimicry with <em>O. volvulus</em> antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Data from the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in 11 countries in West Africa have shown that mortality was significantly associated with increasing microfilarial load but not with blindness per se (after controlling for other variables) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The relationship between microfilarial load and mortality appears to be nonlinear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Travelers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Onchocerciasis among returned travelers from endemic areas is relatively rare; a minimum stay of 12 months in endemic areas is generally necessary to acquire infection. If infection does occur, it tends to manifest with itching <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a subtle itchy papular rash, which is often concentrated on one limb. There may be accompanying limb edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and swelling may also occur without any rash. Other early manifestations include transient urticaria, arthralgia, and fever. The chronic skin changes and eye changes typically seen in long-term residents of endemic areas are generally absent. Symptoms develop in a median period of 18 months from the time of exposure (range: three months to three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], so a detailed travel history is important. Persons who have spent many years in endemic areas (though grew up in a nonendemic area) may present with symptoms within shorter times of leaving endemic areas. Ocular signs are relatively rare in patients with imported onchocerciasis. When long-term residents of endemic areas migrate to nonendemic areas, they may manifest more chronic skin and eye pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627284066\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV coinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV may affect the clinical presentation of onchocerciasis, as well as the immune response to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>], although there does not appear to be an effect of HIV on onchocerciasis prevalence or vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] or on response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Consequently, one would not expect HIV-infected individuals to be at greater risk of infection. Among six individuals with HIV in a hyperendemic area of Uganda where onchocercal skin disease is common, the burden of skin disease was higher than among patients with onchocerciasis in the absence of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/40,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,56</a>]. Inclusion of HIV-infected patients in mass treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis appears to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627284074\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIOECONOMIC AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High levels of blindness in African savanna regions resulted in desertion of affected villages with resettlement to less fertile areas, with serious adverse economic consequences. In a study in highly endemic areas of Guinea, blindness (and, to a lesser extent, visual impairment) were associated with substantial mobility and occupational impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Rates of celibacy, widowhood, and divorce were higher among patients with ocular onchocerciasis than uninfected individuals.</p><p>Onchocercal skin disease is also a significant cause of stigma, disability, and diminished agricultural productivity throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Even after 10 years of community treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> in southeast Nigeria, the most worrisome consequence of onchocerciasis for those with symptoms and signs was social seclusion or stigmatization (affecting 34 percent of individuals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Severe onchocercal skin disease in heads of households is associated with a higher school dropout rate among children, especially girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. It is estimated that 40 percent of the disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) lost from onchocerciasis occur as a result of blindness; 60 percent of DALYS lost occur as a result of skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of onchocerciasis is based on a history of compatible epidemiologic exposure, clinical manifestations as described above, and supportive laboratory evidence of infection. The clinical picture may be difficult to distinguish from loiasis and from infection due to <em>Mansonella</em> species. Nonspecific laboratory findings in patients with onchocerciasis may include peripheral eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinemia. However, eosinophil counts are normal in up to 30 percent of infected individuals from endemic areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin snips</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin snips are the gold standard for investigation of an individual patient. A skin snip may be performed with a corneoscleral punch or with a small needle and disposable razor blade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51397 \">picture 4</a>). It should be a bloodless specimen from the level of the dermal papillae. The site of the skin snip is selected on the basis of the site that is likely to give the highest numbers of microfilariae. In Central America, the best site is over the scapula or iliac crest; in Africa, the pelvic girdle, buttocks, and external thigh; in Yemen, the lower calf. In early infections and in localized light infections, the site selected should be that in which the dermatitis is most marked.</p><p>A minimum of two snips should be taken; the sensitivity of the test increases if more snips are taken. For investigation of a returned traveler, often a set of six snips are taken, one from over each scapula, each iliac crest, and each calf [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The biopsy specimen should be incubated in saline for up to 24 hours before evaluating for presence of motile microfilariae. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the specimen may be required for species identification, particularly in areas where other filarial species are also endemic. <em>O. volvulus</em> microfilariae characteristically have no sheath and no nuclei in their tails (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70061\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70061 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>It takes approximately 9 to 15 months for the worm to mature and release enough microfilariae to be detectable by skin snip. Skin snips are inadequate for detecting early or light infection, and they are often negative in expatriates and in patients with sowda. (See <a href=\"#H627284048\" class=\"local\">'Onchocercal skin disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Improved methods of diagnosis are needed for evaluation of individual patients and monitoring of onchocerciasis elimination programs.

Prior to slit-lamp examination, patients should be asked to sit forward (with the head between the knees) for at least two minutes to improve the likelihood of visualization. Transparent live microfilariae may also be seen coiled in the cornea. Punctate keratitis represents dead microfilariae surrounded by an inflammatory infiltrate; it is easier to see than live organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Mazzotti test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Mazzotti test should not be used as a routine diagnostic test; it may be considered if onchocerciasis is suspected in the absence of findings on skin snip or slit-lamp evaluation. It is contraindicated in heavily infected individuals (who will have positive skin snips) and individuals with optic nerve disease.</p><p>The Mazzotti test consists of a 50 mg oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diethylcarbamazine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diethylcarbamazine</a> (DEC), which leads to microfilarial death and associated symptoms of worsening pruritus about 20 to 90 minutes later; an acute papular rash with edema, fever, cough, and musculoskeletal symptoms may also occur. Symptoms generally reach a peak at about 24 hours and then subside over the next 48 to 72 hours. In some cases, severe systemic reactions can develop, including pulmonary edema, visual loss, collapse, and death. In the United States, DEC is not available for this indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627284083\"><span class=\"h3\">Patch test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DEC can be administered as a topical preparation to a small area of the skin to assess for local skin reaction. In a study of untreated children in Cameroon, Gabon, and Central African Republic, the proportion of children who tested positive with a 10 percent DEC solution ranged from 25 to 77 percent; this finding correlated closely with the prevalence of nodules (a reflection of the level of endemicity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Sensitivity may be greater with a 20 percent DEC solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Patch testing is a useful alternative to skin snipping in low-prevalence areas, since it is noninvasive, inexpensive, and more sensitive than skin snipping. The African Program for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) has recommended its widespread use as a preferred alternative to skin snip for epidemiological evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Standard anti-filaria enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have significant cross-reactivity between filarial parasites. Some recombinant purified antigens, ELISAs, and Western blot techniques with very good sensitivity and specificity for <em>O. volvulus</em> have been developed, but they are not routinely available for clinical use.</p><p>Detection of antibody subclass IgG<sub>4</sub> may enhance specificity. An immunochromatographic (ICT) card test detecting IgG<sub>4</sub> against recombinant <em>Onchocerca </em>antigen Ov-16 (Ov-16 card test) had very good sensitivities in West Africa field trials (81 and 77 percent in two villages). Test specificity was 100 percent (using the skin snip test as the gold standard) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onchocerciasis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>A serologic test using a multi-antigen quick luciferase immunoprecipitation system (QLIPS) and four recombinant antigens has been developed for diagnosis of <em>O. volvulus</em>.

For distinguishing <em>O. volvulus</em> from <em>W. bancrofti</em>, <em>L. loa</em>, and <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>, specificities of 76, 84, and 93 percent have been reported. The assay could be used for diagnosis of individual infections, for early detection of recrudescent infections in control areas, and for mapping new areas of transmission.</p><p>In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be of assistance with diagnostic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigen tests may be more useful than antibody detection assays for the diagnosis of individual infections and for monitoring the success of therapy, since they are positive only in individuals with active infection.

It is also known as &quot;river blindness&quot; because the blackfly vector breeds near fast-flowing streams and rivers. The disease affects rural communities and is a major cause of blindness and skin disease in endemic areas. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humans are infected with <em>O. volvulus</em> via the bite of a blackfly of the <em>Simulium </em>genus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66896 \">figure 3</a>). The blackfly deposits infective third-stage larvae into the human skin, which mature into adult parasites (macrofilariae) over the next 6 to 12 months. The females live in subcutaneous or deeper intramuscular tissues and are surrounded by a fibrous capsule. The males migrate between nodules to fertilize females. Approximately 12 months after initial infection the adult female worms begin to produce microfilariae, which migrate through subcutaneous tissues, dermal, and ocular tissues. When an infected human is bitten by another blackfly, the fly takes up dermal microfilariae. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life cycle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis include eye involvement, subcutaneous nodules, skin involvement, and systemic manifestations. Manifestations of ocular onchocerciasis include punctate and sclerosing keratitis, uveitis, optic atrophy, and chorioretinitis. Manifestations of onchocercal skin disease include acute and chronic papular onchodermatitis, lichenified onchodermatitis, skin atrophy, hanging groin, and depigmentation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of onchocerciasis is based on a history of compatible epidemiologic exposure, clinical manifestations, and supportive laboratory evidence of infection. A skin snip biopsy is the gold standard for investigation of a patient. Slit-lamp examination can be used to look for wriggling microfilariae within the anterior chamber of the eye. Mazzotti testing should be performed only in certain clinical circumstances. Serology, antigen testing, and polymerase chain reaction are useful tools though are generally not available in endemic areas. Ultrasonography of subcutaneous nodules may be useful for identification of adult worms.
