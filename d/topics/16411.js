However, most sore throats are caused by a virus, and are not strep throat.</p><p>About 3 out of every 10 children with a sore throat actually have strep throat. It is most common in school-age children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295565\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I tell if my child has strep throat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is hard to tell the difference between strep throat and a sore throat caused by a virus. But there are some clues you can look for.</p><p>People who have strep throat often have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe throat pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen glands in the neck</p><p/><p>You might also be able to see redness on the roof of your child's mouth, or white patches in the back of the throat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78761\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78761 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Children older than 5 who have strep throat <strong>do not</strong> usually have a cough, runny nose, or itchy or red eyes. Strep throat is uncommon in very young children, but if they do get it, it can cause a runny or stuffy nose, plus a slight fever. Babies with strep throat might act fussy and not want to eat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295572\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for strep throat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you think your child might have strep throat, a doctor or nurse can check for it easily. He or she can run a swab (Q-Tip) along the back of your child's throat, and test it for the bacteria that cause strep throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295579\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my child need antibiotics?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a test shows that your child has strep throat, then yes, he or she needs antibiotics. Most people with strep throat get better without antibiotics, but doctors and nurses often prescribe them anyway. That's because antibiotics can prevent problems that strep throat can sometimes cause. Plus, antibiotics can reduce the symptoms of strep throat and keep it from spreading to other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295586\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Make sure that your child takes his or her antibiotics as directed. There are also other ways to help relieve symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Soothing foods and drinks</strong> &ndash; Give your child things that are easy to swallow, like tea or soup, or popsicles to suck on. Your child might not feel like eating or drinking, but it's important that he or she gets enough liquids. Offer different warm and cold drinks for your child to try.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can help with throat pain. The right dose depends on your child's weight, so ask your child's doctor how much to give.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines that contain aspirin to children younger than 18 years. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome. Do not give children throat sprays or cough drops, either. Throat sprays and cough drops contain medicine, but they are no better at relieving throat pain than hard candies. Plus, throat sprays can cause an allergic reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other treatments</strong> &ndash; For children who are older than 4 to 5 years, sucking on hard candies or a lollipop might help. For children older than 6 to 8 years, gargling with salt water might help.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295593\"><span class=\"h1\">When can my child go back to school?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child should be on antibiotics before going back to school. This is to avoid spreading the infection to others. If your child starts taking antibiotics by 5:00 PM, he or she will probably no longer be contagious by the next morning. If your child is feeling better and no longer has a fever, the doctor might say that he or she can return to school that day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295600\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I keep my child from getting strep throat again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wash your child's hands often with soap and water. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infection. You can use an alcohol rub instead, but make sure the hand rub gets everywhere on your child's hands.</p><p>Try to teach your child about other ways to avoid spreading germs, such as not touching his or her face after being around a sick person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295550\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
