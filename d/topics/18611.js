When your heart beats too fast, it can't pump blood as well. This can lead to dizziness, fainting, or death. Doctors often call ventricular tachycardia &quot;V-tach&quot; or &quot;VT.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12074446\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes ventricular tachycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular tachycardia is caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system. The heart's ventricles (the main parts of the heart that pump blood) send abnormal electrical signals that speed up your heartbeat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56936\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56936 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The electrical system problem is usually caused by another heart condition, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection in the heart, called myocarditis</p><p/><p>Ventricular tachycardia can also be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines used to control heart rhythm problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in your blood (such as having too little or too much of certain chemicals in your blood)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not getting enough oxygen</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12074461\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ventricular tachycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your heartbeat speeds up for only a few seconds, you might not feel like anything is wrong. If it lasts longer, you might notice your heart is beating fast, beating hard, or seems to skip a beat. These kinds of heartbeat changes are called &quot;palpitations.&quot; Other symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12074476\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for ventricular tachycardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You might need many different tests, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram &ndash; This test, also known as an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG,&quot; measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Holter monitor &ndash; This is a small, portable machine you wear that records all your heart's electrical activity over 1 or 2 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76605 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>Plus, your doctor might do other tests to find the cause of your ventricular tachycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12074491\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>If you do not have these problems, but you often feel your heart beating fast or irregularly, talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12074506\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ventricular tachycardia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on what caused the ventricular tachycardia. Possible treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control the speed or rhythm of your heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment called &quot;cardioversion&quot; that involves applying a mild electrical current to the heart. This will help fix its rhythm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called an &quot;implantable cardioverter defibrillator&quot; (&quot;ICD&quot; for short) that the doctor can put in your body. The ICD uses mild electrical currents to help make your heart rhythm normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called a pacemaker that the doctor can put in your body. The pacemaker sends electrical signals to your heart to control your heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments called &quot;ablation.&quot; Ablation treatments use heat (called &quot;radiofrequency ablation&quot;) or cold (called &quot;cryoablation&quot;) to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending the abnormal electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to create scar tissue in the heart. This will block the flow of the abnormal electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12074521\"><span class=\"h1\">Can ventricular tachycardia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having heart disease can make it more likely you will have ventricular tachycardia. Doing things that keep your heart healthy can help prevent heart disease. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating a healthy diet. This involves eating lots of fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, but not a lot of meat or fatty foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking or doing a physical activity on most days of the week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12074536\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cardioversion (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
