These infections can strike at any time in life. Vaccines work by preparing the body to fight the germs that cause the infections.</p><p>Vaccines usually come in shots, but some come in nose sprays or medicines that children swallow. Vaccines are also called &quot;vaccinations&quot; or &quot;immunizations.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996914\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should my child get vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting vaccinated can help keep your child from getting sick. If your child does get sick, being vaccinated can keep him or her from getting severely ill. Plus, being vaccinated helps protect the people around your child from getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996921\"><span class=\"h1\">What vaccines do children age 7 to 18 get?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors recommend that children age 7 to 18 get vaccines to prevent the following infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza (flu) &ndash; The flu can cause fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, or sore throat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis &ndash; Vaccines to prevent these 3 different diseases are usually grouped together in 1 shot. Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Tetanus causes the muscles to work abnormally. Pertussis, also called &quot;whooping cough,&quot; can cause a severe cough.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) &ndash; HPV infection can lead to cervical cancer in women and cancer of the penis in men. It can also cause cancer of the mouth and throat, anal cancer, and genital warts in men and women. Both girls and boys should get the HPV vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningococcus &ndash; Meningococcus is a germ that can cause a serious body-wide infection of the blood or the tissues around the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcus &ndash; Pneumococcus is a germ that can cause infections of the lungs, ears, blood, or tissues around the brain. Most children age 7 to 18 do not need this vaccine. But children who have certain medical conditions might need it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis A &ndash; Hepatitis A does not usually cause problems in children, but it can cause severe liver disease in adults. Children who get the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis A vaccine</a> help prevent the adults around them from getting the infection. If your child never got this vaccine at a younger age, he or she might need to get it.</p><p/><p>Some children will need other vaccines, for example, if they missed a vaccine when they were younger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996928\"><span class=\"h1\">How many vaccine doses does my child need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each vaccine is different. Some vaccines work after just 1 dose. Others need 2 or more doses to prevent an infection. Vaccines usually take a few weeks to start working.</p><p>Some vaccines prevent an infection for the rest of your life. Others stop working well after some time. A &quot;booster&quot; is a vaccine dose given after a number of years. It reminds the body how to prevent an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996935\"><span class=\"h1\">At what ages will my child get vaccines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different vaccines are given at different ages. Most healthy children follow a set vaccine schedule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73404 \">table 1</a>). Even though doctors usually follow a set schedule, different children can get doses at different times. For example, many girls get the HPV vaccine at age 11 or 12. But they can get it any time from age 9 to 26.</p><p>Children might not follow the usual vaccine schedule if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have certain medical problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Started getting their vaccines later than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Started getting their vaccines on time, but then missed doses and fell behind schedule</p><p/><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will recommend a vaccine schedule that is right for your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996942\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can vaccines cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, vaccines cause no side effects. When they do cause side effects, they can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, mild swelling, or soreness where the shot was given</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or body aches</p><p/><p>Vaccines also sometimes cause more serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions. But serious side effects are rare.</p><p>Ask your child's doctor or nurse what side effects to expect each time your child gets a vaccine. If your child has a reaction or a problem after a vaccine, let the doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996949\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child has an egg allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has an egg allergy, let the doctor or nurse know. Some vaccines have egg in them because of how they are made. The doctor or nurse will tell you which vaccines are safe to get.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996956\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I keep track of my child's vaccines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to keep a list of the vaccines your child gets and when he or she gets them. Many schools and camps need this information before they let a child in. You can keep the list up to date by bringing it to your child's check-ups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482996963\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whooping-cough-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whooping cough (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
