The last part of that tube is the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). The colon sometimes has small pouches in its walls. These pouches are called &quot;diverticula.&quot; Many people who have these pouches have no symptoms. Diverticulitis happens when these pouches develop a small tear also known as a &quot;microperforation,&quot; which then become infected and cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479166657\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of diverticulitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom of diverticulitis is pain, which is usually in the lower part of the belly. Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479166664\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for diverticulitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are a few tests your doctor or nurse can do to find out if you have diverticulitis. But tests are not always needed. Your doctor or nurse might be able to diagnose you without them. If you do have a test, you might have a:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CT scan</strong> &ndash; A CT scan is a kind of imaging test. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abdominal ultrasound</strong> &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of your intestines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479166671\"><span class=\"h1\">How is diverticulitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on how bad your symptoms are. If you have mild symptoms, your doctor or nurse will put you on antibiotics and might put you on a clear liquid diet for a short time. That might be all the treatment you need.</p><p>But if you have severe symptoms, or if you get a fever, you might need to stay in the hospital. There, you can get fluids and antibiotics through a thin tube that goes into your vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; That way you can stop eating and drinking until you get better.</p><p>If you have a serious infection, the doctor might put a tube into your belly to drain the infection. In very bad cases, people need surgery to remove the part of the colon that is affected.</p><p>A few months after your infection has been treated, your doctor might recommend that you have a procedure called a colonoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>). During a colonoscopy, the doctor can look directly inside your colon to get an idea of the number of diverticula in your colon and to find out where they are. At the same time, he or she can check for signs of cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8835913\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I change my diet if I have had diverticulitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have had diverticulitis, it's a good idea to eat a lot of fiber. Good sources of fiber include fruits, oats, beans, peas, and green leafy vegetables. If you do not already eat fiber-rich foods, wait until after your symptoms get better to start.</p><p>You do <strong>not</strong> need to avoid seeds, nuts, popcorn, or other similar foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479166678\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomach-ache-and-stomach-upset-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diverticular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diverticular disease (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
