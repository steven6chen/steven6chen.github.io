After cystectomy, urine needs to be redirected with a urinary diversion and reconstruction procedure.</p><p>Ureterosigmoidostomy, which relied upon the anal sphincter for continence, was the first widely used surgical technique of urinary diversion. Its usefulness, however, was limited by deterioration of renal function over time, metabolic complications, and the development of secondary sigmoid colon cancers. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Newer urinary diversion techniques, including continent cutaneous diversions and internal reservoirs connected to the native urethra, have improved quality of life and patient acceptance by permitting volitional voiding. Earlier patient acceptance of radical cystectomy in the natural history of bladder cancer may ultimately improve the outcome of bladder cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>This topic discusses the three reconstructive options most widely used after cystectomy, ileal conduit, continent cutaneous diversion, and orthotopic neobladder.

The ideal characteristics of a urinary reservoir are listed in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54033\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54033 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Urinary conduits and reservoirs are typically constructed from an isolated segment of bowel. In theory, any segment of bowel can be used to form a urinary diversion. However, there are metabolic consequences to using each bowel segment, determined by its absorptive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/5-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-21</a>]. While most metabolic abnormalities are clinically subtle, they may assume significance in patients with renal insufficiency and in adolescents and young adults who will be subjected to the metabolic abnormalities for a prolonged period. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional and metabolic abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>The most commonly used bowel segments in urinary diversions include the distal ileum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cecum and the ascending or sigmoid colon; these sites are associated with the fewest metabolic consequences. </p><p>The primary indications for the use of various bowel segments and the associated metabolic consequences and symptomatology are shown in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63267\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63267 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/19,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22-25</a>]. In addition, the length and location of the segment used can affect the patient's postoperative bowel function. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2488817604\"><span class=\"h2\">Reconstructive techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary diversion procedures following cystectomy fall into two general categories: incontinent diversions and continent reconstructions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incontinent urine diversion simply directs urine from the ureters through a segment of isolated bowel to the surface of the abdominal wall via a cutaneous stoma. There, urine drains continuously and is collected by an external appliance adhered to the skin surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The most common type of incontinent urinary diversion is an ileal conduit. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Ileal conduits'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, continent reservoirs collect and store urine internally and empty stored urine intermittently by catheterization via a cutaneous stoma or volitional voiding. The patient is thereby freed from the need for an external appliance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A continent cutaneous diversion creates a low-pressure reservoir from a bowel segment and connects it to the skin via a continent channel. The patient empties the urine by self-catheterizing the continent channel. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Continent cutaneous diversions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, an orthotopic neobladder connects the bowel segment to the intact urethra. This procedure allows the patient to void volitionally through the urethra, restoring a more natural voiding pattern. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Orthotopic neobladders'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The process of selecting a particular urinary diversion option is complex and will be presented after each procedure has been described in detail. Factors that should be considered include oncologic (cancer stage and location, urethral margin), surgical (available bowel segment, pelvic radiation, surgeon experience), and patient-related factors (comorbidity, lifestyle, quality of life expectations) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75096\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75096 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Procedural selection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ILEAL CONDUITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ileal conduits were the gold standard for urinary reconstruction before the advent of continent diversions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Due to the relative ease of their formation and the shorter operative time, ileal conduits are often used in patients with significant medical comorbidities to minimize postoperative complications and the risk of reoperation. Ileal conduits remain the procedures of choice for many patients, especially those with a shorter life expectancy and those who cannot complete the necessary rehabilitation process to learn how to manage a continent diversion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H672038564\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques of ileal conduit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ileal conduit serves as a method for urine to drain to the exterior. A segment of ileum is selected; the terminal 10 to 15 cm of ileum at the ileocecal junction is typically preserved to maintain adequate absorption of bile salts, vitamin B12, and fat-soluble vitamins. The isolated segment of ileum is exteriorized through the abdominal wall as a stoma, around which an appliance is secured to collect urine. The presence of the stoma and appliance can affect a patient's body image. </p><p>Patients with obesity may require a loop-type (Turnbull) stoma because a short bowel mesentery and thick abdominal wall may prevent the creation of an end-on stoma without undue tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes of ileal conduit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ileal conduits have been used for decades since the first report in 1950 by Bricker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and therefore detailed information is available regarding the incidence of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/27,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30</a>]. Despite the fact that ileal conduits are often performed for patients with significant medical comorbidities, the complication rates are comparable to those of continent diversions performed for generally healthier patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63297\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63297 \">table 4</a>). </p><p>The outcomes of ileal conduits are best illustrated by a series of 412 patients followed for a median of 98 months; the frequency of complications ranged from 45 percent at five years to 94 percent at greater than 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The overall rate of complications associated with conduits is similar for ileum and colon segments among properly selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/27,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31,32</a>]. The most frequent complications are renal insufficiency, stomal problems, bowel problems, urinary tract infections, ureteral obstruction, and urinary calculi (in 27, 24, 24, 24, 14, and 9 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Parastomal hernias are another frequent complication after ileal conduit diversion. The incidence varies widely from 12 to 48 percent, depending on the definition used, the length of follow-up, and whether the diagnosis is made clinically or radiographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/30,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33,34</a>]. Factors that increase the risk for developing a parastomal hernia include female gender, obesity, low preoperative albumin, and prior abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Approximately 40 percent of patients with clinically apparent parastomal hernias report symptoms, such as difficulties with the ostomy appliance (poor fit, leakage), pain, and incarceration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parastomal-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parastomal hernia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion#H21063053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical ostomy for fecal diversion&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic mesh'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTINENT CUTANEOUS DIVERSIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All continent cutaneous reservoirs rely upon a low-pressure pouch constructed of various detubularized bowel segments and a functional mechanism that connects the reservoir to the skin designed to prevent involuntary urine flow. The most obvious advantage of this type of diversion is the ability to avoid continuous urine drainage with the need for an external appliance. These continent cutaneous diversions require lifelong intermittent clean self-catheterization through the stoma both to empty the reservoir and to irrigate mucous. </p><p>Patient education, motivation, and manual dexterity are required to manage the stoma and perform the necessary self-catheterization successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although continent cutaneous diversions have been largely supplanted by the orthotopic neobladder, this procedure is used when avoidance of an external appliance is desired but the urethra or bladder neck is nonfunctional or involved by tumor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362477147\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques of continent cutaneous diversions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many technical variations exist based upon the type of valve mechanism constructed and the segment of intestine utilized. Examples include the Kock, Indiana, and Miami pouches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. The Kock pouch has fallen out of favor due to the technical complexity of constructing the continent nipple valve and a high rate of complications often requiring reoperation. The Indiana and Miami pouches rely on a tapered ileal segment and plicated ileocecal valve to maintain continence.</p><p>Using the in situ appendix as the continence mechanism and catheterizable limb has improved outcomes and lowered major complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and it is a pouch design that can be performed in previously radiated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p>Another modification uses a tubularized segment of terminal ileum as a ureteral substitute to allow a more proximal ureteroenteric anastomosis and avoid the use of distal ureteral segments that may have been within the fields of radiation. The length of the ileal limb can be tailored to achieve a tension-free anastomosis with the proximal left ureter in the retroperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes of continent cutaneous diversions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of studies have demonstrated the safety and functional benefits of continent cutaneous diversions, with daytime and nighttime continence rates reported in the range of 90 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>However, complication rates can be significant. As an example, among 112 patients receiving a modified Indiana pouch at a single institution, 90 percent experienced one or more complications at 41 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Incontinence (any leakage) was the most common complication (28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The reported rates of incontinence vary significantly depending upon the criteria used to define incontinence and the length of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/29,32,44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32,44-47</a>]. </p><p>Incontinence with a continent cutaneous diversion can be due to uninhibited pouch contractions, poor pouch compliance, or an incompetent continence mechanism. Pouch urodynamics are helpful in categorizing the cause of the incontinence.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a poorly compliant, high-pressure reservoir, an initial trial of anticholinergics is the preferred approach. Refractory cases usually benefit from augmenting the reservoir with a patch of bowel to decrease pressure and increase capacity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incompetent continence mechanisms usually require open revision, although minimally invasive approaches, such as injecting bulking agents, are often helpful for mild incontinence.</p><p/><p>Other frequent and troublesome long-term complications involve the efferent limb and catheterizable stoma. The reported rate of stomal stenosis and difficulty in catheterizing the stoma is 4 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/44,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,47</a>]. Additional problems include stone formation within the pouch and urinary tract infections, which are observed in up to 20 percent of patients. Twenty-one percent required a reoperation, mostly for stomal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ORTHOTOPIC NEOBLADDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthotopic neobladders are internal reservoirs connected to the native urethra that rely upon the external striated sphincter and a high-capacity, low-pressure reservoir for continence. Because this approach facilitates the restoration of normal self-image by approximating normal voiding, orthotopic neobladders have become the procedure of choice for many patients requiring reconstruction following cystectomy for bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques of orthotopic neobladders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neobladder reservoirs are constructed from a segment of detubularized intestine (usually ileum) and anastomosed to the native urethra. </p><p>Some neobladders (eg, the hemi-Kock) incorporate an antireflux mechanism to limit backflow of urine from the reservoir to the upper urinary tracts. Although this mechanism mimics the normal antireflux apparatus of the native bladder, its requirement is controversial, and most urologists do not perform this mechanism: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proponents cite the detrimental upper tract changes seen in patients who are followed for 10 years or longer after ileal conduits or ureterosigmoidostomy, both of which are associated with free reflux of infected urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opponents question the need for specific antireflux maneuvers for the following reasons:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Long-term complications of reflux with orthotopic neobladders have been predominantly seen in patients who have high-pressure reservoirs. Contemporary neobladder designs ensure low filling pressures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Voiding pressures within orthotopic neobladders are generated via the Valsalva maneuver and exerted to all of the intra-abdominal contents, including the ureters and renal pelvis. This equal pressure distribution minimizes reflux during voiding. In addition, some neobladder designs (eg, the Studer reservoir) utilize a long isoperistaltic proximal limb, which provides resistance to retrograde flow, thereby providing additional antireflux protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Long-term follow-up of patients with neobladders that do not incorporate an antireflux design have confirmed that reflux-related complications are rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ureteral anastomoses that are designed to prevent reflux may lead to a greater risk of complications (eg, ureteroenteric stricture, ischemic fibrosis of the antireflux valve, stone formation from staples used to construct the valve system), which contribute substantially to morbidities, including impaired renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. </p><p/><p>Orthotopic neobladders were initially limited to men. In women, urethra-sparing orthotopic substitution was thought to be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence and voiding dysfunction. With improved understanding of the female rhabdoid sphincteric (continence) mechanism, however, this approach has become technically feasible and oncologically safe in selected women as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The selection criteria for orthotopic neobladders are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H118415313\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Minimally invasive approaches for radical cystectomy are being adopted at some centers, and there is increasing interest in performing intracorporeal urinary diversions for these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Several reports have demonstrated that when performed by experienced surgeons and in carefully selected patients, the oncologic and functional outcomes of minimally invasive urinary diversion are similar to those achieved with open approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Surgeons must maintain strict adherence to oncologic principles as the techniques of minimally invasive intracorporeal diversion are refined, and outcomes should be critically analyzed before widespread adoption of the approach.

Attention to neobladder design, careful surgical technique, appropriate patient selection, and patient education all contribute to optimizing functional results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/29,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2071839973\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary continence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally speaking, continence continues to improve over the first year after surgery as the capacity and compliance of the neobladder increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].

However, many patients still require nighttime protection, as there is no communication between the contractions in the reservoir and the urinary sphincter, due to loss of afferent input from the detrusor to the central nervous system, and no corresponding increase in urethra resistance during filling.

Thus, clinicians must first determine if a patient is a candidate for each diversion option and counsel the patient on all options for which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is eligible. Only then should an option be selected based upon the patient's values and preferences. Multiple factors need to be considered when choosing the appropriate procedure for an individual patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient and his or her family should have realistic expectations about the outcome associated with each reconstruction option. They also need to understand the efforts that will be required on their part during the rehabilitation process. In addition, patients need to have sufficient manual dexterity to master self-catheterization if the decision is made to proceed with a continent diversion. Women in particular who desire a neobladder need to have manual dexterity given the risk of urinary retention. In addition to the physician, the enterostomal nurse specialist can be invaluable in educating the patient and family and assisting with the decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced age can complicate both the procedure and the rehabilitation process. However, physiologic age is more relevant, and no formal cutoff should be applied. Older patients need to be aware that recovery of continence may take longer than in younger patients.

Our policy is to offer orthotopic neobladder and continent cutaneous diversion to older patients if they are healthy and motivated enough to care for the diversion. If an older patient subsequently becomes unable to care for the continent diversion, then an indwelling Foley catheter may be placed into the diversion, similar to what might be done for the native bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity increases the technical difficulty of cystectomy and may complicate orthotopic neobladder construction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. However, the postoperative management of an ileal loop conduit or a continent reservoir is also more difficult in patients with obesity, and most surgeons do not consider obesity to be a contraindication to reconstruction with an orthotopic neobladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Many, including the authors, feel that reconstruction to the urethra may be the least complicated reconstructive option for patients with obesity.

Ileal conduit, continent cutaneous diversion, and orthotopic neobladder are the three most commonly used techniques of urinary diversion. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Reconstructive options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ileal conduits are the archetypical procedure of incontinent urinary diversions. Urine is directed from the ureters through a segment of isolated bowel to the surface of the abdominal wall via a cutaneous stoma. There, urine drains continuously and is collected by an external appliance adhered to the skin surface. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Ileal conduits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continent cutaneous diversions create a low-pressure reservoir from a bowel segment and connect it to the skin via a continent channel. The patient empties the urine by self-catheterizing the continent channel. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Continent cutaneous diversions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Orthotopic neobladders connect a bowel segment to the intact urethra. This procedure allows the patient to void volitionally through the urethra, restoring a relatively more natural voiding pattern. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Orthotopic neobladders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who require urinary diversion following cystectomy, we suggest an orthotopic neobladder (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An orthotopic neobladder obviates the need for an external stoma and preserves the patient's body image without compromising cancer surgery. The patient needs to have sufficient bowel segment length, adequate renal and hepatic reserve, no tumor involvement at the urethral margin or intractable urethral stricture, and the ability to self-catheterize if necessary. (See <a href=\"#H118415313\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A continent cutaneous diversion may still offer substantial advantages over an incontinent ileal conduit for patients who desire to avoid a stomal appliance but are not candidates for an orthotopic neobladder due to tumor involvement of the urinary outflow tract or who do not desire an orthotopic neobladder. Patients seeking continent cutaneous diversions should be willing and able to self-catheterize and have sufficient bowel segment length and adequate renal and hepatic function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An ileal conduit is used for the remaining patients who are candidates for neither option of continent diversion. There is no contraindication to an ileal conduit in patients who can tolerate a cystectomy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative pathologic assessment of the distal urethral margin is recommended at the time of surgery (frozen section) before proceeding with an orthotopic neobladder. Patients should be informed that intraoperative findings may dictate a change in the planned form of urinary diversion.
