Early diagnosis and prompt treatment to restore euvolemia can be lifesaving.</p><p>True volume depletion may occur when sodium-containing fluids are lost in the urine, from the gastrointestinal tract or skin, or by acute sequestration into an internal &quot;third-space&quot; that results in a&nbsp;diminished intravascular volume.</p><p>When these fluid losses occur, two factors serve to protect against the development of hypovolemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary sodium and water intake are generally far above basal needs. As a result, relatively large losses must occur unless intake is concomitantly reduced (as with anorexia or vomiting).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The kidney minimizes urinary losses by enhancing sodium and water reabsorption.</p><p/><p>This topic will review the etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion. The treatment of this disorder is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume depletion results from loss of sodium and water from the following anatomic sites:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal losses, including vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, and external drainage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal losses, including the effects of diuretics, osmotic diuresis, salt-wasting nephropathies, and hypoaldosteronism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin losses, including sweat, burns, and other dermatological conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third-space sequestration, including intestinal obstruction, crush injury, fracture, and acute pancreatitis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each day, approximately 3 to 6 liters of fluid are secreted by the stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, and intestines into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Almost all of the secreted fluid is reabsorbed, so that only 100 to 200 mL are lost in the stool. However, volume depletion may ensue if the secreted fluid cannot be reabsorbed (as with external drainage and vomiting) or if secretion exceeds the capacity for reabsorption due either to increased&nbsp;secretion or reduced reabsorption. Acute bleeding from any site in the gastrointestinal tract is another common cause of volume depletion.</p><p><strong>Renal losses</strong> &mdash; Under normal conditions, renal sodium and water excretion are adjusted to match intake. In a normal adult, approximately 130 to 180 liters is filtered across the glomerular capillaries each day. More than 98 to 99 percent of the filtrate is then reabsorbed by the tubules, resulting in a urine output averaging 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span>. Thus, a small (1 to 2 percent) reduction in tubular reabsorption can lead to a 2- to 4-liter increase in sodium and water excretion, which, if not replaced, can result in severe volume depletion.</p><p>Diuretic therapy and osmotic diuresis caused by glucosuria are the most common causes of excessive renal salt and water loss. Variable degrees of sodium wasting are also present in many different renal diseases. As an example, most patients with chronic kidney disease and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> are unable to maximally conserve sodium if acutely placed on a low-sodium diet. These patients may have an obligatory sodium loss of 10 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day,</span> in contrast to normal subjects who can lower sodium excretion to less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This degree of sodium wasting is usually not important, since normal sodium balance is maintained as long as the patient is on a regular diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Salt-wasting nephropathy: Not usually a cause of polyuria'</a>.)</p><p>Rare patients may have a severe salt-wasting nephropathy with obligatory urinary losses that may exceed 100 mEq of sodium and 2 liters of water per day. Such patients develop hypovolemia unless a high sodium intake is maintained. Severe salt-wasting nephropathy is most often seen in tubular and interstitial diseases, such as autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (medullary cystic kidney disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although sweat production is low in the basal state, it can exceed 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/h</span> in a subject exercising in a hot, dry climate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The skin also acts as a barrier that prevents the loss of interstitial fluid to the external environment. When this barrier is interrupted by burns or exudative skin lesions, a large volume of fluid can be lost.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sequestration into a third-space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume depletion can be produced by the loss of interstitial and intravascular fluid into a third-space that is not in equilibrium with the extracellular fluid. As an example, a patient with a fractured hip may lose 1500 to 2000 mL of blood into the tissues adjacent to the fracture. Although this fluid will be resorbed back into the extracellular fluid over a period of days to weeks, the acute reduction in blood volume, if not replaced, can lead to severe volume depletion. Other examples of third-space fluid losses include intestinal obstruction, severe pancreatitis, crush injuries, bleeding (as with trauma or a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm), peritonitis, and obstruction of a major venous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypovolemic patients may present with a variety of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory abnormalities. Symptoms may be related to the volume depletion itself, such as lassitude and postural dizziness, or to the underlying cause of volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or polyuria. The physical examination may reveal decreased skin turgor, low arterial blood pressure or postural hypotension, and reduced jugular venous pressure. Patients with hypovolemia may present with a variety of laboratory abnormalities, including an elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hypernatremia or hyponatremia, hyperkalemia or hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis or metabolic acidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three sets of symptoms may occur in hypovolemic patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those due to volume depletion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those related to the cause of fluid loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those due to the electrolyte and acid-base disorders that can accompany volume depletion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms related to volume depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms induced by hypovolemia are primarily related to decreased tissue perfusion. The earliest complaints include lassitude, easy fatigability, thirst, muscle cramps, and postural dizziness. More severe fluid loss can lead to abdominal pain, chest pain, or lethargy and confusion due to ischemia of the mesenteric, coronary, or cerebral vascular beds, respectively. These symptoms are usually reversible, although tissue necrosis may develop if the low-flow state is allowed to persist.</p><p>Patients may also report decreased urine volume or frequency. Low urine volume (oliguria) is common in hypovolemic patients due to the combination of sodium and water avidity. If, however, concentrating ability is impaired, or if there is increased urea excretion due to catabolism, oliguria may not be present.</p><p>Symptomatic hypovolemia most often occurs in patients with isosmotic sodium and water depletion in whom most of the fluid deficit comes from the extracellular fluid. This contrasts with pure water loss due to insensible losses or diabetes insipidus, in which the elevation in the plasma osmolality (and sodium concentration) causes water to move down an osmotic gradient from the cells into the extracellular fluid. The net result of pure water loss is that approximately two-thirds of the water lost comes from the intracellular fluid, a condition which is called &quot;dehydration&quot; rather than &quot;hypovolemia.&quot; Patients with pure water losses exhibit the symptoms of hypernatremia (produced by the water deficit) before those of marked extracellular fluid depletion.

These symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria, a severe skin burn, or, in the case of sequestration into a third-space, pain associated with the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms related to electrolyte abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of electrolyte and acid-base disorders may also occur in hypovolemic patients, depending upon the composition of the fluid that is lost. The more serious symptoms and associated abnormalities include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness due to hypokalemia or hyperkalemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-muscle-weakness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with muscle weakness&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyuria and polydipsia due to severe hypokalemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H3819925\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Renal abnormalities'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachypnea due to acidosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular irritability and confusion due to metabolic alkalosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lethargy, confusion, seizures, and coma due to hyponatremia or hypernatremia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>An additional symptom that occurs only in primary adrenal insufficiency is extreme salt craving. Patients with this disease frequently give a history of heavily salting all foods (including those not usually salted) and even of eating salt that they have sprinkled on their hands. The mechanism responsible for this appropriate increase in salt intake is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although relatively insensitive and nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], certain findings on physical examination may suggest volume depletion. A decrease in the interstitial volume can be detected by the examination of the skin and mucous membranes, while a decrease in the plasma volume can lead to reductions in the systemic blood pressure and the venous pressure in the jugular veins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin and mucous membranes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the skin on the thigh, calf, or forearm is pinched in normal subjects, it will immediately return to its normally flat state when the pinch is released. This elastic property, called turgor, is partially dependent upon the interstitial volume of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Interstitial fluid loss leads to diminished skin turgor, and the skin flattens more slowly after the pinch is released. In younger patients, the presence of decreased skin turgor is a reliable indicator of volume depletion. By comparison, elasticity diminishes with age, so that reduced skin turgor does not necessarily reflect hypovolemia in older patients (more than 55 to 60 years old). In these patients, skin elasticity is usually best preserved on the inner aspect of the thighs and the skin overlying the sternum. Decreased turgor at these sites is suggestive of volume depletion. (See below.)</p><p>Although reduced skin turgor is an important clinical finding, normal turgor does not exclude the presence of hypovolemia. This is particularly true with mild volume deficits, in young patients whose skin is very elastic, and in obese patients, since fat deposits under the skin prevent the changes in subcutaneous turgor from being appreciated.</p><p>The skin is also usually dry in hypovolemic patients, and a dry axilla is particularly suggestive of the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The tongue and oral mucosa may also be dry since salivary secretions are commonly decreased in this setting.</p><p>Examination of the skin may be helpful in the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency. The impaired release of cortisol leads to hypersecretion of ACTH, which can result in increased pigmentation of the skin, especially in the palmar creases and buccal mucosa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial blood pressure changes from near normal with mild hypovolemia to low in the upright position and then, with progressive volume depletion, to persistently low regardless of posture. Postural hypotension leading to dizziness may be the patient's major complaint and is strongly suggestive of hypovolemia in the absence of an autonomic neuropathy or the use of sympatholytic drugs for hypertension.</p><p>An important change that can occur with marked fluid loss is that the secondary neurohumoral vasoconstriction leads to decreased intensity of both the Korotkoff sounds (when the blood pressure is being measured with a sphygmomanometer) and the radial pulse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. As a result, a very low blood pressure suggested by auscultation or palpation may actually be associated with a near-normal pressure when measured directly by an intraarterial catheter.</p><p>It should be noted that the definition of normal blood pressure in this setting is dependent upon the patient's usual value. Although <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;120/80</span> mmHg is considered &quot;normal,&quot; it is actually low in a hypertensive patient whose blood pressure is commonly <span class=\"nowrap\">180/100</span> mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Jugular venous pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reduction in the vascular volume observed with hypovolemia occurs primarily in the venous circulation (which normally contains 70 percent of the blood volume), thereby leading to a decrease in venous pressure. In most patients, the venous pressure can be estimated with sufficient accuracy by physical examination. The height of the jugular venous pulse above the right atrium (5 cm above the sternal angle of Louis) approximates the atrial pressure. However, characterization of the venous pressure as either low (less than or equal to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>0) or high (greater than or equal to10 cm H<sub>2</sub>0) is probably as precise an estimate as can be achieved.</p><p>Theoretically, the internal jugular vein would provide a more accurate reflection of right atrial pressure than the external jugular vein because of its larger diameter, less tortuous course, and absence of valves. However, many clinicians find that pulsations of the external jugular vein are more easily seen, and inspection of this venous pulse alone has been shown to correlate with direct measurements made by a central venous catheter positioned in the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypovolemic patients can have a variety of abnormal results of routinely performed laboratory tests. In addition to suggesting the presence of volume depletion, these changes may provide important clues to the etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Low urine volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the urine volume is typically, but not always, low (oliguria) in hypovolemic patients due to the combination of sodium and water avidity. If, however, concentrating ability is impaired, or if urea excretion is high, oliguria may not be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevation of the BUN and serum creatinine concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most circumstances, the BUN and serum creatinine concentration vary inversely with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increasing as the GFR falls. Serial measurements of these parameters can be used to assess the course of renal disease. However, an elevation in the BUN can also be produced by an increase in the rate of urea production or tubular reabsorption. As a result, the serum creatinine concentration is a more reliable estimate of the GFR since it is produced at a relatively constant rate by skeletal muscle and is not reabsorbed by the renal tubules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In normal subjects and those with uncomplicated renal disease, the <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/serum</span> creatinine ratio is approximately 10:1. However, this value may be substantially elevated in hypovolemic states because of the associated increase in urea reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In general, approximately 40 to 50 percent of filtered urea is reabsorbed, much of this occurring in the proximal tubule, where it is passively linked to the reabsorption of sodium and water. Thus, the increase in proximal sodium reabsorption in volume depletion produces a parallel increase in urea reabsorption. The net effect is a fall in urea excretion and elevations in the BUN and the <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/serum</span> creatinine ratio, frequently to greater than 20:1. This selective rise in the BUN is called prerenal azotemia. The serum creatinine concentration will increase in this setting only if the degree of hypovolemia is severe enough to lower the GFR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although an elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/serum</span> creatinine may indicate hypovolemia, it is subject to misinterpretation for two major reasons: 1) the BUN is affected by the rate of urea production; a high ratio may be due solely to increased urea production (as with steroid therapy) rather than hypovolemia, whereas a normal ratio may occur in patients with hypovolemia if urea production is reduced (eg, due to decreased protein intake); 2) the serum creatinine is affected by muscle mass as well as GFR; a high ratio may be due to a low muscle mass (which lowers the serum creatinine concentration), increasing the <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/serum</span> creatinine ratio in the absence of hypovolemia.</p><p>A special case is the increased <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/serum</span> creatinine ratio in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In such patients, the ratio increases markedly for two reasons: the extracellular fluid volume is decreased due to the blood loss, which increases proximal tubule urea reabsorption; and the rate of urea production is increased due to the catabolism and absorption of blood proteins from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypernatremia and hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors can influence the serum sodium concentration in hypovolemic states, and it is the interplay between them that determines the level observed in a given patient. Primary water loss, as in insensible losses or diabetes insipidus, results in hypernatremia. On the other hand, salt and water loss may be associated with hyponatremia. Volume depletion stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which will tend to cause retention of ingested water. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either hypokalemia or hyperkalemia can occur in hypovolemic patients. The former is much more common because of potassium loss from the gastrointestinal tract or in the urine. However, there may be an inability to excrete the dietary potassium load in the urine because of renal failure, hypoaldosteronism, or volume depletion itself since the delivery of sodium and water to the potassium secretory site in the cortical collecting tubule will be reduced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic alkalosis and acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of fluid loss on acid-base balance also is variable. Although many patients maintain a normal extracellular pH, either metabolic alkalosis or metabolic acidosis can occur. Patients with vomiting or nasogastric suction or those given diuretics tend to develop metabolic alkalosis because of hydrogen ion loss and volume contraction. On the other hand, bicarbonate loss (due to diarrhea or intestinal fistulas) can lead to metabolic acidosis. In addition, lactic acidosis can occur in shock and ketoacidosis in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematocrit and serum albumin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since red blood cells and albumin are essentially limited to the vascular space, a reduction in the plasma volume due to volume depletion tends to elevate both the hematocrit (ie, relative polycythemia) and serum albumin concentration. However, these changes are frequently absent because of underlying hypoalbuminemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anemia, due, for example, to bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Manifestations of shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms and physical findings that have been described apply to patients with mild to moderate volume depletion who are still able to maintain an adequate level of tissue perfusion. However, as the degree of hypovolemia becomes more severe, due, for example, to the loss of 30 percent of the blood volume from a ruptured aortic aneurysm, there is a marked reduction in tissue perfusion, resulting in a clinical syndrome referred to as hypovolemic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. This syndrome is associated with a marked increase in sympathetic activity and is characterized by tachycardia, cold, clammy extremities, cyanosis, a low urine output (usually less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/h),</span> and agitation and confusion due to reduced cerebral blood flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Manifestations in older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike in younger individuals, excessive fluid loss in older individuals often presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms. The most specific for hypovolemia is acute weight loss; however, obtaining an accurate weight over time may be difficult in older adults. Weight loss is particularly important to identify because older adults, compared with the young, have a greater proportion of fat (relative to lean) muscle mass. Since there is less water in fat than in muscle, older individuals have a lower total body water (relative to weight) and therefore, for a given degree of fluid loss, will have a greater reduction in extracellular fluid volume.</p><p>Many clinical signs and symptoms that would suggest volume depletion in a younger individual may be unreliable in older adults. Postural hypotension, for example, is not uncommon in euvolemic older adult patients as a result of sympathetic dysfunction and poor physical conditioning. In addition, a dry tongue and mouth, muscle weakness, confusion, speech difficulty, and sunken eyes can occur in older adults for many reasons other than volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Based upon the type of fluid lost and clinical setting, the older adult patient may have a normal, low, or high serum sodium concentration.

Such elements of the history may be absent in these patients because of confusion or cognitive issues.</p><p>An additional problem is the frequent inability to detect relative hypovolemia in patients with underlying edematous disorders or renal failure. Although clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory abnormalities may suggest relative volume depletion in some cases, others may require empiric fluid replacement therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravascular monitoring to reverse the consequences of hypovolemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H780669\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine sodium concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low urine sodium concentration (or low urine chloride concentration in patients who have metabolic alkalosis) is <strong>strongly suggestive</strong> of reduced tissue perfusion, and it is usually present in hypovolemic patients unless there is a salt-wasting state (eg, diuretics, underlying renal disease), selective renal ischemia (eg, acute glomerulonephritis or bilateral renal artery stenosis), or a very low-sodium diet.</p><p>However, the presence of a low urine sodium does not necessarily mean that the patient has true volume depletion, since edematous patients with heart failure, cirrhosis with ascites, and the nephrotic syndrome also avidly conserve sodium. These disorders are characterized by reduced effective arterial blood volume due to a primary reduction in cardiac output (heart failure), to splanchnic vasodilatation and sequestration of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and arterial shunts (cirrhosis), and to a low plasma oncotic pressure (in some patients with severe or acute nephrotic syndrome).</p><p>The response of the kidney to true volume depletion and reduced effective arterial blood volume is to conserve sodium and water in an attempt to expand the extracellular volume. With the exception of those disorders in which sodium reabsorption is impaired, the urine sodium concentration in hypovolemic states should be less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and may be as low as 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. There are two additional exceptions in which the urine sodium concentration may be higher than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> despite the presence of hypovolemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When there is also a high rate of water reabsorption; in this setting, the rate of sodium excretion and urine volume are low, but the urine sodium concentration is higher than expected due to concentration of the urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When sodium is excreted with another anion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This most often occurs in metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting or nasogastric suction. In such disorders, the metabolic alkalosis is associated with a high filtered bicarbonate load. The stimuli that increase renal sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption (volume depletion and hypokalemia) may sometimes be inadequate to remove all of the filtered sodium and bicarbonate from the urine. Under these conditions, urinary bicarbonate excretion occurs (with sodium as the accompanying cation). This occurs early in the disorder and also intermittently during established alkalosis, usually when transient further increases in serum bicarbonate occur (disequilibration phases of metabolic alkalosis). In such settings, the urine chloride concentration remains low (ie, below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and is a better index of extracellular fluid volume.

The FENa directly evaluates sodium handling and, in contrast to the urine sodium concentration, is not affected by changes in urine volume.

In this setting, the FENa is usually under 1 percent in hypovolemic patients and above 1 percent when the oliguria is due to acute tubule necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. By comparison, this measurement is more difficult to evaluate in patients with a normal GFR since the filtered sodium load is so high in this setting that a different value (FENa &lt;0.1 to 0.2 percent) must be used to diagnose volume depletion.

This response may not be seen, however, if concentrating ability is impaired by renal disease, an osmotic diuresis, the administration of diuretics, or central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. As an example, both severe volume depletion (which impairs urea accumulation in the renal medulla) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and hypokalemia (which induces antidiuretic hormone [ADH] resistance) can limit the increase in the urine osmolality in some patients. Thus, a high urine osmolality is consistent with hypovolemia, but a relatively isosmotic value does not exclude the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Urinary concentration can also be assessed by measuring the specific gravity. The results are less reliable than the urine osmolality because specific gravity is determined by the mass rather than<strong> </strong>number of solute particles in the urine. A value above 1.015 is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of a concentrated urine, as is usually seen with hypovolemia. The urine specific gravity is misleadingly high with proteinuria or after administration of radiocontrast agents.

Although an estimate of central venous pressure can help determine a patient's volume status, the central venous pressure does <strong>not</strong> adequately predict whether or not an intravenous fluid challenge will increase stroke volume and cardiac index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>There are two major clinical settings in which the central venous or right atrial pressure provides an unreliable estimate of the LVEDP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with pure left-sided heart failure, the wedge pressure is increased, but the central venous pressure may remain unchanged if right ventricular function is normal.

Such patients may require a cautious therapeutic trial of saline infusion or placement of a pulmonary artery catheter for optimal fluid management.

However, decreased renal perfusion in this setting can also be induced by concurrent volume losses, including gastrointestinal losses, bleeding, or overly aggressive diuretic therapy.
