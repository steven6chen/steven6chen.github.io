In selecting a contraceptive method, individuals weigh factors such as efficacy, access, prevention of sexually transmitted infections, side effects, convenience, and noncontraceptive benefits. Contraceptive counseling provides education, dispels misinformation, facilitates selection of a method that will be successful for the individual, and encourages patient involvement in healthcare decisions and life goals. Discussing contraception brings the clinician and patient together to create a tailored care plan that meets the individual's reproductive needs over a lifetime.</p><p>This topic will review factors influencing contraceptive selection, guide the clinician through the selection process, review issues that impact compliance, and provide information on special populations.

The former refers to the pregnancy rate among those who use the method correctly on every occasion (ie, inherent effectiveness as demonstrated in a carefully monitored clinical trial); actual effectiveness is usually lower due to inconsistent or incorrect use. Actual effectiveness is also influenced by frequency of intercourse, age, and regularity of menstrual cycles, as pregnancy is less likely in women who are older, have infrequent sexual intercourse, and have irregular menstrual cycles. Explanations for the apparent failure of other contraceptive methods when used by the typical patient include inconsistent adherence to method requirements, incorrect use, gaps in use, discontinuation of the method, as well as failure of the method itself.</p><p>The effectiveness categories above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>) are more clinically useful for informing patients about contraceptive effectiveness than the Pearl Index, which is typically reported in clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The Pearl Index is defined as the number of unintended pregnancies per 100 women per year (ie, the number of pregnancies in 1200 observed months of use). One problem with this index is that it does not account for the fact that contraceptive failure rates typically decline with continued use; therefore, a Pearl Index determined by a study of new and short-term users of a method will likely be higher than in a study of long-term users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The contraceptive selection process may involve a guardian as well as the patient. Data to guide the decision-making process are often lacking, and the benefits, risks, side effects, and consequences of an unintended pregnancy must be balanced against one another. As an example, the magnitude of thrombotic risk from estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives in women with limited mobility (eg, patient in wheelchair) is not known. However, hormonal contraceptives can be desirable for these women because they reduce menstrual frequency or flow in addition to preventing pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional challenges can include the patient's limited capacity (intellectual, physical, or both) to use a method, problems with menstrual hygiene, and inability to undergo an office-based examination or procedure. Some women with intellectual disabilities cannot tolerate pelvic examinations, making pelvic examination or placement of an IUD in an office setting unrealistic. For women with spinal cord injuries above the T6 level, a pelvic examination can trigger autonomic dysreflexia, an abnormal autonomic system response that can cause a rapid and potentially life-threatening rise in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

While breast and pelvic exams, cervical cancer screening, and screening for sexually transmitted diseases are important, most groups agree that these procedures are not necessary before a first or renewed prescription for hormonal contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

Some groups recommend documentation of weight or body mass index when initially prescribing hormonal contraceptives to monitor changes over time and counsel women who might incorrectly assume that weight gain is associated with their contraceptive method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1259342336\"><span class=\"h2\">Exclude pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy can be reasonably excluded in women who meet any of the criteria in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567 \">table 8</a>). For women who do not meet any of these criteria, a pregnancy test can be performed, but should be obtained two or more weeks after the woman's last episode of unprotected intercourse to exclude the possibility of a preimplantation pregnancy.

Nearly one-half of all unintended pregnancies occur among women using contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and 90 percent of these pregnancies are estimated to result from incorrect or inconsistent method use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. External factors that influence continuation rates include cost, insurance coverage, copayments and deductibles, and insurance requirements for monthly refills (as opposed to dispensing a year-long supply) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Among women attempting to avoid pregnancy, the percentage who continue to use a method for one year is approximately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD): 88 to 93 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Copper-releasing IUD: 85 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etonogestrel implant</a>: 83 to 84 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ring or patch or pill: 50 to 67 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depo-Provera: 56 to 58 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragm: 57 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fertility awareness-based methods: 47 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male condom: 43 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female condom: 41 percent</p><p/><p>Based on the above data, an alternate solution to improve compliance is to counsel women on switching to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC: contraceptive implant or IUD) when appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. In a study of over 9000 United States women ages 14 to 45 years of age using a LARC method, the one-year discontinuation rates were 12 percent for the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, 15 percent for the copper IUD, and 17 percent for the contraceptive implant, all of which were significantly lower than the hormonal contraception discontinuation rates (range 42 to 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The higher continuation rates appear to reflect higher satisfaction rates with these methods but could also be due partly to the need to see a clinician to discontinue and the higher upfront costs. (See <a href=\"#H3061967225\" class=\"local\">'Role of long-acting contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p>While observational studies tend to report contraception counseling increases use and continuation of contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>], data from randomized trials are limited. In a 2013 systematic review of five trials that assessed the impact of direct counseling on adherence to and continuation of hormonal contraception, three trials reported a benefit from enhanced counseling compared with routine care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Trial limitations included small sample sizes, high loss to follow up, and differing interventions. A cluster randomized trial performed in 40 reproductive health clinics across the United States reported that more women received LARC counseling and more women selected LARC methods at sites that received evidence-based training than the control sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The optimal strategies for contraception counseling remain unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/14,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4085548339\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among users of hormonal contraception, forgetting or mistiming doses is common and plays a factor in unintended pregnancy. Studies suggest that reminder systems for hormonal contraceptive methods, such as smartphone apps or alarms, could be helpful in improving compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-67</a>]. For women who miss a contraceptive pill or mistime a patch, ring, or injection, either partner can use a condom to enhance pregnancy protection as well as protect against sexually transmitted infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male condoms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-condoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female condoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14509521\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinician strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A report by the Guttmacher Institute recommended that clinicians provide ongoing support for contraceptive use by regularly assessing the woman's sexual activity, relationship status, attitude about pregnancy, and life events such as changes in partners, job, school, housing, personal crises, and loss of health insurance coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In addition, clinicians can educate women about the use, potential challenges, noncontraceptive benefits, and possible side effects of the selected method, which might lower the rate of discontinuation. In the 2002 United States National Survey of Family Growth study of over 6700 women using reversible contraception, 46 percent of women reported discontinuing at least one method because they were dissatisfied with it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Two-thirds of women who discontinued hormonal methods did so because of side effects, while almost 40 percent of those who discontinued the condom did so because of partner dissatisfaction.</p><p>Additionally, clinicians can improve contraceptive initiation and compliance by reducing unnecessary medical barriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Examples of removing barriers include using quick-start or same-day start methods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56863\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56863 \">algorithm 1</a>), eliminating office visits for contraception renewal or switch, eliminating pelvic exams prior to beginning hormonal contraception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89825 \">table 7</a>), and prescribing a one-year supply of hormonal contraceptives, and supporting over-the-counter access of oral contraceptive pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/41,43,69-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43,69-73</a>]. However, barriers persist. In a 2015 United States survey study of over 2000 sexually active adult women who did not desire pregnancy, nearly 30 percent of the women who had ever tried to get a prescription for hormonal contraception reported access barriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The most commonly cited barriers were cost (14 percent), challenges obtaining an appointment (13 percent), the clinician requiring an examination or Pap smear (13 percent), not having a regular doctor or clinic (10 percent), difficulty accessing a pharmacy (4 percent), and other (4 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H403415745\"><span class=\"h2\">System strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Public health strategies to improve the uptake and continuation of contraceptive methods have included improved education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>], training for providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>], and funding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Conversely, programs that reduce public funding for contraception are associated with reduced contraceptive use and an increased pregnancy rate. After Texas defunded Planned Parenthood affiliates in 2013, there was an estimated 35 percent reduction in claims for long-acting reversible contraception and an estimated 31 percent reduction in claims for injectable contraception in counties with Planned Parenthood sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. During the same time period, the counties with Planned Parenthood affiliates reported a 1.9 percentage point higher rate of childbirth covered by Medicaid, which represented a relative increase of 27 percent from baseline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3492582181\"><span class=\"h1\">EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency contraception (EC) is intended for occasional or back-up use and not as a primary contraceptive method.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

(See <a href=\"#H3819435495\" class=\"local\">'Goals of contraception counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women are encouraged to select one of the most effective contraceptive options. In practice, contraceptive methods can be divided into three categories based upon their theoretical and actual effectiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1700351184\" class=\"local\">'Contraceptive efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most effective methods are long-acting reversible contraception (LARC: intrauterine contraception and contraceptive implants) and sterilization. These methods are associated with the lowest pregnancy rates regardless of the population studied because their effectiveness is minimally influenced by the patient's actions or adherence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1700351184\" class=\"local\">'Contraceptive efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For women who desire reversible contraception, we prefer LARC. Pregnancy rates are comparable to sterilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>), with the highest satisfaction and continuation rates. (See <a href=\"#H1700351184\" class=\"local\">'Contraceptive efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For women who request sterilization, we counsel about LARC as well because LARC is comparable to sterilization in terms of effectiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>), but is nonsurgical and reversible. For couples who desire permanent contraception (sterilization), we prefer vasectomy of the male partner. Vasectomy is as effective, but less morbid and costly than tubal occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H1700351184\" class=\"local\">'Contraceptive efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Effective contraceptive methods include combined estrogen-progesterone hormonal methods (pills, patch, vaginal ring), progestin injections, and diaphragms. These methods are less effective than long-acting reversible contraception, although still highly effective when used properly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1700351184\" class=\"local\">'Contraceptive efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The least effective methods of contraception, including male and female condoms, cervical caps, sponges, spermicides, periodic abstinence, and withdrawal, are associated with actual pregnancy rates that are much higher than perfect use rates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1700351184\" class=\"local\">'Contraceptive efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of a contraceptive method must take into account the woman's preferences, her time frame for pregnancy, and contraceptive efficacy, safety, and side effects. We ask the woman if she will be able to adhere to the requirements of using the method, adhere to the method despite these requirements, and likely tolerate the method's potential side effects. The noncontraceptive benefits of the various birth control options can help guide the selection process. (See <a href=\"#H12170197\" class=\"local\">'Method selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2330940067\" class=\"local\">'Noncontraceptive benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to any method of contraception, we recommend use of condoms for individuals at risk of sexually transmitted infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1139156226\" class=\"local\">'Protection from sexually transmitted infections'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=male-condoms#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Male condoms&quot;, section on 'Protection from STIs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-condoms#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female condoms&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women are informed about emergency contraception in case of contraceptive failure, which can include incorrect use or non-use. (See <a href=\"#H3492582181\" class=\"local\">'Emergency contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For healthy women, most contraceptives can be started on the same day as the visit and require minimal examination or testing prior to initiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89825 \">table 7</a>). Pregnancy can be reasonably excluded in women who meet any of the criteria in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67567\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67567 \">table 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1719160796\" class=\"local\">'Starting contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unique contraceptive needs exist in adolescents, patients with medical issues or disabilities, and patients with cancer. (See <a href=\"#H132372867\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H227271416\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Mimi Zieman, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraceptive-counseling-and-selection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women.
