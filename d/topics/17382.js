The rate decreased to 500,000 in 1979 and to 380,000 in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Approximately 130,000 of the tonsillectomies performed in 1996 were for individuals over 15 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The literature regarding indications for tonsillectomy is largely focused on children. The extent to which pediatric data can be reliably extrapolated to older patients is unclear.</p><p>This topic will review indications for performing tonsillectomy in adults. Tonsillectomy procedural techniques and complications in adults, evaluation of the adult with pharyngitis, treatment and prevention of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, and tonsillectomy in children are discussed separately.

The lymphoid contents are covered by respiratory epithelium that can invaginate and cause crypts. The common term &quot;tonsils&quot; refers specifically to the palatine tonsils. Waldeyer's ring, a ring of lymphoid tissue in the pharynx, is formed by the palatine tonsils as well as the pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids), tubal tonsils, and lingual tonsils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F101787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101787 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72358\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72358 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Tonsillar crypts can harbor bacteria. Solidified &quot;plugs&quot; may form within the crypts and are termed tonsilloliths (&quot;tonsil stones&quot;). These often have a foul smell and can contribute to bad breath. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bad-breath#H1477192449\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bad breath&quot;, section on 'Oral'</a>.)</p><p>Tonsil size is based on a grading scale between 0 and 4:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; Tonsils absent or atrophied</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1+ &ndash; Tonsils fill 0 to 25 percent of the oropharyngeal diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2+ &ndash; Tonsils fill 25 to 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3+ &ndash; Tonsils fill 50 to 75 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 4+ &ndash; Tonsils fill 75 to 100 percent</p><p/><p>&quot;Kissing tonsils&quot; fill 100 percent of the oropharyngeal diameter and touch each other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT AND CHRONIC PHARYNGOTONSILLITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent acute pharyngitis and chronic tonsillitis are the most common reasons for tonsillectomy in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a retrospective study of 361 tonsillectomy procedures performed in adults in one United States institution between 2001 and 2007, chronic or recurrent infection accounted for 57 percent of tonsillectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>If the tonsils are affected primarily, then the infection is tonsillitis. If the oropharynx is affected primarily, then it is called pharyngitis. If both are affected, then pharyngotonsillitis is the correct term. In practice, the terms tonsillitis and pharyngitis are often used interchangeably because of the difficulty in distinguishing clinically between them.</p><p>Most episodes of acute pharyngitis are caused by viral infection and are benign and self-limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. There are also bacterial, as well as non-infectious, causes of pharyngitis. Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection in adults accounts for approximately 10 percent of cases of pharyngitis. The evaluation of acute pharyngitis, possible causes of recurrent acute pharyngitis, and its treatment are discussed separately. Recurrent cultures positive for GAS infection can represent repeated infection, a carrier state, inadequate treatment, or treatment failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pharyngitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pharyngitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis#H3972918375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of streptococcal pharyngitis&quot;, section on 'Persistent or recurrent symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Chronic tonsillitis refers to the presence of infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation of the oropharynx or tonsils for at least three months. Patients with chronic tonsillitis or pharyngitis often have sore throats that get better during antibiotic treatment, but symptoms recur as soon as the antibiotic is discontinued. The cause of chronic tonsillitis is likely multifactorial. Causes of chronic tonsillar inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infection include various viruses (eg, Epstein-Barr virus), bacteria, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and possibly allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Respiratory viruses (eg, adenovirus) are highly prevalent in the adenoid and palatine tonsils of patients with chronic tonsillar diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Persistence of these viruses in tonsils may stimulate chronic inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical variants'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-adenovirus-infection#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection&quot;, section on 'Pharyngitis and coryza'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the throat pain and days lost from work, recurrent acute infections from GAS place patients at risk for both suppurative and nonsuppurative (eg, acute rheumatic fever) GAS complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-streptococcal-tonsillopharyngitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602492648\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized controlled trials in children with recurrent throat infections who are severely affected have shown that tonsillectomy is effective in reducing the overall number and severity of subsequent episodes of throat infection, for up to two, possibly three, years. Major complications occur in approximately 3 percent of cases. These results, however, might not be generalizable to adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications#H3046050\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in children: Indications and contraindications&quot;, section on 'Severely affected children'</a>.)</p><p>In adults, evidence, largely from observational studies, suggests that some adults with recurrent or chronic pharyngitis may benefit from tonsillectomy. Two small randomized trials have demonstrated that tonsillectomy can reduce the incidence of recurrent pharyngitis. However, the brief follow-up periods in both trials preclude firm conclusions about the true benefit of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of 86 adult patients with recurrent pharyngitis, fewer patients in the tonsillectomy group had an episode of pharyngitis compared with the control group after five months of follow-up (39 versus 80 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Entry criteria consisted of three or more episodes of pharyngitis in the past year; the episodes had to interfere with functioning and cause the patient to see a doctor, and the palatine tonsils had to be involved. The most common morbidity of tonsillectomy was postoperative throat pain for a mean of 17&plusmn;6 days. Of the 46 adults who had tonsillectomy, only one was hospitalized for postoperative pain and two had postoperative hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another randomized trial of tonsillectomy for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, 70 adults (mean age 26 years) were assigned to immediate surgery or placement on a waiting list for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Entry criteria were three or more episodes of typical acute pharyngitis in six months or four episodes in 12 months, at least one of which was associated with a positive culture or rapid test for GAS infection. During a 90-day follow-up period, pharyngitis recurred in 24 percent of the controls and in 3 percent of the tonsillectomy group. The number needed to undergo tonsillectomy to prevent one recurrence was five (95% CI 3-16). In addition, the time to first pharyngitis episode was significantly shorter and severity of symptoms was higher in the control than in the tonsillectomy group. The most common morbidity related to tonsillectomy was postoperative throat pain for a mean of 13&plusmn;4 days. Minor postoperative bleeding occurred in two of the adults who had tonsillectomy. No serious adverse effects resulted from tonsillectomy.</p><p/><p>Observational studies have suggested a benefit of tonsillectomy in adults with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. In a prospective study of 72 adults with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis who had tonsillectomy, patients showed improvements in disease-specific measures and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Benefits included fewer episodes of sore throat, improved quality of life, and fewer missed work days. In all of the studies, the lack of a control group (patients with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis who did not undergo surgery) raises concern about the reliability of the findings. Patient-reported history of recurrent infection may be unreliable, and follow-up was often incomplete or short-term.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with recurrent pharyngitis secondary to GAS do not require tonsillectomy. For adults who fit the Paradise criteria and whose quality of life is affected significantly by recurrent acute pharyngitis secondary to GAS, we suggest tonsillectomy. We favor a conservative approach by applying the Paradise criteria, although they were not developed for adults, for referring patients for tonsillectomy: three episodes yearly for &ge; three years; five episodes yearly for two years; or seven episodes in one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Each episode of pharyngitis should be clearly documented with one or more of the following clinical features: temperature &gt;38.3&deg;C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A streptococcal (GAS) infection, before considering tonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Our criteria for tonsillectomy consideration are in agreement with the guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) for indications for tonsillectomy in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommend that tonsillectomy not be performed for the sole indication of reducing the frequency of GAS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. They do note that tonsillectomy may be considered in the rare patient with recurrent symptoms of GAS pharyngitis that do not diminish over time and for which there is no alternative explanation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401619279\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER POSSIBLE INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other indications for consideration of tonsillectomy include infectious causes such as recurrent peritonsillar abscess, suspected malignancy, obstructive sleep apnea, or, in rare cases, halitosis caused by cryptic tonsils and tonsilloliths (tonsil stones).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2086558\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2086876\"><span class=\"h3\">Peritonsillar abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We refer patients for consideration of tonsillectomy if they have had a second episode of peritonsillar abscess (PTA) or a first episode of PTA preceded by three episodes of acute tonsillitis in the previous year. This is based on data that recurrent PTA is more likely if two or three episodes of acute tonsillitis have preceded the occurrence of PTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/4,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22</a>]. There are no prospective controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy with close monitoring for preventing recurrent PTA. Tonsillectomy may also be required during acute treatment of PTA if there is significant upper airway obstruction or failure to adequately drain the abscess at the bedside. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritonsillar-cellulitis-and-abscess#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritonsillar cellulitis and abscess&quot;, section on 'Tonsillectomy'</a>.)</p><p>PTA is a bacterial, often polymicrobial, infection in the space between the tonsil and pharyngeal constrictor muscle. It occurs more frequently in young adults than in children. It is typically treated with antibiotic therapy and drainage (incision or aspiration). The recurrence rate for PTA is reported between 10 and 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2087243\"><span class=\"h3\">Streptococcal carrier state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tonsillectomy is not indicated for the streptococcal carrier state.</p><p>Streptococcus carriers are unlikely to spread the organism to close contacts and are at very low risk for developing suppurative complications or acute rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Management of tonsillitis related to infectious mononucleosis involves symptomatic care with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Corticosteroids are not routinely used but may be needed if there is risk of airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Tonsillar crypt stones (tonsilloliths) are a rare cause of halitosis, occurring in about 3 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-in-adults-indications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
