This is particularly relevant for the aging population, where fragility fractures, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and low bone mineral density (BMD) are more prevalent. There are multiple reasons why this differentiation is important, not the least of which is that management of osteoporosis differs vastly from treatment of other bone diseases in patients with CKD.</p><p>This topic will review the diagnosis and evaluation of osteoporosis in patients with CKD.

These changes, including phosphorus retention, secondary hyperparathyroidism, chronic acid loads, elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), or sclerostin overproduction, may contribute independently or collectively to the increased fracture risk that is seen in GFR stages G3 to G5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/2,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18-21</a>].

Although GFR (usually eGFR) was measured in some of the nine population studies used to construct the FRAX model, the sample size was not statistically powerful enough to validate the independent contribution of reduced GFR on fracture risk. In a subsequent study, FRAX was able to predict fracture in patients with CKD, the majority of whom had CKD stages G3a and G3b [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In clinical practice, FRAX may be applied to patients with CKD. Just as one may need to incorporate falls or frequency of falls (which were also not captured in FRAX) into a clinical judgment when utilizing FRAX, the clinician should also consider adjusting the absolute fracture risk to a higher level in patients with eGFR stages G3b to G5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/8,9,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H836136\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone mineral density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with CKD, eGFR &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute,</span> and risk factors for fracture, BMD (DXA) testing may be used to assess fracture risk.

In one study, for every standard deviation decrease in lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and ultradistal radius BMD by DXA, there was a significant increase in the risk of fracture (odds ratios [ORs] 1.93, 1.65, 1.86, and 2.29, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dialysis dependent</strong> &ndash; BMD is also lower in dialysis-dependent patients who fracture, as illustrated by the findings of a meta-analysis of six cross-sectional studies, which included 683 patients on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

DXA measures areal BMD, rather than volumetric BMD. In addition, it cannot distinguish between cortical and cancellous bone, and it cannot assess bone microarchitecture or bone turnover. Thus, new technologies (high resolution microcomputed tomography [microCT] and micromagnetic resonance imaging [microMRI], hip structural analysis, finite element analysis) have been developed that allow noninvasive, three-dimensional evaluation of bone microarchitecture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'New and emerging technologies'</a>).

Many studies have demonstrated that low BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at any skeletal site (spine, hip, or forearm) can predict osteoporotic (fragility) fracture.

Furthermore, osteoporosis frequently coexists with CKD-MBD.

Similar diagnostic threshold values for men are less well defined, although for any given BMD, the age-adjusted fracture risk is similar in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>None of these populations specifically included individuals with CKD.

In patients with more severe CKD, hypercalcemia may signal the possibility of adynamic bone disease. However, other causes of hypercalcemia (eg, hyperparathyroidism, multiple myeloma) should be considered (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to hypercalcemia&quot;</a>). The rise in plasma calcium in patients with adynamic bone disease is due, in part, to a marked reduction in the bone uptake of calcium after a calcium load (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> to treat hyperphosphatemia).</p><p>25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is a common finding in predialysis patients with CKD and is associated with elevated PTH levels, which may worsen the manifestations of secondary hyperparathyroidism in this setting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-resistance#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of vitamin D deficiency and resistance&quot;, section on 'Chronic renal disease'</a>). Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), the most active metabolite of vitamin D, is principally synthesized in the kidney. Circulating calcitriol levels begin to fall when the GFR is less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> and are typically markedly reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In addition to the loss of functioning renal mass, calcitriol production is also reduced by phosphate retention and elevated levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2671336\"><span class=\"h3\">Parathyroid hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTH levels are used as a surrogate to identify the extremes of bone turnover.

A PTH level of &lt;103.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> best discriminated low from non-low turnover. However, the discriminatory ability of a single level to predict bone turnover was suboptimal (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] &lt;0.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Nevertheless, in the absence of bone biopsy, PTH levels are the best available parameter to identify the extremes of bone turnover. The ability of serum PTH to predict adynamic bone disease is predicated on the basis that the PTH synthesis is not being blunted by any pharmacologic agent (eg, vitamin D analogues, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a>).</p><p>KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) suggests using PTH trends rather than absolute targets to guide treatment decisions, although this strategy has not been tested specifically for distinguish osteoporosis from other elements of CKD-MBD, including renal osteodystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/27,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,54</a>].</p><p>An important consideration in interpreting PTH levels in CKD is not to assume that an elevated PTH in a patient with CKD means that the increased PTH is due only to CKD. It is important to have a broad perspective on other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73157 \">table 5</a>) such that the finding of an elevated PTH and a reduced eGFR does not automatically imply that the two are linked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Many conditions associated with osteoporosis may have correctable causes of elevated PTH levels even when discovered at the same time as CKD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2671343\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although biochemical markers of bone turnover cannot be used to diagnose osteoporosis, these markers may provide support that one or another form of renal bone disease may be present, and they are valuable for assessing systemic rates of bone turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/59-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-64</a>]. In clinical practice, the marker that has the most value in discriminating bone turnover in CKD is BSAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/53,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,65</a>]. In particular, a high BSAP may be helpful in excluding the presence of adynamic bone disease. In a cross-sectional study evaluating the ability of serum BSAP to predict bone turnover in 492 dialysis patients who had bone histomorphometric assessment of bone turnover, a BSAP level of &lt;33.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">Unit/L</span> (in an assay with reference range 11.6 to 42.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">Unit/L)</span> best discriminated low from non-low bone turnover (AUROC 0.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Thus, in this assay, a serum BSAP above 33.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">Unit/L</span> probably excludes adynamic bone disease. A BSAP of &gt;42.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">Unit/L</span> best discriminated high from non-high bone turnover (AUROC 0.71). The combination of intact PTH and BSAP was slightly better able to discriminate bone turnover than BSAP alone.</p><p>The BSAP threshold that best discriminates low bone turnover (adynamic bone disease) will vary with the assay employed. However, a serum BSAP above the upper limit of the laboratory reference range is rarely, if ever, seen in patients with adynamic bone disease unless there has been a recent fracture. Bone cellular activity is reduced in adynamic bone disease, and BSAP is derived from osteoblast activity. While an elevated BSAP provides biochemical evidence that adynamic bone disease is unlikely, the cause of the elevated BSAP requires further evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87761\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87761 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>Other markers of bone turnover used in the assessment and management of osteoporosis are not useful in the assessment and management of CKD-MBD. That is because the preferred biochemical marker of bone resorption, serum C-telopeptide (CTX), and the preferred markers of bone formation, monomeric forms of serum propeptide type I collagen (PINP), are both cleared by the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/59,61,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61,63,64</a>]. The only available biochemical markers that are not cleared by the kidney are BSAP, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5b, an osteoclast cellular marker), and the trimer form of PINP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87760 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/61,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,66</a>].

Bone biopsy is particularly important in patients for whom a specific diagnosis of bone disease has significant management implications.
