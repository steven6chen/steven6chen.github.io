The use of surgery as definitive therapy for hyperthyroidism varies with the cause of the disease and the characteristics of the patient.</p><p>Indications for surgical management of hyperthyroidism and preoperative preparation are reviewed here. Thyroidectomy is reviewed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-thyroidectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial thyroidectomy&quot;</a>).

In the only randomized, prospective trial comparing these three therapies, each was equally effective in normalizing serum thyroid hormone concentrations within six weeks; after treatment, 95 percent or more of the patients were satisfied with their therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Therefore, the choice of therapy should involve active discussion between clinician and patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67833 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment#H1085652933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>A patient may prefer surgery over other modalities because of a desire to avoid radioiodine, avoid the potential side effects of antithyroid drugs, and to obtain rapid correction of hyperthyroidism. In addition, the following patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism may be better served by surgery:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with very large goiters (&ge;80 g) who may require multiple doses of radioiodine, which can result in asymmetric and limited shrinkage of the goiter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with goiters causing upper airway obstruction or severe dysphagia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who also have a nonfunctional thyroid nodule with indeterminate, suspicious, or positive cytology on fine needle aspiration, in whom surgery can both cure the hyperthyroidism and provide a definitive diagnosis of the nodule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with coexisting hyperparathyroidism who are surgical candidates for parathyroidectomy, in whom surgery can cure the hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate-to-severe Graves' ophthalmopathy in whom surgery is preferred over radioiodine since radioiodine may exacerbate Graves' ophthalmopathy. Coadministering corticosteroids with radioiodine may prevent exacerbation of ophthalmopathy when the ophthalmopathy is mild. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women who are allergic to antithyroid drugs and are tolerating hyperthyroidism poorly have no alternative to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have persistent hyperthyroidism despite treatment with antithyroid medication and radioiodine.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is used more commonly for the treatment of patients with a toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) than it is for Graves' hyperthyroidism. It is indicated for patients with obstructive goiters or very large goiters, those who need rapid and definitive correction of hyperthyroidism, and for patients with coexisting malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>Surgery could also be considered in children and adolescents and, as noted above, may be preferable in patients with coexistent nonfunctioning nodules, especially if the goiters are large. Surgery is increasingly preferred by patients who have nodules in order to avoid the need for future assessments and interventions. Nodular thyroid tissue that remains following radioiodine treatment may develop calcifications over time, which may be interpreted as suspicious by radiologists on subsequent imaging and lead to thyroidectomy a decade or more after radioiodine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Substernal extension of the goiter is another possible indication for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18841322\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of substantial comorbidity, including cardiopulmonary disease or other debilitating disease, is a relative contraindication to surgery. Surgery during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion or premature delivery. For pregnant women who require surgery because of an inability to tolerate thionamides, the risks of surgery are minimized by operating during the second trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment#H703132157\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Thionamide intolerance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6617679\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTENT OF RESECTION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Graves' disease</strong> &ndash; The extent of surgery for Graves' hyperthyroidism was an area of controversy that paralleled the arguments for low versus high doses of radioiodine therapy; more aggressive surgery (total thyroidectomy) had a higher likelihood of inducing hypothyroidism, while less aggressive surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy) had a higher likelihood of recurrent hyperthyroidism. Most experts now agree that total or near-total thyroidectomy is considered the optimal procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Surgical complications are lower when performed by surgeons with expertise in thyroid surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Total thyroidectomy involves removal of all thyroid tissue. Total thyroidectomy has a nearly 0 percent risk of recurrence; however, these patients require lifelong thyroxine (T4) replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subtotal thyroidectomy is defined as either bilateral subtotal (leaving posterior rim on each thyroid lobe) or as the Hartley-Dunhill procedure (unilateral total lobectomy with contralateral subtotal lobectomy). Up to 60 percent of patients can maintain adequate thyroid function without thyroid hormone supplementation when there is a four- to seven-gram remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], an important feature for patients without good access to thyroid hormone. However, the remnant predisposes to persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a randomized trial of subtotal versus total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease involving 191 patients followed over five years, recurrent hyperthyroidism occurred in 4.7 percent of patients after subtotal versus none after total thyroidectomy, while transient hypoparathyroidism was seen in 6.8 and 12.6 percent, respectively, and permanent hypoparathyroidism in none and 0.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxic multinodular goiter </strong>&ndash; For patients with toxic multinodular goiter (MNG), total thyroidectomy should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxic adenoma</strong> &ndash; For patients with toxic adenoma without evidence of nodules in the contralateral lobe, ipsilateral lobectomy (or isthmusectomy if the adenoma is in the thyroid isthmus) is adequate. For patients with toxic adenoma and a coexisting nonfunctioning nodule in the contralateral lobe, total thyroidectomy may be warranted. The decision should be based upon results of fine needle aspiration biopsy of the nonfunctioning nodule(s). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1595358367\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of hyperthyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hyperthyroidism are at risk for developing thyroid storm, a rare condition that usually occurs during surgery or in the first 18 hours after the procedure. Thus, patients with hyperthyroidism who are to undergo thyroid surgery should be treated with an antithyroid drug until they are euthyroid. Beta blockers can be used to control hyperthyroid symptoms until euthyroidism is achieved.</p><p>Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism may also be given inorganic iodine (eg, potassium iodide [SSKI], 50 mg iodide per drop [0.05 mL], 1 to 2 drops three times daily [approximately 300 mg daily]) for up to 10 days before surgery to decrease the vascularity of the thyroid gland and surgical blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Preoperative iodine is generally not used in patients with toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) or toxic adenoma, whose thyroid glands tend to be less hypervascular than in patients with Graves' disease, since iodine may actually exacerbate hyperthyroidism, especially in those patients not concurrently treated with antithyroid drugs preoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> 0.5 mg every six hours) have been used in conjunction with beta blockers and, in Graves' disease, iodine drops or iopanoic acid (if available) to prepare thyrotoxic patients for emergency surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10949243\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers ameliorate many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. They are often started as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before obtaining a 24-hour radioiodine uptake or scan or the results of a thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) level. In the absence of contraindications, we usually give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> which has the advantages of single daily dosing and beta-1 selectivity, but all drugs of this class effectively reduce symptoms in patients with hyperthyroidism.</p><p>In addition, for patients who are allergic to or cannot tolerate thionamides, beta blockers administered preoperatively may be as safe as a thionamide for preoperative preparation of the hyperthyroid patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. As an example, in a randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> in 30 patients with newly diagnosed and untreated hyperthyroidism undergoing thyroid surgery, there was no difference in anesthesiologic or cardiovascular complications during surgery or in postoperative complications postsurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Patients unable to take a thionamide drug'</a> below.)</p><p>Beta blockers may be tapered and discontinued after thyroid function tests have returned to normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Thionamide therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism associated with an elevated TRAb level or a normal or increased radioiodine uptake is established, thionamides should be initiated with the aim of controlling hyperthyroidism prior to surgery. Thionamides alone are sufficient to achieve euthyroidism in approximately three to eight weeks. Prior to initiating thionamides, we obtain baseline blood tests, including a complete blood count (white count with differential) and a liver profile (bilirubin and transaminases). We do not use thionamides in patients with a baseline absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 mm<sup>3</sup> or elevated liver transaminases (more than fivefold the upper limit of normal), except in selected patients after careful assessment of alternatives and risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methimazole</a> is recommended over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU), except during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of its longer duration of action (allowing for single daily dosing) and a lesser degree of toxicity.

For patients with larger goiters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more severe hyperthyroidism, we typically administer 20 or 30 mg daily. Patients should have their thyroid function assessed at four- to six-week intervals. The dose can be adjusted if the hyperthyroidism (as assessed clinically and by measurements of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], T4, and triiodothyronine [T3]) is not ameliorated within four to six weeks.

Longer acting drugs of this type, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, are preferable because an oral dose taken one hour before surgery will maintain adequate blockade until the patient is able to take oral medications postoperatively. Supplemental intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> can be administered as needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10949250\"><span class=\"h3\">Iodine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inorganic iodine rapidly (7 to 10 days) decreases thyroid secretion in addition to decreasing thyroid vascularity. Thus, in patients with Graves' disease, we administer inorganic iodine for up to 10 days before surgery to decrease the vascularity of the thyroid gland and surgical blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. Iodine can be given as saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI; 50 mg iodide per drop [0.05 mL], 1 to 2 drops three times daily [approximately 300 mg daily]) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-iodide-and-iodine-lugol-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium iodide-iodine solution</a> (Lugol's) 8 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">iodide/iodine</span> per drop, 5 to 7 drops three times daily.

Alternatively, the patient with Graves' disease can be given sodium ipodate or iopanoic acid, iodinated radiographic contrast agents, that not only contain iodine but also inhibit the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 and therefore rapidly lower serum T3 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Permanent hypoparathyroidism is uncommon, occurring in approximately 1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Monitoring for hypocalcemia after near-total or total thyroidectomy is necessary. Serum calcium and albumin should be measured on the evening of surgery and the next morning. Oral calcium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> supplementation should be administered based upon the results of the serum calcium corrected for albumin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59019\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59019 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Alternatively, and especially in patients whose risk of postoperative hypocalcemia is high, the routine postoperative supplementation of calcium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> may decrease the development of hypocalcemia symptoms and allow for earlier discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In many centers, a serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is checked in the immediate postoperative period and is used to predict risk of hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a meta-analysis of nine studies evaluating pre- and post-thyroidectomy serum PTH levels, the magnitude of the reduction in serum PTH was predictive of the development of postoperative hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients with a &gt;65 percent decline in PTH were at highest risk for postoperative hypocalcemia.

Thus, when the risk of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia is high (eg, if the surgery was difficult and the surgeon feels the parathyroids may have been compromised or if the intraoperative or postoperative PTH levels are less than 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> the routine supplementation of calcium and calcitriol is preferred. A typical prophylactic dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> is approximately 2 to 3 g of elemental calcium given in two to four divided doses daily. This can be tapered over two to six weeks depending upon hypocalcemic symptoms and serum calcium determinations. Calcitriol is initially administered at a dose of 0.5 mcg daily for one to two weeks and increased or decreased thereafter depending upon the calcium and intact PTH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

For patients with Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) who had near-total or total thyroidectomy, thyroid hormone replacement (T4) should be initiated prior to discharge in a euthyroid patient at a dose of approximately 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight daily. If the patient was still hyperthyroid at the time of surgery, thyroid hormone replacement should be delayed until levels fall into the normal range; the interval can be estimated based on the week-long half-life of T4. Older patients and those with coronary disease or multiple coronary risk factors should initially be treated with approximately 20 percent less than the full calculated replacement dose to avoid the potential complications of overtreatment.</p><p>Serum TSH should be measured approximately six weeks after discharge and the dose increased by 12 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> if the TSH remains above the normal reference range.

Patients with symptoms or signs of <span class=\"nowrap\">compression/obstruction,</span> a need for rapid return to euthyroidism, or coexisting thyroid cancer require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H18841177\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with Graves' disease, we suggest radioiodine therapy (in the absence of contraindications) as our first choice for definitive therapy of the hyperthyroidism, given its lower cost and lower complication rate than surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Primary antithyroid drug therapy is an alternative option especially for patients with mild Graves' disease and small goiters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment#H1085652933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter (MNG), we suggest treatment with either surgery or radioiodine rather than prolonged thionamide (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In addition, for patients with hyperthyroidism due to a very large goiter (&gt;80 g), we suggest surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of substantial comorbidity, including cardiopulmonary disease or other debilitating disease, is a relative contraindication to surgery. Surgery during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion or premature delivery. For pregnant women who require surgery because of an inability to tolerate thionamides, the risks of surgery are minimized by operating during the second trimester. (See <a href=\"#H18841322\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assuming there are no contraindications to its use,<strong> </strong>we recommend<strong> </strong>using a beta blocker for patients with moderate-to-severe hyperadrenergic symptoms until euthyroidism is achieved by thionamides or surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> 25 to 50 mg daily and increase the dose as needed (up to 200 mg daily) to reduce pulse to less than 90 beats per minute if blood pressure allows. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hyperthyroidism are at risk for developing thyroid storm, a rare condition that usually occurs during surgery or in the first 18 hours after the procedure. Thus, for patients with hyperthyroidism associated with an elevated thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) level or a normal or elevated radioiodine uptake who are to undergo thyroidectomy, we suggest treating with a thionamide until they are euthyroid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methimazole</a> is preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU), except during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of its longer duration of action (allowing for single daily dosing) and a lesser degree of toxicity. The initial dose of methimazole is 5 to 40 mg once daily. For patients with larger goiters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more severe hyperthyroidism, we typically administer 20 or 30 mg daily. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thionamides-in-the-treatment-of-graves-disease#H1078101806\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Choice of drug'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, we suggest adding potassium iodine solution to decrease the vascularity of the thyroid gland and surgical blood loss (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We typically use saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI, 50 mg iodide per drop [0.05 mL], 1 to 2 drops three times daily [approximately 300 mg daily]) for up to 10 days before surgery. Preoperative iodine is generally not used in patients with toxic MNG or toxic adenoma, whose thyroid glands tend to be less hypervascular than in patients with Graves' disease, since iodine may actually exacerbate hyperthyroidism especially in those patients not concurrently treated with antithyroid drugs preoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism#H5852546\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with toxic nodular goiter or toxic adenoma who are intolerant or unable to take thionamides should be pretreated with beta blockers alone, whereas patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism who are allergic to or are intolerant of thionamides can be treated with the combination of beta blockers and iodine. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Patients unable to take a thionamide drug'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent postoperative hypocalcemia, serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be assessed preoperatively and repleted if necessary. (See <a href=\"#H492850330\" class=\"local\">'Measures to prevent postoperative hypocalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the high risk of hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy, serum calcium concentration should be measured the evening and first morning after thyroidectomy. Treatment of postoperative hypocalcemia should be tailored to the severity and expected duration of parathyroid deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59019\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59019 \">table 2</a>). When the risk of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia is high (eg, if the surgery was difficult and the surgeon feels the parathyroids may have been compromised, or if the intraoperative or postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are less than 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> the patient is routinely supplemented with calcium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>.
