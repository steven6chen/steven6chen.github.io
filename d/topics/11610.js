In 2013, the incidence of prematurity in the United States was 57, 93, 96, and 100 percent for twins, triplets, quadruplets, and quintuplets, respectively.

However, it appears that the rate of growth after 30 weeks gestation of twins of uncomplicated pregnancies is slower than that of singleton fetuses. Fetal growth curves have been developed specifically for twins, but are of limited usefulness, since they were derived from small populations and did not consider chorionicity or outcome (see <a href=\"#H1151790301\" class=\"local\">'Chorionicity'</a> above). Thus, for twin pregnancies, singleton growth curves are generally used to evaluate fetal growth and to detect abnormal growth (eg, fetal growth restriction).

Using this definition, the distribution for twin births is 75 percent with &lt;15 percent discordance, 20 percent with 15 to 25 percent discordance (mild), and 5 percent with severe discordance (&gt;25 percent). For triplets and higher order multiple births, the same definition is the one most commonly used, but it does not account for the birth weight of the middle infant(s).

Both rates increase with the number of fetuses. Perinatal mortality refers to late fetal deaths plus neonatal deaths that occur within seven days of birth; the infant mortality rate (IMR) refers to deaths that occur within one year of birth.

In a systematic review of the literature, the reported increased risk of neuromotor impairment appeared to be partly due to the lower birth weight and gestational age of twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-complications-outcome-and-management-of-multiple-births/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. However, data were inconsistent and there also were limitations of the studies included in the review, such as failure to adequately control for confounding factors, and small number of patients. In contrast, there were no differences in the risk of cognitive impairment or autism for twins versus singletons.</p><p>In a subsequent publication from the Neonatal Research Network (NRN) of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight &le;1000 g) born between 1996 and 2005, logistic regression analysis showed that twin survivors compared with singletons were more likely to have neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months corrected age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.00&ndash;1.85]). [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-complications-outcome-and-management-of-multiple-births/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In this study, evaluation at 18 to 22 months corrected age consisted of neurologic, hearing, vision, and development (using Bayley Scales of Infant Development&ndash;II) assessments. Neurodevelopment impairment was defined as the presence of any of the following: cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness, bilateral hearing loss needing amplification, or a Bayley Mental or Psychomotor Developmental Index score less than 70.</p><p>One study reported an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in smaller twins with growth discordance &ge;20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-complications-outcome-and-management-of-multiple-births/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Additional risk factors for perinatal mortality and morbidity for survivors of multiple births include monoamniotic pregnancy (eg, cord entanglement), birth order, and fetal death during the late second or third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1151789284\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal complications and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prematurity is the most common neonatal complication of multiple births. The risk of prematurity and the incidence of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g) increases as fetal number increases. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Preterm birth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FGR is more common in multiple order than in singleton pregnancies. FGR is due primarily to either uterine crowding, or uteroplacental insufficiency. Selective or discordant growth restriction is more common in monochorionic multiple births, in which fetuses share a common placenta. Increasing discordance is associated with increasing mortality and morbidity (eg, twin-twin transfusion). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Fetal growth'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1151793740\" class=\"local\">'Twin-twin transfusion syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital anomalies are more common in multiple births primarily due to increased risk in monozygotic twins. Causes of congenital anomalies include early malformations, anomalies due to abnormal placental vascular anastomoses in monochorionic pregnancies (eg, acardiac twins), and deformations due to uterine crowding. (See <a href=\"#H1151792268\" class=\"local\">'Congenital anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal management includes being aware of the issues that occur more commonly at the birth of multiple infants. Prior to delivery, information from the obstetrical team should identify additional high risk factors that identify any anticipated needs of the infants including prematurity, evidence for FGR, and congenital anomalies. In the delivery room, there should be adequate staffing of skilled providers to provide care for each individual infant. The care of the infants is individualized depending on the presence of complications due to prematurity (eg, hypothermia, respiratory distress), FGR (hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and polycythemia), and twin-twin transfusion, and the presence of severe congenital anomalies. (See <a href=\"#H1151797325\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although challenging, mothers of twins and triplets can successfully breastfeed. Mothers who wish to breastfeed should be supported, and additional guidance should be given to optimize the feeding of her newborn infants in regards to milk production, timing, and positioning of infants. (See <a href=\"#H1151797367\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial support is needed to address the increased emotional stress, financial burden, and care issues that parents of multiple births experience. (See <a href=\"#H1151799214\" class=\"local\">'Family support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is unclear whether twins are at increased risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairment after adjusting for confounding factors. However, it appears that risk of cerebral palsy may be increased in survivors of multiple births, especially in those exposed to a fetal demise.
