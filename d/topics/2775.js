The nasal vestibule is separated anatomically from the nasal cavity by the limen nasi. Cancers originating from the nasal vestibule behave like squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and are distinct histological and clinical cancers compared with tumors arising from the nasal cavity. Thus, these tumors are considered separately for diagnosis and treatment. </p><p>The presentation and treatment of nasal vestibule cancers are discussed here. Cancers arising in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumors of the nasal cavity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paranasal-sinus-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paranasal sinus cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362246102\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy and pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nasal vestibule is a pear-shaped opening that functions as the entrance to the nasal cavity. Its borders are the nasal septum and columella medially, the lower lateral nasal cartilage laterally, and the premaxilla inferiorly. The vestibule terminates posteriorly at the limen nasi, the junction of the lower and upper lateral cartilages (scroll region), as well as the transition from skin to mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75148\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75148 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54865\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54865 \">figure 2</a>). The vestibule is lined by skin bearing hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands.</p><p>The majority of nasal vestibule cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that have a natural history similar to that of squamous cell skin cancer. Other types of skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma and melanoma can also arise in the nasal vestibule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362246088\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of nasal vestibule cancers has been estimated to be 0.32 per 100,000 in a Danish national registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The average age of patients with nasal vestibule cancer is between 60 and 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Nasal vestibule cancer is more common in men, who constitute 55 to 70 percent of cases. Risk factors include sun exposure and, potentially, smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362246095\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to their external location, tumors of the nasal vestibule are usually relatively limited at presentation and exhibit a more favorable prognosis than tumors of the nasal cavity. </p><p>Superficial ulcerations, or masses of the membranous septum or columella with crusting, scabbing, and occasional minor bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59174 \">picture 1</a>) are common presentations. More advanced lesions can perforate the septum or invade the alar cartilage and grow through the skin surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71971\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71971 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52010 \">picture 3</a>). There can also be extension inferiorly into the gingivolabial sulcus and premaxillary soft tissues. Growth into the posterior nasal cavity occurs late or with recurrences.</p><p>The nasal vestibule lymphatics drain primarily to the submandibular lymph nodes (level Ib). The facial lymph nodes are second-echelon nodes, which may become involved with recurrent disease. Only approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients have clinical lymph node involvement at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p>Biopsy is required for pathologic confirmation to establish the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluations should include physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scan to assess bone invasion or regional adenopathy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if there is suspicion of perineural spread or skull base invasion for very advanced tumors. </p><p>Three different staging systems are used to describe cancers arising in the nasal vestibule:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eighth (2017) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) includes cancers of the nasal vestibule (edge of naris to mucocutaneous junction) with those arising in the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110768 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With the exception of tumors that are very advanced or histologically more consistent with nasal cavity origin, we do not recommend using this staging system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paranasal-sinus-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paranasal sinus cancer&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and staging'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Wang staging system, which is the most specific to the nasal vestibule, divides cancers of the nasal vestibule into three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>T1</strong> &ndash; T1 lesions are relatively superficial and are limited to the nasal vestibule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>T2</strong> &ndash; T2 lesions extend from the nasal vestibule into adjacent structures such as the nasal septum, upper lip, or skin of the nose, but are not fixed to underlying bone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>T3</strong> &ndash; T3 lesions include those tumors with extension to the hard palate, buccogingival sulcus, upper nasal septum, turbinates, paranasal sinuses, or are fixed to deep muscle or bone.</p><p/><p>Several contemporary groups advocate the use of the Wang staging system rather than the TNM system for staging of the primary tumor because of its simplicity and better correlation with prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/2,3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of therapy is to achieve the best oncologic outcome with the least morbidity in terms of both cosmesis and nasal function. There are no large clinical trials that have established the optimal treatment for these patients; treatment recommendations are based upon observational data from single-institution case series. </p><p>For T1-2 tumors, primary treatment consists of either surgery or radiation therapy (RT), with either option carrying very high rates of disease control. The choice of modality depends upon the ability to achieve an optimal balance between eradicating the cancer, cosmesis, and nasal function. Surgical excision of very early lesions can be used to avoid long-term toxicity of RT (dry nose, nasal crusting, recurrent epistaxis, nasal stenosis); however, in many situations, surgery cannot be performed without significant morbidity. In patients with T3 disease, primary surgery with the addition of adjuvant RT, if indicated, is expected to result in higher disease control and is preferred compared with primary RT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362246339\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery of nasal structures consists of two parts: resection and reconstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713466219\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the extent of the cancer, resection may consist of wide local excision (WLE) or Mohs micrographic surgery. Deep structures, such as the upper and lower nasal cartilages, septal cartilage, and maxillary bone, may need to be resected. If negative margins cannot be realistically achieved without extensive morbidity, surgery should be avoided.</p><p>The goal of resection is complete tumor removal with microscopically tumor-free margins. It is critical for the surgeon to appreciate the complex functional and aesthetic anatomy of the nose since it is frequently possible to customize the cancer operation so that optimal reconstruction is feasible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1352540979\"><span class=\"h3\">Defect reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nose is the central aesthetic feature of the face; thus, meticulous reconstruction of any nasal defect is critical to minimize obvious disfigurement. Nasal reconstructions are typically performed by a fellowship-trained facial plastic or head and neck surgeon.</p><p>The nose is divided into subunits: root, dorsum, sidewall, ala, tip, soft tissue triangles, and columella. The units most affected by nasal vestibule cancers include the ala, tip, soft tissue triangles, and columella. </p><p>The nose is also considered in terms of three layers: external lining (skin), supportive structure (cartilage), and internal lining (mucosa). </p><p>Optimal nasal reconstruction requires an individualized reconstructive plan for each nasal subunit and each layer. Full-thickness defects require reconstruction of the intranasal lining, cartilaginous skeleton, and overlying skin. The internal lining can be reconstructed with skin grafts or mucosal <span class=\"nowrap\">flaps/grafts</span>. Supportive structures are reconstructed with cartilage grafts (eg, ear conchal cartilage, rib, nasal septum). The external lining can be reconstructed with secondary intention, skin grafts, local flaps (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">advancement/rotational</span> flaps, bilobed flaps), or regional pedicled flaps (eg, melolabial, paramedian forehead flaps) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Large defects extending into the lips, cheek, maxilla, or oral cavity may require free flaps for reconstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prosthetic devices. To achieve an optimal aesthetic outcome, multiple surgeries or revisions may be necessary in complex reconstructions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1500388990\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary RT may be delivered exclusively with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or a combination of EBRT and an interstitial brachytherapy implant. EBRT is most commonly delivered with photon beams and electron beams. The role of intensity-modulated RT or proton therapy is not clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Photon EBRT can be delivered either with opposed lateral fields using megavoltage photons or a single anterior portal using a 4:1 mix of high-energy electrons and megavoltage photons; a single en face electron beam can be used alone. The mixed electron-photon technique allows for some sparing of the skin in patients with disease limited to the mucosal surface. </p><p>For any of these techniques, a tissue-equivalent compensator is placed over the entire nose to convert the irregular nasal surface to a box-like contour to improve the dose distribution. The dose delivered to the initial EBRT fields is usually 50 gray (Gy) given in once-daily 2 Gy fractions. This is followed by a boost to the tumor of 20 to 25 Gy using either EBRT or interstitial brachytherapy. </p><p>When treating the regional lymph nodes electively, the regional lymphatics are treated to 45 to 50 Gy using conventional photon fields. In cases of positive adenopathy, patients may undergo neck dissection, followed by regional lymph node irradiation to 50 to 60 Gy or primary RT to 70 Gy. In cases when there is positive adenopathy in level Ib, we recommend elective irradiation of the facial lymph node using superficial electron beams. These are often referred to as the &quot;Fu Machu&quot; fields and are typically matched to the primary site with a 5 mm skin gap.</p><p>Acute side effects during RT are moderate desquamation of the skin of the nose and mucosa of the nasal and oral cavity. Following recovery from RT, most patients have permanent dryness and crusting of the nasal cavity that is best treated with saline washes and daily lubricant ointment. The risk of serious complications in the years after RT, such as cosmetic deformity or pain from tissue necrosis, is less than 5 percent.</p><p>Although interstitial implants of the nasal vestibule are individualized, the implant generally consists of two to four planes of needles inserted through the dorsum of the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78952 \">figure 3</a>). The source is typically low dose rate iridium-192. When given as a boost after EBRT, the dose delivered by the interstitial implant is usually 25 Gy. Very early T1 tumors can be treated with interstitial brachytherapy alone, usually 55 to 75 Gy, depending on the tumor size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Locally advanced lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More extensive tumors should be treated with a combination of surgery and RT, as these tumors have a low rate of local control with either modality alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When a combined modality approach is used, RT can be given either pre- or postoperatively. Preoperative RT offers the possibility of shrinking the tumor to allow for a less extensive resection, whereas postoperative RT results in less wound complications. The external beam RT dose is usually 50 to 60 Gy delivered in 2 Gy fractions.</p><p>Resection of advanced stage lesions may require total rhinectomy. The principles of reconstruction are similar to those of less advanced lesions and may require a free flap, titanium mesh, or multiple flaps. Often a simpler and more cosmetically pleasing alternative may be a nasal prosthesis. (See <a href=\"#H1352540979\" class=\"local\">'Defect reconstruction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of the neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of the literature analyzed the frequency of lymph node involvement in 20 case series that included over 1000 patients with cancer of the nasal vestibule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risk of lymph node metastasis at presentation is approximately 6 percent, and another 12 percent develop delayed lymph node metastases. </p><p>Patients who present with lymph node-positive disease should be treated with neck dissection at the time of surgery or RT. Lymph node levels included in the treatment should include levels I to III at minimum. The decision for elective contralateral neck treatment is based on whether the lesion encroaches or crosses the midline. Elective ipsilateral treatment is generally limited to patients with locally advanced lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">(T3/T4)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key factors influencing the long-term outcome after treatment are the extent of the local disease (T stage) and the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases. </p><p>The most extensive data using contemporary treatment techniques come from a series of 174 patients treated over a 10 year period at five centers in Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The five-year locoregional control rate was 69 percent in the 164 patients without regional lymph node involvement, but none of the 10 patients who had positive lymph nodes at presentation achieved five-year locoregional disease control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The five-year locoregional control rate for the 109 patients with T1 lesions according to the Wang system was 79 percent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 47 patients with T2 primary tumors, the five-year locoregional control rate was 54 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the 18 patients with T3 lesions, the five-year locoregional control rate was 35 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disease-specific survival decreased with increasing T stage according to the Wang classification (83, 63, and 39 percent for T1, T2, and T3 lesions, respectively).</p><p/><p>Additional information about prognosis comes from a single-institution series. This includes a series of 99 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule treated at the University of Florida with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy, EBRT and brachytherapy, or surgery and EBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this series, most T1-2 tumors were treated with radiation therapy. For the entire cohort, the 10-year rates of local control, locoregional control, and disease-specific survival were 82, 73, and 86 percent, respectively. The rate of local control following radiation therapy alone was 93 percent for T1-T2 lesions and 77 percent for T3-T4 lesions. In contrast, the local control rate for T3-T4 lesions treated with surgery and radiation therapy was 90 percent. </p><p>Other contemporary studies have reported local control rates for T1-2 tumors with radiation therapy ranging from 80 to 97 percent, with ultimate local controls of &gt;90 percent after surgical salvage for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-of-the-nasal-vestibule/abstract/6,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTTREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular posttreatment follow-up is an essential part of the care of patients after potentially curative treatment of head and neck cancer. For patients with nasal vestibule cancers, recurrences can often be salvaged successfully. Patients should be educated about possible signs and symptoms of tumor recurrence. Our approach in these patients is to perform a follow-up examination every two months for the first year, every three months in the second year, every six months during years two to five and then annually thereafter. Most patients can be followed adequately with clinical exam. Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is warranted if there is suspicion for recurrence with bone involvement or more thorough evaluation of regional lymphatics.
