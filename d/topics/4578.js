Most investigators use an increase in either plasma ACTH or plasma cortisol concentration as the criterion for response. Multiple blood samples must be obtained (at least one basal sample and at least two and as many as eight post-CRH samples). As a result, the test should probably be performed only by specialists in carefully selected patients. In the United States, ovine CRH is available and carries US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling for the differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

Blood samples for corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol are drawn 15 (or 5) and 0 minutes before and as often as 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after CRH injection. However, in Cushing's syndrome, if one measures only the plasma ACTH response, the samples at -5, -0, 15, and 30 minutes are sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and if one measures only the serum cortisol response, the samples at -15, 0, 45, and 60 minutes are sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Normally both hormones should be measured since the criteria for a positive response may include increases in either plasma ACTH or serum cortisol concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Synthetic ovine CRH is equipotent to human CRH and has a more prolonged duration of action than human CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], which makes it useful for clinical testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In contrast, the peak serum cortisol value is similar at both times of day, but the increment is smaller in the morning when the basal value is higher. In patients with Cushing's syndrome, in whom the normal circadian rhythm in ACTH secretion is absent, the CRH test can be performed at any time of day with similar results. Hyperglycemia does not appear to influence the results, as judged by response during a hyperglycemic clamp study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CRH PLUS ARGININE VASOPRESSIN OR DESMOPRESSIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arginine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> (AVP) potentiates the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in most normal subjects, producing a greater than additive increase in plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and serum cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Adrenal tumors, which secrete sufficient cortisol to increase urinary free cortisol levels, are also unable to respond because ACTH secretion is suppressed. However, this disorder can be easily differentiated by the demonstration of low plasma ACTH concentrations versus normal or the high concentrations in pituitary or ectopic Cushing's syndrome. Thus, a response to CRH or CRH plus vasopressin should differentiate Cushing's disease from all other causes of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">CRH stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with Cushing's disease respond with ACTH and cortisol increases within 45 minutes after CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/2,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20-24</a>]. However, the criteria for interpretation have varied at different centers.</p><p>One group developed criteria for the diagnosis of Cushing's disease that excluded all patients with ectopic ACTH secretion (100 percent specificity). The ACTH and cortisol responses to ovine CRH in Cushing's disease were defined as a 35 percent increase in the basal plasma ACTH concentration or a 20 percent increase in the basal serum cortisol concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This report included 101 patients with untreated Cushing's disease and 17 patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome. At 100 percent specificity, the sensitivity for ACTH was 93 percent, while it was 88 percent for cortisol.</p><p>Ovine CRH was evaluated in another study of 49 patients with Cushing's disease and 10 with ectopic ACTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. ROC curve analysis determined that an ACTH increment of at least 50 percent gave the best diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity for Cushing's disease, 86 percent and specificity 90 percent). Cortisol did not work as well and was not analyzed further.</p><p>Another study analyzed the responses to human CRH, 100 mcg, in 101 patients with Cushing's disease and 14 with ectopic ACTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The mean serum cortisol value at 15 and 30 minutes after CRH increased by at least 14 percent in 85 percent of patients with Cushing's disease, but in none with ectopic ACTH secretion. The best plasma ACTH criterion, a maximal increase of 105 percent at any time point, had only 70 percent sensitivity for Cushing's disease. Thus, the criteria for interpretation of the test are different for the ovine and human CRH analogs; if the latter is used, cortisol is probably the best outcome measure, based on the superior sensitivity and specificity in this study. Another study evaluated the utility of either human or ovine CRH stimulation in 148 patients with Cushing's disease and 12 with ectopic ACTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], using an increase in ACTH or cortisol levels of at least 50 percent to indicate Cushing's disease. Ovine CRH had better sensitivity than human CRH, probably because of the criteria used for interpretation; the sensitivity of the ACTH increment was similar (&asymp;86 percent) for each. No patient with ectopic ACTH secretion had a positive response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">CRH plus arginine vasopressin stimulation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with Cushing's disease respond with a 35 percent or greater increase in plasma ACTH concentrations 10 to 15 minutes after CRH plus arginine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> (AVP) injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/9,14-17,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14-17,20,25</a>]. The absolute ACTH response tends to be exaggerated, although the percent increase above the high baseline is not much different in our experience from that in normal subjects.</p><p>Although the CRH plus AVP test appeared to eliminate the false negative responses associated with the lone administration of CRH or AVP as no patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome were tested, the discriminatory value of the combined test remains unproven. Because of the potential for adverse side-effects, and the limited data on the performance of the test, the combined CRH plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> stimulation is preferred.

In this study, the combined test strategy had the highest diagnostic accuracy. It correctly identified 16 of 17 patients (94 percent) with Cushing's disease using and ACTH response criterion of 350 percent or more at 15 to 30 minutes after desmopressin.

ROC analysis indicated that an ACTH rise of 218 percent after combined administration gave the best diagnostic outcome, with a sensitivity of 88 percent and specificity of 80 percent.

However, while the combined CRH-desmopressin test is promising, until additional patients are studied, it is probably wise to use conservative cut-off points for its interpretation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Caveats to the use of CRH, AVP or desmopressin in Cushing's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with an adrenal tumor causing Cushing's syndrome or ectopic ACTH secretion do not respond to CRH alone or in combination with AVP or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulation-test/abstract/9,10,14-17,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,14-17,25-30</a>].
