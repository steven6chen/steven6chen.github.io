A meta-analysis that included 25 randomized trials comparing iodixanol with a diverse group of low-osmolal agents (n = 5053, approximately 72 percent with known renal impairment or diabetes) reported a modest reduction in risk of AKI (pooled relative risk [RR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.65-0.99) with iodixanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the small reduction in risk is unlikely to be clinically meaningful, although it was marginally statistically significant.

However, three trials that compared iodixanol with two other nonionic low-osmolal contrast agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ioversol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ioversol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iopamidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iopamidol</a>) found no difference between groups in the incidence of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography/abstract/18,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,32,33</a>]. In addition, a meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials also suggested that iodixanol was associated with a reduction in risk among patients with CKD who received contrast when compared with iohexol (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.56) but <strong>not</strong> when compared with other nonionic low-osmolal contrast agents (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>These data suggest that the benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodixanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iodixanol</a> compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iohexol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iohexol</a> may represent a unique nephrotoxic effect of iohexol.
