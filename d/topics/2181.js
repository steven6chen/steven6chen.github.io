As a result of the ability of the toxin to inhibit neurotransmission between peripheral nerves and muscle tissue, botulinum toxin is an effective treatment for aesthetic and medical concerns that are exacerbated by muscle contraction. Although US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the cosmetic use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> is limited to glabellar lines, lateral canthal lines (crow's feet), and forehead lines and FDA approval for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incobotulinumtoxina-xeomin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">incobotulinumtoxinA</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a> remains limited to the treatment of glabellar lines, injectable botulinum toxin is widely used for other cosmetic indications.</p><p>Examples of aesthetic concerns on the face and neck that can be improved with botulinum toxin will be reviewed here. The mechanism of action, available formulations, general use, and adverse effects of botulinum toxin in cosmetic settings are discussed separately.

Clinicians with a thorough understanding of facial anatomy and the functional relationships between muscles in the face and neck can safely use botulinum toxin to selectively weaken specific muscles, resulting in favorable cosmetic results. An illustration of normal facial musculature is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58011 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Appropriate candidates for botulinum toxin injection are patients with specific cosmetic concerns that can be alleviated by local muscle weakening and who lack contraindications to therapy. Patients between the ages of 30 and 50 years often achieve the most benefit from treatment; a greater proportion of rhytides in older patients may be due to loss of skin elasticity, which is not alleviated by botulinum toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications#H522661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of botulinum toxin for cosmetic indications&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>Once patients have been determined to be good candidates for botulinum toxin therapy, care must be taken to ensure that the anatomic placement of injections is correct and that the doses used are appropriate based upon the treatment site and patient-specific characteristics (eg, anatomic variation, patient sex, and preferences regarding the magnitude of effect). Conservative treatment is preferred; improper placement of injections or an excessive dose of botulinum toxin can result in cosmetic or functional defects that persist for months. </p><p>There are seven serotypes of botulinum toxin, two of which are available for clinical use (botulinum toxin type A and botulinum toxin type B). Botulinum toxin type A has been the most extensively studied for cosmetic indications and is the serotype that will be reviewed here. A variety of formulations of botulinum toxin type A are available for clinical use worldwide; the agents most commonly used in North America include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> (Botox, Botox Cosmetic), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incobotulinumtoxina-xeomin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">incobotulinumtoxinA</a> (Xeomin, Bocouture), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a> (Dysport). <strong>Dosing is not interchangeable among the different formulations of botulinum toxin type A; all examples of doses provided below are specific to the form of botulinum toxin mentioned. </strong></p><p>The general principles of botulinum toxin therapy for cosmetic indications are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of botulinum toxin for cosmetic indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080941\"><span class=\"h1\">UPPER FACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The muscles of movement and expression in the upper face include the frontalis, a large quadrilateral muscle that raises the eyebrows and skin over the root of the nose and draws the scalp forward, and the glabellar complex, a group of brow-associated muscles (corrugator supercilii, procerus, depressor supercilii, and orbicularis oculi muscles) used primarily for expression, especially anger, displeasure, or concern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58011 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Hyperactivity or repetitive use of these muscles over time leads to the formation of skin lines that are exacerbated during muscle contraction (dynamic rhytides). Weakening of the responsible muscles with botulinum toxin can smooth vertical glabellar rhytides (related to the contraction of muscles in the glabellar complex), horizontal forehead rhytides (induced by frontalis muscle contraction), and periorbital lateral canthal rhytides (associated with contraction of the lateral orbicularis oculi muscle).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080948\"><span class=\"h2\">Glabellar rhytides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first report of the use of botulinum toxin for a cosmetic purpose focused on the treatment of glabellar rhytides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Glabellar lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71122 \">picture 1</a>) are caused by contraction of the corrugator supercilii and orbicularis oculi muscles, which move the brow medially, and the procerus and depressor supercilii muscles, which pull the brow inferiorly. The corrugator supercilii and procerus muscles are typically targeted during treatment. Beneficial effects from injection last for at least three months in most patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64007\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64007 \">picture 2A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Although the precise placement and number of injections is influenced by anatomical differences among patients, five injection sites are commonly used to weaken the brow depressors in the treatment of glabellar rhytides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65462\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65462 \">picture 2B</a>). All injections should be placed above the supraorbital rim to reduce the risk of upper eyelid ptosis. We typically inject into the corrugator supercilii muscles above the inner canthi bilaterally (30 percent of total dose per injection) followed by a third medial injection into the procerus (20 percent of total dose). We have found that the fourth and fifth injections are particularly beneficial in patients in whom the brow musculature leads to the appearance of horizontal eyebrows. These injections are placed 1 cm above the supraorbital rim in the mid-pupillary line (10 percent of total dose per injection), but can also be sited above the lateral canthus, above the bony rim. </p><p>The standard doses recommended by the manufacturers of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA (Botox Cosmetic), <strong>inco</strong>botulinumtoxinA (Xeomin), and <strong>abo</strong>botulinumtoxinA (Dysport) are total doses 20 units, 20 units, and 50 units, respectively. However, the doses required to achieve desired results vary among patients due to differences in muscle mass or muscle activity. Males typically have greater muscle mass in the brow than females, and thus require higher doses to achieve satisfactory results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. We found the following results in two randomized dose-finding trials of 80 patients with glabellar rhytides:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dose of 10 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA was significantly less effective than 20, 30, or 40 units for the treatment of glabellar lines in women and was associated with a higher risk of relapse after four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among male patients, doses of 40, 60, or 80 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA were more effective and induced longer lasting benefit than treatment with 20 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The incidence of adverse effects was similar among treatment groups in both trials. Treatment-related adverse effects were transient and mild to moderate, and included symptoms such as headache, symptoms of tension or heaviness in the forehead or brow, ptosis of the brow, and muscle spasms in the forehead.</p><p>We typically initiate treatment with approximately 30 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA in women and 60 units in men, with subsequent increases in dose up to 50 or 100 units, respectively, based upon response. Lower initial doses (10 to 30 units for women and 20 to 40 units for men) have also been used for glabellar rhytides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For treatment with <strong>abo</strong>botulinumtoxinA, dose ranges of 30 to 70 units in women and 50 to 80 units in men have been suggested by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>We have found that some patients benefit from a total of seven injections, with the additional two injections placed into the lateral orbicularis oculi muscle. These injections are performed above the lateral canthus or into the lateral end of the eyebrow, and can result in further reductions in the glabellar lines and improved positioning of the lateral brow. We typically use 4 to 8 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA in these sites. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080955\"><span class=\"h2\">Horizontal forehead rhytides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraction of the frontalis muscle eventually leads to the formation of horizontal creases in the forehead that are exacerbated during brow elevation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50165\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50165 \">picture 3A</a>). Botulinum toxin injection can reduce the appearance of these lines both during muscle contraction and at rest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71162\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71162 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In our experience, the beneficial effects of treatment in this area typically last between three and six months.</p><p>The goal of treatment is to weaken but not completely paralyze the frontalis muscle. Patients with favorable responses have reduced forehead rhytides and remain able to elevate the brows, albeit to a lesser extent. Treatment of the frontalis muscle for horizontal rhytides should always be performed in conjunction with treatment of the brow depressors. Weakening of the frontalis muscle without corresponding inhibition of the brow depressors can result in unopposed action of the depressors and a lowered, angry-looking brow.</p><p>In a randomized, dose-finding trial that investigated the efficacy of treatment with <strong>ona</strong>boutlinumtoxinA in 59 women with moderate to severe forehead rhytides, total doses of 16, 32, and 48 units injected into the brow elevators and depressors (frontalis, procerus, and lateral orbicularis oculi muscles) (8, 16, and 24 units injected into the frontalis) all were effective for achieving improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of note, a statistically significant trend towards longer durations of response was observed with increasing doses. Sixteen weeks after treatment, wrinkle severity at maximum muscle contraction and repose had returned to baseline in 75, 58, and 35 percent of patients in the 16, 32, and 48 unit treatment groups, respectively. The number of adverse effects was similar among treatment groups and no serious adverse effects occurred during the course of the trial. </p><p>As in the glabellar area, patient-specific characteristics influence botulinum toxin administration. We typically perform five injections in patients with broad foreheads (greater than 12 cm between the temporal fusion lines at the mid-brow) and four injections in patients with narrower foreheads, using a slightly lower total dose in the latter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75187 \">picture 3B</a>). The total amount of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxin we inject into the frontalis muscle usually ranges between 10 and 15 units. Treatment with 40 units (range 20 to 60 units) of <strong>abo</strong>botulinumtoxinA in four injection sites has been utilized by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Injections into the frontalis muscle must be placed carefully to avoid undesirable cosmetic results. We inject horizontally across the mid-forehead, approximately 2 to 3 cm above the eyebrows. The use of excessive doses or placement of injections too close to the brow can result in inhibition of facial expression and brow ptosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080962\"><span class=\"h2\">Lateral canthal rhytides (crow's feet)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The orbicularis oculi muscle complex plays an important role in eyelid closure. Contraction of the lateral fibers of the orbicularis oculi muscle also produces lines (also known as crow's feet) that radiate from the lateral canthus and are exacerbated during smiling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59956\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59956 \">picture 5A</a>). Botulinum toxin injection into this area can reduce the appearance of these rhytides (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50135\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50135 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>]. </p><p>A dose-dependent effect of treatment has been reported. In one randomized trial in which 157 patients with moderate to severe lateral canthal rhytides were treated with varying doses of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA or placebo, the rates of treatment response remained significantly greater than placebo for longer periods of time with higher doses than with lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients treated with 12 or 18 units per side maintained significant improvement at maximal smile for at least 150 days after treatment, while the difference between placebo and treatment groups was no longer statistically significant in patients treated with 3 or 6 units at 60 or 150 days, respectively. The authors also commented that the magnitude of effect appeared to be higher in patients treated with the higher doses of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA. </p><p>Because the orbicularis oculi muscle is diffusely innervated, multiple injections are required to weaken the muscle effectively. We typically inject 12 to 15 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA per periocular region divided into two to four injection sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54110\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54110 \">picture 5B</a>).</p><p>A separate randomized trial of <strong>abo</strong>botulinumtoxinA injections for lateral canthal rhytides found that doses of 15, 30, and 45 units per side were all effective, but detected a trend towards increased response rates with doses of 30 and 45 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Use of a total dose of 30 units, divided into three injection points per side, has been suggested by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p><strong>Inco</strong>botulinumtoxinA has also been used successfully for the treatment of periocular rhytides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In order to minimize the risk for complications, all injections should be placed laterally to the lateral orbital rim and should be performed while the face is at rest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54110\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54110 \">picture 5B</a>). Medial injections or injections performed while the patient is smiling can result in eyelid droop and lip ptosis, respectively. Additionally, bruising is easily induced in the periorbital area; performing only a few superficial injections may reduce this risk. The application of manual pressure immediately after needle withdrawal may also reduce the occurrence of bruising.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080969\"><span class=\"h2\">Brow lift</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brow ptosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71706\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71706 \">picture 7</a>), a common feature of aging, can result in facial features at rest that mimic angry or scowling facial expressions. Because the shape and height of the eyebrow are controlled by the opposing action of the frontalis muscle, which elevates the brow, and the muscles that depress the brow, botulinum toxin can be used to improve brow ptosis.</p><p>The nonsurgical brow lift with botulinum toxin was discovered serendipitously during treatment of glabellar frown lines, as it became evident that treated patients exhibited central and medial brow elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Elevation of the brow was initially thought to be due to inactivation of the medial depressor muscles. However, weakening of the lower medial frontalis muscle due to local diffusion of botulinum toxin may be responsible for improved resting tone in the rest of the frontalis musculature and subsequent brow elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Typically, brow elevation is best seen when the glabellar area is treated without concurrent injection of frontalis muscle for horizontal forehead lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Additionally, lateral eyebrow elevation has been reported after injections limited to the superolateral orbicularis oculi muscle (tail of the eyebrow) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080976\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrophic orbicularis oculi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulinum toxin can be used to widen the ocular aperture by weakening the orbicularis oculi muscle complex, resulting in the appearance of a wider, rounder eye during smiling and at rest. </p><p>We evaluated the use of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA for this indication in a randomized, split-face trial of 15 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Injection of 2 units of botulinum toxin subdermally into the lower eyelid, 3 mm below the ciliary margin, increased palpebral aperture in 40 percent of patients (average increase in palpebral aperture was 0.5 mm at rest and 1.3 mm at maximum smile). Similar injections on the contralateral side given in combination with 12 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA into the lateral orbital area enhanced the effect; increases in palpebral aperture occurred in 86 percent of patients (mean increase in palpebral aperture of 1.8 mm at rest and 2.9 mm at full smile). Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. </p><p>Doses of more than 4 units of botulinum toxin in the lower eyelid are not recommended, due to an increased risk for adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Poor candidates for this procedure include patients who respond poorly to a preinjection snap test (lower eyelid does not return quickly to the globe after abrupt release from manual downward retraction), patients who are susceptible to lower lid puffiness, patients who have had ablative laser resurfacing of the lower eyelid, or patients who have had lower lid blepharoplasty without concomitant canthopexy to support the normal eyelid position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080990\"><span class=\"h1\">MID-FACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulinum toxin injection is useful for the treatment of several cosmetic concerns in the mid-facial area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58011 \">figure 1</a>). Injection into the upper nasalis muscle can soften wrinkling on the dorsal or lateral nose (also known as &quot;bunny lines&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52791%7EDERM%2F64576\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52791 graphicRef64576 \">picture 8A-B</a>). We typically utilize 2 to 4 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA per side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67933\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67933 \">picture 9</a>); doses of 10 to 20 units of <strong>abo</strong>botulinumtoxinA have also been used for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In our practice, we have found that injection of 5 to 10 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA into the lower nasalis is useful for reducing nostril flare. A small amount of <strong>ona</strong>butlinumtoxinA (2 to 3 units) into the depressor septi nasi muscle can also be used to slightly elevate the nasal tip. </p><p>Prominent nasolabial folds, which extend from the lateral nasal alae to the skin lateral to the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F77905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77905 \">picture 10</a>), are common cosmetic concerns that are often managed with injectable soft tissue fillers and laser resurfacing. Very small amounts of botulinum toxin (eg, 1 unit of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA) into each lip elevator complex above the nasofacial groove can collapse the upper nasolabial fold. However, this procedure may also vertically lengthen the upper lip, a feature associated with aging. Thus, we only consider this procedure in patients with naturally short upper lips. Treatment may be most effective when combined with soft tissue fillers or laser resurfacing.

Injections should not be placed directly into the nasolabial fold, as this may result in an asymmetrical smile or lip ptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1727944\"><span class=\"h1\">LOWER FACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulinum toxin injection in the lower face is commonly performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58011 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, injections must be given with caution. Improper injection in the perioral area may result in a flaccid cheek, an incompetent mouth, or an asymmetrical smile.

In a series of 18 patients treated with varying doses of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA, smoothing of perioral rhytides and favorable eversion of the upper lip were detected after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>We often inject 2 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA per lip quadrant, divided into two injection sites within each quadrant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62503 \">picture 11B</a>). Doses of <strong>abo</strong>botulinumtoxinA suggested by other authors include 8 units divided into four injection points for the upper lip and 4 units divided into two injection points in the lower lip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Placing injections superficially and utilizing conservative dosing may help to minimize the risks of treatment. However, avoidance of this procedure should be considered in patients who require intense use of the perioral musculature, such as professional singers and orators or musicians who play wind instruments.</p><p>Injection of the oral commissures (corners of the lip) and the midline area should be avoided, as it may result in a drooping lateral lip and flattening of the Cupid's bow, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4081004\"><span class=\"h2\">Mouth frown and melomental folds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The depressor anguli oris (DAO) muscle pulls the corner of the mouth downward in opposition to the action of the zygomaticus major and zygomaticus minor muscles. When the lateral corners of the mouth angle downward, the mouth takes on a frowning, unpleasant expression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76339\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76339 \">picture 12</a>). Botulinum toxin can be used to weaken the DAO and subtly reset muscular balance, allowing the zygomaticus to elevate the corners of the mouth and return them to a horizontal position. As with perioral lip rhytides, treatment of this area is not recommended in patients in whom intense use of the perioral musculature is essential (eg, professional singers and wind instrument musicians).</p><p>In order to avoid unintentional weakening of the nearby depressor labii inferioris muscle during the treatment of mouth frown, we inject at the posterior margin of the DAO muscle, close to the anterior margin of the masseter. We usually utilize 2 to 3 units of <strong>ona</strong>botulinumtoxinA per side. Because the upward pull of the mentalis muscle also contributes to mouth frown, we perform additional 3 unit injections into each insertion point of the mentalis muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69123 \">picture 13</a>). </p><p>Contraction of the DAO muscle also exacerbates the melomental folds (also known as marionette lines) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55290\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55290 \">picture 14</a>). Melomental folds have traditionally been corrected with soft tissue filling agents, but the benefit from treatment is generally short-lived. Treatment with botulinum toxin may potentiate the results of soft tissue filler injections by reducing the mobility of the underlying musculature. In one split-face randomized trial of 22 patients with melomental folds, photographic assessments revealed longer durations of effect after combination therapy than after treatment with a filling agent alone (median time to return to baseline of 39 weeks versus 32.5 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulinum-toxin-for-cosmetic-indications-treatment-of-specific-sites/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the difference in the rate of relapse was not significant on live clinician assessment. Additional studies are necessary to explore the value of combination therapy in this setting.

In our experience, small doses of botulinum toxin injected into the mentalis muscle just anterior to the bony mentum on each side of the midline soften the indentation.

Injection at the level of the mental crease should be avoided, as this can weaken the orbicularis oris muscle, creating mouth incompetence that can last for up to six months.</p><p>In patients with local loss of dermal collagen and subcutaneous fat on the chin due to aging, contraction of the mentalis muscle can contribute to the appearance of multiple dimpled areas on the chin (peau d'orange chin) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76750 \">picture 16</a>).
