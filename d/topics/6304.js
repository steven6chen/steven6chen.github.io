However, the highest risk for HAP is in patients on mechanical ventilation (ie, ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]), in whom the entity has been best studied.</p><p>According to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), there has been a steady decline in reported VAP rates in the United States; between 2006 and 2012, in medical ICUs, the reported incidence of VAP per 1000 ventilator-days decreased from 3.1 to 0.9 and, in surgical ICUs, the reported incidence decreased from 5.2 to 2.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In contrast, using data from the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (limited to patients &ge;65 years of age) and a stable definition of VAP, the rate of VAP has remained stable among ventilated patients over time (10.8 percent during 2005 to 2006 versus 9.7 percent during 2012 to 2013) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Possible reasons for these discordant results include differences in definitions of VAP, differences in hospitals or patient populations, changes in characteristics of hospitals reporting to the NHSN over time, and preferential declines in VAP rates among hospitals reporting to the NHSN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>VAP is associated with long hospital stays and significant costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two studies estimated that VAP prolongs the length of mechanical ventilation by 7.6 to 11.5 days and prolongs hospitalization by 11.5 to 13.1 days compared with similar patients without VAP; the excess cost associated with VAP has been estimated at approximately $40,000 per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The prognosis of HAP and VAP is discussed separately.

The primary route of infection of the lungs is through microaspiration of organisms that have colonized the oropharyngeal tract (or, to lesser extent, the gastrointestinal tract). Approximately 45 percent of healthy subjects aspirate during sleep, and an even higher proportion of severely ill patients aspirate routinely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although frequently regarded as partially protective, the presence of an endotracheal tube permits the aspiration of oropharyngeal material or bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Depending upon the number and virulence of the organisms reaching the lung, pneumonia may ensue.</p><p>Hospitalized patients often become colonized with microorganisms acquired from the hospital environment, and as many as 75 percent of severely ill patients will be colonized within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The most common mechanism of infection in mechanically ventilated patients is direct contact with environmental reservoirs, including respiratory devices and contaminated water reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Such contamination frequently occurs despite rigorous cleaning of ventilator equipment because disposable tubing used in respiratory circuits or tracheostomy or endotracheal tubes may become contaminated in the process of routine nursing care or via the (contaminated) hands of hospital personnel.</p><p>In addition, the near sterility of the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract may be disrupted by alterations in gastric pH due to illness, medications, or enteric feedings. For this reason, much attention has been paid to the possible adverse effect of ulcer prophylaxis regimens that raise the gastric pH. Less frequently, pneumonia results from inhalation of infectious aerosols or from bacteremia originating in a distant focus.

Common pathogens include aerobic gram-negative bacilli (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Enterobacter </em>spp, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp) and gram-positive cocci (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus </em>[MRSA], <em>Streptococcus </em>spp) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Nosocomial pneumonia due to viruses or fungi is significantly less common, except in the immunocompromised patient.</p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding whether the pathogens that cause VAP differ from those that cause HAP in patients who are not mechanically ventilated. One prospective observational study evaluated 158,519 patients admitted to a single center over a four-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A total of 327 episodes of VAP and 261 episodes of HAP in nonventilated patients were identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infecting flora in patients with VAP included methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em> (MSSA; 9 percent), MRSA (18 percent), <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (18 percent), <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em> (7 percent), <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp (8 percent), and other spp (9 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infecting flora in nonventilated patients with HAP was similar, except non-Enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli (<em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>Acinetobacter</em>, and <em>S. maltophilia</em>) were less likely.

In this study, there was a similar distribution of pathogens: MRSA (14.8 percent), <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (14.3 percent), and other <em>Staphylococcus</em> species (8.8 percent).</p><p>Of 8474 cases of VAP reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2010, the distribution of pathogens associated was <em>S. aureus</em> (24.1 percent), <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (16.6 percent), <em>Klebsiella</em> species (10.1 percent), <em>Enterobacter</em> species (8.6 percent), <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> (6.6 percent), and <em>E. coli</em> (5.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Similar findings were observed in another surveillance study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A frequent criticism of such studies is that they may underestimate the prevalence of certain pathogens (eg, anaerobes) because special culturing techniques are required to identify them. However, a study performed anaerobic cultures using protective brush specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 185 patients with possible VAP identified only one anaerobic organism, nonpathogenic <em>Veillonella</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This suggests that the practice of including anaerobic coverage in the treatment of VAP is unnecessary.</p><p>Differences in host factors and in the hospital flora of an institution also influence the patterns of pathogens seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">MDR risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of HAP and VAP depends in large part upon whether the patient has risk factors for MDR pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The frequency of specific MDR pathogens varies among hospitals, specific hospital units, and patient populations including those with recent exposure to antibiotics. An awareness of the susceptibility patterns of the nosocomial pathogens within a given healthcare setting is important for appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. The frequency of MDR bacteria as etiologic agents of HAP is increasing, especially among patients in ICUs.</p><p>Risk factors for MDR VAP are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109530\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109530 \">table 1</a>).

The 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">America/American</span> Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of HAP and VAP continue to recommend a clinical diagnosis based upon a new lung infiltrate plus clinical evidence that the infiltrate is of infectious origin, which includes the new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>When findings at autopsy were used as a standard of reference, the presence of a new or progressive radiographic infiltrate plus at least two of three clinical features (fever &gt;38&ordm;C, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and purulent secretions), this combination of findings resulted in 69 percent sensitivity and 75 percent specificity for pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic approach to VAP is similar and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-ventilator-associated-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Molecular diagnostic tests for detection of respiratory pathogens are being developed and offer promise for more rapid identification of the causes of HAP or VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although there are limitations regarding the specificity of these tests (eg, colonization or true pathogen), they offer the potential for more rapid identification of pathogens and resistance patterns (eg, methicillin resistance for <em>S. aureus</em>, carbapenemase presence for Enterobacteriaceae), which may result in better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Future studies to assess the utility of these tests are anticipated to evaluate if they will allow for more targeted use of antimicrobial agents (ie, pathogen-directed therapy).
