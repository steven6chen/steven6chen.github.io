The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience major depressive and hypomanic episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic and episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

Factors involved in choosing a drug regimen include past response to medications, whether the patient is breastfeeding, side effect profiles, patient preference, comorbid general medical conditions, potential for drug-drug interactions, and cost.</p><p>We try to avoid medications associated with weight gain and sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>) in postpartum bipolar patients. New mothers typically want to lose weight that was gained during pregnancy, and need to remain alert for their infants&rsquo; cries.</p><p>Family meetings can accomplish several tasks, such as educating family members about the illness, providing support and allaying their concerns, obtaining additional history about prior treatment, and recruiting them to support patient adherence with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2570349\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The setting for treatment of postpartum bipolar patients depends upon the type and severity of symptoms, level of psychosocial functioning, and available support. Inpatient hospitalization may be required for safety and stabilization, particularly for severely ill patients with one or more of the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotic features (delusions or hallucinations)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance dependence that is exacerbating the mood episode</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired functioning (inability to care for oneself)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor judgement that places the patient or others at imminent risk of being harmed (eg, neglecting the infant)</p><p/><p>In addition, the threshold for admission is lower in patients with poor social support or previous severe mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It may be feasible to treat moderately ill postpartum bipolar patients in a partial hospital (day) program, including patients with suicidality that does not pose an imminent risk (eg, fleeting thoughts of killing oneself with vague or nonexistent plans and no intent). An outpatient clinic may be suitable for less acutely ill patients (eg, thoughts that family members would be better off if the patient was dead, with no plan or intent to commit suicide).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2570356\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically monitor postpartum bipolar patients most closely (eg, weekly) during the first several weeks (eg, four) following parturition, when the large majority of mood episodes occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>For postpartum bipolar patients who suffer a mood episode, the frequency of visits depends upon the patient&rsquo;s clinical status. Hospitalized patients are assessed daily, and patients with active suicidal ideation, a specific plan, and intent to kill themselves may require constant observation. Outpatients are commonly seen on a weekly basis until they have responded (ie, the patient&rsquo;s safety has stabilized and the number, intensity, and frequency of psychotic and mood symptoms has improved substantially). Following response, patients can be seen every two to four weeks until they remit.</p><p>For postpartum bipolar patients who remit and remain stable, monitoring can be tapered, with progressively longer intervals between assessments. As an example, a patient who is seen every two weeks at the time of remission can be seen every two weeks for one to three more visits, then every month for one to three visits, and then every two months for one to three visits. Continuously stable patients can be seen every three to six months. More frequent visits should be scheduled for patients who develop symptoms or side effects (eg, sedation that interferes with infant care).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2570363\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bipolar symptoms (eg, impulsivity) can render patients incapable of safely parenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If clinicians are uncertain about the safety of children, child welfare agencies should be notified to determine the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of social support (eg, availability of relatives and visiting nurses to care for the patient and infant)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risks of a newborn remaining with the bipolar parent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risks of removing the child from the home </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2570370\"><span class=\"h3\">Feeding the infant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For postpartum bipolar patients who are treated with pharmacotherapy and have sufficient resources, we often suggest formula feeding the baby to avoid exposure to medications through breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>]. All psychotropic drugs appear to be excreted in breast milk at varying concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although breastfeeding has many potential benefits for both the mother and child, the mother&rsquo;s clinical status and need for pharmacotherapy should take priority over the method of feeding the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>However, breast milk is a reasonable alternative to formula for postpartum bipolar patients treated with pharmacotherapy. There are several benefits to breastfeeding, and many patients would rather forego medications than breastfeeding. We attempt to use drugs compatible with breastfeeding and doses at the low end of the therapeutic range, especially for infants less than three months of age, because their capacity to metabolize and clear medications is less than that of older infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Exposure to psychotropic agents through breastfeeding should also be minimized in premature infants, because their decreased ability to metabolize <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eliminate medications increases steady state plasma concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Postpartum bipolar patients should attempt to recruit family and friends to help with the newborn&rsquo;s nighttime feedings, to prevent sleep deprivation and the associated risk of recurrent mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-postpartum-women-treatment/abstract/11,13,23,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,23,27,28</a>]. Newborns fed with formula during the day are fed formula at night. Infants who are breastfed during the day can be fed at night with breast milk expressed while awake earlier in the day, or with supplemental formula.</p><p>The use of psychotropic medications in breastfeeding patients is discussed separately.

However, for patients with moderate to severe agitation, or patients with assaultive or grossly disorganized behavior, treatment commences at step 2. In addition, step 1 is skipped for patients who were treated with an antipsychotic immediately prior to admission.

After the dose of the second drug is in the therapeutic range, the benzodiazepine is tapered and discontinued. Choosing a drug for maintenance treatment is discussed elsewhere in this topic.

Either first-generation antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>) or second-generation antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>) can be used. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who do not respond to the benzodiazepine plus antipsychotic within two to three weeks or do not tolerate the antipsychotic are switched to a different antipsychotic.
