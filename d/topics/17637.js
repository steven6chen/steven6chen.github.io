When this happens, the arteries narrow, and the heart muscle does not get enough blood. This causes chest pain or discomfort, especially when you do physical activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94378126\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the treatment choices for angina (chest pain)?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 2 main types of treatment for angina. They are:</p><p><strong>Medical treatment</strong> &ndash; This includes different types of medicine, such as &quot;nitrates&quot; and &quot;beta blockers.&quot; These medicines work by relaxing blood vessels going to the heart muscle or reducing the amount of work the heart muscle has to do (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53164 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>If you have heart disease, you will also need to take other medicines, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called statins, which lower cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to lower blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Aspirin</a> or other medicines that help prevent blood clots in the arteries</p><p/><p>You should also make these lifestyle changes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quit smoking, if you smoke.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, but not a lot of meat or fatty foods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walk or do some form of physical activity on most days of the week.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p><strong>Procedures</strong> &ndash; These restore blood flow to the part of the heart that is not getting enough blood. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenting &ndash; During this procedure, the doctor puts a thin tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) into a blood vessel in the leg or arm and moves it to the clogged artery in the heart. Then the doctor inflates a tiny balloon inside the clogged artery to open it. In most people, the doctor props open the artery using a tiny metal tube called a stent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86256 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bypass surgery (also known as &quot;coronary artery bypass grafting&quot;) &ndash; During bypass surgery, the doctor removes a healthy piece of blood vessel from another part of the body. Then he or she reattaches this piece of blood vessel above and below the area that is clogged. This re-routes blood around the clogged artery, and allows it to get to the part of the heart that was not getting blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73589 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>For relieving angina, either one of these procedures might be better than medicines alone. But people who have them must still take medicines. In fact, skipping medicines after these procedures can be very dangerous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94378253\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know which treatment is best for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will help you decide which treatment is best for you. Many different factors affect the decision. These factors include your age, your symptoms, and the results of certain heart tests.</p><p>If your doctor recommends stenting or bypass surgery, ask these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How might this procedure help me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will it help me live longer?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will it reduce my chance of having a heart attack?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will I feel better if I have this procedure than I would with medicines alone?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of the procedure?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I don't have this procedure?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94378270\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac catheterization (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-angina-chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for angina (chest pain) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medications-for-angina-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Medications for angina (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-treatment-medical-versus-interventional-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Angina treatment &mdash; medical versus interventional therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
