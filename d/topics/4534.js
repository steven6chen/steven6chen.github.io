These terms are consistent with referral to psychiatric services, but they introduce etiologic assumptions that often cannot often be proven; as an example, the term conversion disorder is based upon the unproven psychoanalytic hypothesis that overwhelming affect, psychological conflict, or stress are unconsciously converted into symptoms that suggest a neurologic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, terms such as psychogenic may also connote &ldquo;faking&rdquo; or &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; behavior and thus alienate patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Functional&rdquo; (also consistent with DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]), meaning that the symptoms arise from abnormal nervous system functioning in the absence of structural pathology (eg, functional weakness). This term is etiologically neutral and usually acceptable to patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, it may seem vague and does not indicate that psychosocial factors may be important. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Dissociative (motor, sensory, or seizure) disorder&rdquo; (consistent with ICD-10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]), meaning sensation or control of movement is separated from awareness. The term is particularly useful to describe the trance-like state seen in nonepileptic seizures, but also implies that patients are suffering depersonalization or derealization (which is frequently not true).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Medically unexplained,&rdquo; meaning that the etiology is unknown. The term is neutral, but may imply that the clinician does not know what is wrong and is incapable of rendering a diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, it is difficult to prove that a symptom cannot be medically unexplained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Psychosomatic,&rdquo; meaning that the symptom is due to the interaction between the mind and body. However, this term is often interpreted to mean the same thing as somatization or psychogenic. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Nonorganic&rdquo; or &ldquo;pseudoneurologic,&rdquo; meaning that the patient does not have a disease with a known pathologic basis. The terms emphasize what patients do not have rather than what is present, and ignore the central nervous system underpinning of psychological phenomena. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Hysteria,&rdquo; which originally meant that symptoms were due to uterine pathology and implied that the disorder was exclusive to females. More recent definitions include emotional excess, overwhelming fear, and psychiatric symptoms involving disturbances of mental, sensory, vasomotor, and visceral functions. This term is generally considered a historic artifact.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954453\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with neurologic symptoms (eg, abnormal movements or seizures) that are not caused by neurologic disease, the diagnosis of conversion disorder (functional neurologic symptom disorder) should be made after the neurologist has established positive clinical findings that are incompatible with disease or are inconsistent across different parts of the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. In addition, clinicians and researchers frequently diagnose conversion disorder subtypes such as <span class=\"nowrap\">psychogenic/functional</span> movement disorders or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. </p><p>Prior to 2013, conversion disorder could be diagnosed according to the criteria in either the American Psychiatric Association&rsquo;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], or the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, neither nosologic system was widely used in its entirety because many patients did not fulfill all of the criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In particular, both nosologies stipulated that conversion symptoms were associated with or caused by psychologic factors. For many patients, psychologic factors are not identifiable, and even when they are identified, it&rsquo;s not always clear that they are etiologically relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require that clinicians identify psychological factors associated with the conversion symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (Nevertheless, clinicians should continue to look for psychological factors where relevant.) In addition, clinicians no longer need to establish that the symptom is not feigned; by contrast, DSM-IV-TR required that the symptom was not intentionally produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. DSM-5 classifies conversion disorder among the somatic symptom and related disorders, which are marked by somatic symptoms that are associated with distress and psychosocial impairment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954197\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A DSM-5 diagnosis of conversion disorder requires each of the following criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91102 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings that demonstrate incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurologic or general medical conditions (eg, Hoover's sign of functional limb weakness or a positive entrainment test for functional tremor)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptom or deficit causes significant distress, psychosocial impairment, or warrants medical evaluation &#160;</p><p/><p>The diagnosis rests upon positive clinical findings that indicate the symptom is incongruent with anatomy, physiology, or known diseases, or is inconsistent at different times (eg, a &ldquo;paralyzed&rdquo; limb will move inadvertently when the patient is distracted by performing movements in their unaffected limb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Clinicians must ensure that the symptoms are not better explained by a neurologic or other general medical disease, and should bear in mind that our knowledge of neurologic disease, anatomy, and physiology is incomplete. Neurologic and general medical disorders that are included in the differential diagnosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H2516698\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic and general medical disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>However, conversion disorder can be diagnosed in patients who have comorbid neurologic diseases, provided there is evidence that the diseases do not better explain the conversion symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conversion-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features-assessment-and-comorbidity#H13158943\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conversion disorder in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and comorbidity&quot;, section on 'Neurologic and general medical disorders'</a>.)</p><p>In diagnosing conversion disorder, it is not necessary to identify conflicts or other stressors associated with conversion symptoms (although doing so may help patient management) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1,10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,15,16</a>]. Psychological factors are frequently observed in patients with conversion symptoms, but this is not always the case. In addition, when psychological factors are present, it is difficult to establish the etiologic relationship between these factors and conversion disorder because psychological factors are ubiquitous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. Trauma, conflicts, and stressors may have a specific etiologic relationship with conversion disorder, a nonspecific relationship (ie, psychologic factors may contribute to onset of psychiatric disorders in general), or the presence of psychological factors may be coincidental. However, a close temporal relationship between a stressor and onset or worsening of conversion symptoms may aid diagnosis (eg, &ldquo;hand dystonia after signing an unwelcome document&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]), especially if there is a prior history of conversion symptoms under similar circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional information about premorbid clinical factors and the etiology of conversion disorder is discussed separately.

However, if there is evidence that the symptoms are feigned, then the diagnosis of conversion disorder should not be made. Evidence that suggests patients with conversion disorder are not feigning includes the consistency among different patients in how they report their symptoms, the common pattern of comorbidity and physical evidence (eg, abnormal shoe wear, disuse atrophy, and contractures) across patients, and the distress and disability that is observed in follow up studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is also worth noting that awareness of what is happening may not be &ldquo;all or nothing;&rdquo; rather, there may be gradations of awareness along a continuum, and the patient&rsquo;s level of awareness may change over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Exposure to a common precipitant may lead to shared conversion symptoms in a group of people (&ldquo;mass hysteria&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

Clinicians faced with symptoms that are difficult to interpret should exercise caution in diagnosing conversion disorder, no matter how much the psychiatric history suggests it. Patients may notice symptoms of an occult disease during its early stage when signs on physical examination or laboratory test abnormalities are not readily apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, more unusual neurologic diseases such as stiff person syndrome, autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and frontal lobe epilepsy may present with unusual features such as symptom variability, bizarre behavior (eg, cycling leg movements or pelvic thrusting), or other symptoms (eg, emotional lability) that might lead the unwary to consider a &ldquo;psychogenic&rdquo; disorder. The effects of a neurologic disease can be frightening, which may lead patients to exaggerate their symptoms to convince a doctor about their problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Laryngeal dystonia may be either a primary pathologic phenomenon or secondary to illnesses such as Parkinson disease or multiple systems atrophy. Clues that the speech impairment may be due to conversion disorder include the presence of a normal cough or singing voice. The diagnosis of conversion disorder is confirmed by normal vocal cord movement on laryngoscopy.

Somatic symptoms that cause distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impairment can occur in both somatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder, and some patients may warrant both diagnoses. Patients with somatic symptom disorder suffer from an excessive response to somatic symptoms, but do not typically have loss of function that is clearly incompatible with anatomy, physiology, and recognized neurologic or general medical illnesses; the disorder can thus occur in patients whose symptoms are explained by recognized diseases. By contrast, conversion disorder is characterized by evidence of inconsistency between the clinical findings and recognized disease. Also, the excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur in somatic symptom disorder may not be present in conversion disorder.

However, conversion disorder presents with symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function, and clinical findings that demonstrate incompatibility between the symptoms and recognized neurologic conditions, whereas <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder does not.

The primary distinction is that patients with factitious disorder deliberately feign symptoms and deceive clinicians to be a patient and obtain medical care. In conversion disorder, there is no clear evidence that symptoms have been simulated for the purpose of receiving medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1,10,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,15-17</a>]. &#160; </p><p>A clue that patients are feigning includes varying accounts of symptoms to different clinicians. However, it is possible to establish feigning only if the patient acknowledges deliberately producing symptoms, or if other evidence demonstrates a major inconsistency between reported and observed function (eg, a patient who reports an inability to walk is subsequently observed on a video recording playing tennis). Minor discrepancies are in keeping with the variable nature of conversion symptoms, which tend to worsen when attention is paid to them.</p><p>Additional information about factitious disorder is discussed separately.

The essential feature of malingering is intentionally faking or exaggerating symptoms for an obvious external benefit, such as money, housing, medications, or avoiding work or criminal prosecution. Malingering is a behavior and not a psychiatric disorder. In conversion disorder there is no evidence of intentionally producing symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/conversion-disorder-in-adults-terminology-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1,10,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,15-17</a>]. </p><p>Clinicians should consider the possibility of malingering if any of the following is present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple inconsistencies in the patient&rsquo;s history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonadherence with diagnostic evaluation or treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antisocial personality disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical-legal context (eg, patient is referred by an attorney for evaluation)</p><p/><p>Other clues that patients are feigning symptoms are discussed above.
