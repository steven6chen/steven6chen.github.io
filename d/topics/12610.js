Patients may present with a wide array of symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings and have a variable prognosis that depends upon the disease severity and type of organ involvement. Establishing the diagnosis of SLE may be challenging, and the approach to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of SLE is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to the variable disease course, effective management of SLE requires regular clinical and laboratory monitoring to assess disease activity; guide therapy to alleviate symptoms and prevent and treat relapses; assess side effects related to drug therapy; encourage adherence with medications; and coordinate care with the patient's other providers.</p><p>This topic will review the general issues related to the management of patients with SLE. The treatment of specific organ involvement is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H925551\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are to ensure long-term survival, achieve the lowest possible disease activity, prevent organ damage, minimize drug toxicity, improve quality of life, and educate patients about their role in disease management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Treatment of SLE is individualized based upon patient preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], clinical manifestations, disease activity and severity, and comorbidities. Patients require monitoring at regular intervals by a rheumatologist to optimize both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies, and achieve treatment goals. Patients often have multiorgan system involvement and may require multidisciplinary care.</p><p>Our management strategy for SLE is generally consistent with guidelines developed by professional organizations, including the European League Against Rheumatism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and the British Society for Rheumatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Specific guidelines for the management of lupus nephritis are discussed separately in the relevant topics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE ACTIVITY AND SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the appropriate therapeutic regimen requires an accurate assessment of both disease activity and severity and a clear understanding of the patient's response to previous and ongoing therapeutic interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. It is also important to assess for the wide range of disease manifestations. Disease activity refers to the manifestations of the underlying inflammatory process at a point in time in terms of magnitude and intensity. The disease severity refers to the type and level of organ dysfunction and its consequences, often described as mild, moderate, and severe. The degree of irreversible organ dysfunction has been referred to as damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Furthermore, features attributable to active SLE must be distinguished from chronic damage, drug toxicities, and other conditions such as infection. As an example, marked proteinuria and a reduced glomerular filtration rate may result from either active inflammation or scarred glomeruli. Differentiating between these two possibilities has significant therapeutic implications, since immunosuppressive therapy should not be escalated in the latter setting. Similarly, joint pain may be related to active synovitis for which glucocorticoids may be indicated, or it may be due to avascular necrosis which is a side effect of treatment with glucocorticoids.</p><p>As part of the clinical and laboratory evaluation, all organ systems must be reviewed since almost any organ can be involved in SLE. If specific symptoms are present, patients should also be asked about any potential triggers such as sun exposure, infection, or discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>The physical examination should be extensive (complete) and include examination of the skin (including scalp and mucous membranes) and lymph nodes, as well as respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. A more detailed discussion of all of the clinical manifestations associated with SLE is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of validated indices have been developed primarily for research purposes to measure disease activity or damage; however, their incorporation into clinical practice is often limited by the time needed to complete them. (See <a href=\"#H213087095\" class=\"local\">'Research tools'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to obtaining a detailed clinical history and performing a thorough physical exam, laboratory tests may be used to help assess disease activity and monitor organ-specific complications (such as renal or hematological) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Since there is no single marker of disease activity, clinicians must interpret the laboratory results in the appropriate clinical context.</p><p>We typically check the following laboratory tests when monitoring disease activity in all patients with SLE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (CBC) &ndash; Leukopenia is common and may reflect active disease. Anemia and thrombocytopenia may also be observed with active disease. Cytopenias may also result from drug toxicities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]) &ndash; Increases in acute phase reactants are commonly observed in patients with SLE, and therefore may not be as reliable for detecting disease activity as is the case with other inflammatory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Nonetheless, an elevated ESR can be associated with increased disease activity and accrued damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Similarly, elevations in CRP can also be associated with disease activity. There are conflicting data on the diagnostic value of a markedly elevated CRP in distinguishing active lupus from infection; however, an elevated CRP should raise the suspicion for infection in a patient with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis with examination of urinary sediment &ndash; Proteinuria or cellular casts and hematuria may be due to lupus involving the kidney.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibodies-to-double-stranded-ds-dna-sm-and-u1-rnp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibodies to double-stranded (ds)DNA, Sm, and U1 RNP&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement levels (C3 and C4) &ndash; Low C3 and C4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated C3 and C4 activation products often indicate active lupus, particularly lupus nephritis.

It has been noted that some SLE patients have ANAs that decrease in titer over time; however, the clinical utility of this observation remains unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603123222\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring for specific SLE-related organ involvement typically requires additional studies. Depending on the organ system in question, appropriate investigations such as electrocardiogram, lung function tests, x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and renal or other organ (eg, skin) biopsies may be required to further evaluate the abnormalities detected on clinical assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86085872\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency with which monitoring laboratory tests are performed is tailored to each patient. Factors that should be taken into account when determining the frequency of visits include the history of the patient's prior symptoms, current disease activity status, disease severity, and frequency and severity of prior disease flares. As an example, a patient with active lupus nephritis may require laboratory tests every one to two weeks to monitor and guide therapy. By contrast, another patient with previously active nephritis, but whose SLE is quiescent, may be tested every three to four months.</p><p>Although expert groups recommend that SLE patients with stable disease be monitored less frequently (eg, at up to six-month intervals), there is evidence that these patients benefit from closer follow-up at three- to four-month intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>]. A study including over 500 SLE patients with mild or inactive disease found that one in four patients followed over a two-year period will have a clinically silent laboratory abnormality (eg, low complement or hematuria) that could lead to a change in management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The average length of time between visits in the aforementioned study was 3.8 months, highlighting the importance of regular patient monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213087095\"><span class=\"h2\">Research tools</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory tests</strong> &ndash; Numerous laboratory tests assessing disease activity have been reported; however, their utility is limited because they are either unconfirmed or not accessible for routine clinical care. Some of these investigational markers that have been shown to correlate with disease activity include vitamin D receptors, urinary interleukin (IL)-6, and complement activation markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/14,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,26-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease activity indices</strong> &ndash; A number of disease activity measures or indices have been developed and are generally used for research purposes. These measures are often used in observational and clinical trials to evaluate outcomes, differences among SLE groups, and their responses to therapeutic interventions. All of the indices use a combination of history, examination, and laboratory data; they may have general applicability to clinical practice if simplified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of scoring systems for global disease activity include the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K), the Revised Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM-R), the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/10,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,30-33</a>]. Other assessment scales that assess disease activity in a single organ include the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-2004 (BILAG-2004) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. While the BILAG can assess single organs, it provides information on multiple systems and can be used in a composite form.Clinical trials are also using combinations of indices to create composite assessment measures for determining trial outcomes. Examples include the SRI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Response Index), used in the pivotal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=belimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">belimumab</a> trials; and the BICLA (BILAG-based Combined Lupus Assessment), used in a trial of epratuzumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Damage indices</strong> &ndash; A damage index score is a measure for chronic damage and is typically used in clinical research for its prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Damage can reflect the effects of either disease activity or treatment. The systemic lupus international collaborating clinics American College of Rheumatology damage index <span class=\"nowrap\">(SLICC/ACR-DI)</span> is used to measure accumulated damage that has occurred since disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213087503\"><span class=\"h2\">Flares</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528967652\"><span class=\"h3\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical course of SLE is variable and may be characterized by unpredictable disease flares and remissions. There is no consensus on what constitutes a disease flare, but most definitions have incorporated a combination of results from serologic measures and disease activity indices. Flares are generally categorized by severity, with moderate or severe flares being the most clinically significant. Most clinicians agree that a moderate or severe flare refers to a measurable increase in disease activity that is clinically meaningful enough to result in a change in therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. A challenge in clinical practice is to stratify patients at risk for disease flares. We use serologic measures of disease activity in the context of the clinical presentation and organ domain involvement to evaluate for a disease flare. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Since almost any organ system can be involved in a lupus flare, there are myriad combinations of signs and symptoms that could constitute a lupus flare. Some examples of lupus exacerbations that range in severity from mild to severe, in patients with previously quiescent or stable disease, are presented below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild SLE flare &ndash; A patient who develops new onset low-grade fevers, a malar rash, and arthralgias, and who also feels increasingly fatigued. Laboratory evaluation is notable for a mild leukopenia. This patient may require no treatment. Alternatively, the patient may require the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> or the equivalent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 7.5 mg per day or less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate SLE flare &ndash; A patient with SLE who develops pleuritic chest pain and a swelling of the wrists.

Persistently low serum levels of complement C1q are also associated with activity of lupus nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>However, not all patients with these serologic markers have active disease, and these markers do not necessarily predict disease exacerbation or &quot;flares&quot; (see <a href=\"#H528967652\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In one study, for example, 12 percent of patients with hypocomplementemia and elevated anti-DNA antibody titers had no clinical evidence of active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>There are also clinical features that are associated with an increased risk of SLE flare. These include diagnosis of SLE before age 25 as well as patients who have renal, vasculitic, or neurologic involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/49,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,53</a>].</p><p>Thus, we favor an approach in which such patients are closely monitored, and therapy is adjusted if there are signs of clinical worsening of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H924035\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several nonpharmacologic measures and other medical interventions are important in the comprehensive management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in addition to the specific medication regimens.

Thus, patients should avoid exposure to direct or reflected sunlight, and other sources of UV light (eg, fluorescent and halogen lights). Sunscreens that block both UV-A and UV-B, and have a sun protection factor (SPF) &ge;55, are suggested. Medications that can cause photosensitivity should also be avoided in patients with SLE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62152 \">table 1</a>).

A steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) is often required to control symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Patients with severe or life-threatening manifestations secondary to major organ involvement (eg, renal and central nervous system) generally require an initial period of intensive immunosuppressive therapy (induction therapy) to control the disease and halt tissue injury. Patients are usually treated for a short period of time with high doses of systemic glucocorticoids (eg, 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or equivalent or intermittent intravenous &quot;pulses&quot; of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>) used alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>). This initial therapy is subsequently followed by a longer period of less intensive and, ideally, less toxic maintenance therapy to consolidate remission and prevent flares. During this phase of treatment, the dose of prednisone or equivalent is reduced while monitoring clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SLE can run a varied clinical course, ranging from a relatively benign illness to a rapidly progressive disease with fulminant organ failure and death. Clinical remission after appropriate therapy is uncommon, and, when it is achieved, it is often not sustained. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Clinical remission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor prognostic factors for survival in SLE include renal disease (especially diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis), hypertension, male sex, younger or older age at presentation, low socioeconomic status, black race, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and high overall disease activity. (See <a href=\"#H84665347\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SLE have mortality rates ranging from 2 to 5 times higher than that of the general population. The major causes of death in the first few years of illness are active disease (eg, central nervous system [CNS] and renal) or infection due to immunosuppression, while causes of late death include complications of SLE (eg, endstage renal disease), treatment complications, and cardiovascular disease. Patients are also at risk for significant morbidity due to both active disease and the side effects of drugs such as glucocorticoids and cytotoxic agents. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Causes of death'</a> above and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the overall risk of death due to malignancy does not appear to be increased in SLE patients, the risk of death due to specific malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is significantly increased among SLE patients when compared with the general population. (See <a href=\"#H84666354\" class=\"local\">'Is cancer risk increased?'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">van Vollenhoven RF, Mosca M, Bertsias G, et al.
