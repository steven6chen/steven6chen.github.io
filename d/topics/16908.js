Exposure to <span class=\"nowrap\">television/media</span> violence is an important and ubiquitous risk factor for youth violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the violence depicted is &quot;virtual&quot; in that the child does not witness it in person, the violence often affects real people (eg, news reports) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pediatric care providers and parents can work together to decrease the exposure of children to media violence (primary prevention) and, if exposed, to mitigate the effects (secondary prevention).</p><p>In broad terms, the impact of any influence on health behaviors is the product of the number of persons exposed and the magnitude of the effect of the exposure. This review first explores the ubiquity of exposure of children to television violence, then reviews studies that have established the negative consequences of this exposure, and concludes with suggestions for clinical interventions. Much of the research reviewed was conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, when the influence of media exposure on children was first established. Since then, the variety of media available has exploded, although there is no reason to believe that the exposure has decreased.</p><p>The association between viewing violence and subsequent violent behavior and prevention of the consequences of media violence are reviewed here. Other types of violence are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peer-violence-and-violence-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peer violence and violence prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-childhood-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Childhood exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">QUANTITY OF MEDIA VIOLENCE EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children &ge;8 years of age and adolescents in the United States spend an average of &gt;2 hours per day watching television, and at least six hours per day when all types of media are included (eg, movies, videos, digital music, <span class=\"nowrap\">video/computer/mobile</span> games, social media, digital devices, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Children's television is the most violent genre of programming. Whereas violent acts (acts intended to injure or harm others) appear 8 to 12 times per hour on prime-time television, cartoons often show 25 to 50 violent acts per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Movies are another source of violent content, and viewing gun use in movies may increase interest in guns in the real world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a review of 77 movies from 1999 and 2000 that were rated PG-13, nearly 90 percent had violent content, and firearms were used in nearly one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overall, 2251 acts of violence were observed, 47 percent of which were of lethal magnitude. Seven movies contained more than 100 acts of violence. In another review of 61 G- and PG-rated movies released between 1998 and 2002, 28 percent included characters with guns, 48 percent depicted gun threats, and guns were discharged in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the consequences of gun use (injury and death) were rarely portrayed. Depictions of gun violence in the top grossing PG-13-rated films have increased since 1985, and since 2009 have been as frequent or more frequent than in the top-grossing R-rated films [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A survey of 6522 United States adolescents aged 10 to 14 years in 2003 indicated that 12.5 percent had seen at least 1 of 40 movies that were rated R for violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Media violence is without consequence'</a> below.)</p><p>Music videos and video games are additional sources of violent content. In a review of 518 music videos broadcast on television, 462 acts of overt interpersonal violence were portrayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Content analysis of 81 randomly selected video games for teenagers found that 98 percent involved intentional violence, 90 percent rewarded or required the player to injure other characters, and 69 percent rewarded or required the player to kill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the data associating video game use with actual violent behavior remain controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A 2016 statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Communications advises that most experts in the field agree on the potential harms of exposure to all forms of screen violence and states that &quot;first-person shooter games, in which killing others is the central theme, are not appropriate for any children&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The average American child who spends two-thirds of his or her television time watching prime-time television programs and one-third watching cartoons views 10,000 to 12,000 violent acts per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. American children see an estimated 8000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence by the time they finish grade school and twice that many by the time they reach 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A random survey of 1051 families conducted in 2005 by the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrated the continued early and consistent use of television by American families. Over 40 percent of infants less than one year old watch television daily; this proportion climbs to 80 percent by age two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. More recent survey data indicate that regular screen use is initiated at age four months, and children younger than two years average over one hour of screen time daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PROBLEMATIC CHARACTERISTICS OF MEDIA VIOLENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of viewing violence depends upon the amount, the context in which it is seen, and the social message that accompanies the presentation. Although violence is portrayed in other media (eg, song lyrics, music videos, movies), television violence is best studied. On-demand television and video streaming over the internet have increased the availability of media access. Regardless of how it is delivered, <span class=\"nowrap\">television/media</span> violence is understandable to preverbal and preliterate children because it does not rely on verbal or written language. <span class=\"nowrap\">Television/media</span> violence differs from real violence in ways that affect its impact on children and adolescents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Media violence is socially acceptable</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Violence is used more often than patience, negotiation, or compromise to resolve conflict in the media. It is portrayed as an effective, socially acceptable, and normative way to solve problems, is used by heroes as well as villains, and often is rewarded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/5,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,21</a>]. In the study of music videos described above, for example, the protagonist of the video was the aggressor in 80 percent of the violent acts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Media violence is without consequence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Violence in the media has a variety of dramatic functions but is rarely seen as painful. In cartoons, violence is meant to be funny; the victim, however seriously injured, reappears intact after the commercial break. In other programs, heroes typically are spared the effects of violence, and villains, even if they are killed, rarely suffer. In the National Television Violence Study, for example, only 16 percent of violent programs showed long-term negative outcomes; 73 percent of violent acts were unpunished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In G- and PG-rated movies, injuries and deaths related to firearms are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This portrayal of violence without pain is internalized by children and adolescents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION BETWEEN VIEWING VIOLENCE AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childhood television viewing is associated with increased risk of subsequent violence. Despite their limitations, multiple studies have demonstrated this effect; taken together, they meet the epidemiologic criteria for causality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The socioeconomic status, parenting styles, size of family, and the quantity and quality of television viewing were among the variables studied. Compared with their peers, boys who were reported to view and prefer violent television programming at age eight were approximately twice as likely to be arrested for a violent crime by age 30 years. A weaker association was found between viewing television violence at age 18 years and subsequent violence history by age 30, suggesting that eight-year-old children are more susceptible to media violence than are 18-year-old adolescents. No relationship was found between aggressive behavior at age 8 and subsequent viewing of television violence at age 19.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This study is limited by the lack of randomization and experimental manipulation and the inability to control for potential confounding variables.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Population studies examined homicide trends in the United States, white South Africa, and Canada before, during, and after the introduction of television in each country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The homicide rate doubled in each of these countries 10 to 12 years after the introduction of television.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These studies are limited by their inability to control for other contemporary trends or events (eg, the Vietnam War, the struggle over apartheid) that might also account for the homicide trends.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a controlled trial, third- and fourth-grade children at one school received an 18-lesson, six-month curriculum to reduce television, videotape, and video game use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Compared with control children, children in the intervention school had decreased verbal aggression and decreased peer ratings of aggression.

In addition, in a randomized trial, preschool children whose parents were encouraged to substitute <span class=\"nowrap\">high-quality/educational</span> programming for aggression-laden programming (without reducing total screen time) and to watch the programs with their children for six months had a higher mean Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Finally, in observational studies, use of violent video games has been associated with a rise in salivary cortisol levels, as well as aggressive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Coherent explanation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The explanation to account for the association between viewing violence and subsequent violent conduct has two components. The first one is based upon the ways in which children learn how to behave.

In the first version, the film ends after the violence; in the second, the actor is rewarded after the attack; and in the third, the actor is punished after the attack. The children were led to a room containing an identical clown doll after they viewed the film. The children who saw the first and second versions of the film tended to attack the doll in the same way that the actor had. The children who saw the third version did not attack the doll as often.</p><p>Additional support is provided by comparison of the portrayal of violence in American and Japanese television. In Japan, where violence more often is perpetrated by the villain and the consequences of violence (eg, suffering for the hero) are emphasized, society is less violent than in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Media violence, including violent video games, systematically desensitizes young people to violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

They learn that objecting to violence may lead to more serious violence. They may resign themselves to violence, fail to seek help, and become more susceptible to becoming victims. Bystanders who feel that physical violence is a normal part of life encourage others to fight or refrain from intervening to prevent a fight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/television-and-media-violence/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

To the extent that children who witness aggressive solutions to interpersonal problems identify with the aggressive character, they fantasize about the aggressive behavior and remember the aggressive characters that they observe. The aggressive behavior then becomes habitual and interferes with social and academic success, leading to more regular television viewing, thus perpetuating a cycle of aggression, academic and social failure, violence viewing, and aggressive fantasizing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131064628\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF MEDIA VIOLENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2779061274\"><span class=\"h2\">News media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although news media coverage is primarily directed at adults, children and adolescents may view or hear coverage of violent news events, and children may be deeply affected by such vicarious trauma.

Children's television (particularly cartoons), movies, music videos, and video games are potential sources of violent content. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Quantity of media violence exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of viewing violence depends upon the amount, the context in which it is seen, and the social message that accompanies the presentation. Televised violence differs from real violence in ways that affect its impact on children and adolescents. Media violence often is perceived as socially acceptable and without consequence. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Problematic characteristics of media violence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite their limitations, multiple studies have demonstrated that childhood television viewing is associated with increased risk of subsequent violence by demonstrating a temporal relationship; consistency, strength, and specificity of the association; and a coherent explanation for the association. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Association between viewing violence and violent behavior'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual qualities of the viewer interact with the violence that is portrayed to produce a particular outcome in behavior. Some individuals are strongly affected by certain program elements, whereas other elements have no effect. The effect on individuals is influenced by temperamental and environmental variables. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Modulators of effects of violence viewing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects of increased exposure to media violence may include (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Other types of media'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased tendency to behave violently toward others (aggressor effect)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased fearfulness of becoming a victim, with a resultant increase in self-protective behavior</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased callousness and desensitization toward actual violence (bystander effect)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A cycle in which aggressive children who watch television violence identify with violent characters, act like those characters, and seek out more and more violent programming</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric care providers can address the problem of media violence and associated violent behavior at three levels: the family, the community and school, and the legislative and regulatory approaches.
