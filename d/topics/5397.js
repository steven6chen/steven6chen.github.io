Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs all over the body that make and store cells that fight infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63854 \">figure 1</a>). These infection-fighting cells are also called &quot;white blood cells.&quot;</p><p>When people have DLBCL, their white blood cells become abnormal and grow out of control. These cells can travel to different parts of the body. Often, the abnormal cells collect in small, bean-shaped organs called lymph nodes. This causes the lymph nodes to swell.</p><p>DLBCL is a common type of lymphoma and usually happens in older people. It grows quickly, so it needs to be treated quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606340\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of DLBCL?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with DLBCL first notice one or more swollen lymph nodes. These swollen nodes are often in the neck, groin, or belly. You might be able to feel them under the skin but they are usually not painful. People with DLBCL can also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Night sweats that soak their clothes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606347\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for DLBCL?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lymph node biopsy &ndash; A doctor will remove one of the swollen lymph nodes. Then another doctor will look at the cells under a microscope to see if cancer cells are present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606354\"><span class=\"h1\">What is lymphoma staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoma staging is a way in which doctors find out how far the lymphoma has spread in the lymphatic system or in the body. The right treatment for you depends a lot on the stage of your lymphoma.</p><p>To find out how far your DLBCL has spread, your doctor will do an exam, blood tests, and an imaging test, such as a CT or PET scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. </p><p>Your doctor might also do a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, a doctor will take a small sample of bone marrow (the tissue in the center of your bones). Another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606361\"><span class=\"h1\">How is DLBCL treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with DLBCL are usually treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called &quot;immunotherapy&quot; &ndash; These medicines kill cancer cells by recognizing the cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p>All people with DLBCL get chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Some people will also get radiation therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606368\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check to see if your DLBCL is gone. He or she will talk with you and do an exam, blood tests, and an imaging test. He or she might also do another bone marrow biopsy. </p><p>If your doctor does not see cancer in your blood or body, then he or she will check every so often to see if the DLBCL has come back. Regular follow-ups will include talking with your doctor and having exams. Sometimes, your doctor will also do blood tests and imaging tests. </p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above, such as swollen lymph nodes, fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have those symptoms, because having those symptoms could mean that the cancer has come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606375\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the DLBCL comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the DLBCL comes back, or if it never went away after treatment, you might have more chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant is a treatment that replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation. It is also called a &quot;stem cell transplant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606382\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for DLBCL involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when. </p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks to this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5606389\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lymphoma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
