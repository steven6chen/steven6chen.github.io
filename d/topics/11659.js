Within this category, tumors from many primary sites with varying biology are represented. Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) constitute less than 5 percent of all CUPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Several types of these neoplasms (eg, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the tubular gastrointestinal tract [previously referred to as carcinoid tumors] and pancreas [pancreatic NETs or PNETs], medullary thyroid cancers, pheochromocytomas) are characterized by slow growth and frequent secretion of hormones or vasoactive substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In most cases, these tumors also have typical histologic appearance and are accurately diagnosed with standard pathologic methods (light microscopy and immunohistochemical staining). Others, as typified by small cell carcinoma of the lung, are highly aggressive neoplasms, classified as neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), and are usually advanced when diagnosed.

Although differences exist, all systems separate NENs on the basis of tumor grade (assessed by mitotic rate and Ki-67 index) and differentiation into two broad categories: well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs; indolent), which are mostly low or intermediate grade, and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), which are high grade and aggressive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60365 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-differentiated NETs are subdivided in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system into low grade (grade 1) and intermediate grade (grade 2) according to proliferative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The term &quot;atypical carcinoid&quot; is reserved for an intermediate-grade NET arising in the lung. Clinical behavior of grade 1 and 2 NETs is relatively indolent, and the management considerations are similar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly differentiated NECs are high-grade tumors. Some of these have histology similar to small cell carcinoma of the lung; a large cell neuroendocrine variant also exists. Some poorly differentiated NECs lack morphologic features of neuroendocrine differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Diagnosis of these cancers depends on immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> synaptophysin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H463615391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Pathologic diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In recognition of the fact that a subset of high-grade NENs are well differentiated and have a prognosis that is better than high-grade poorly differentiated NECs but worse than intermediate-grade well-differentiated NETs, the updated 2017 WHO classification for tumors of endocrine organs now classifies well-differentiated pancreatic NETs as grade 1 (PanNET G1), grade 2 (PanNET G2), or grade 3 (PanNET G3), and the terminology for high-grade poorly differentiated tumors is &quot;PanNEC G3&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the grade 3 well-differentiated tumor category is not yet formally recognized by the WHO for NENs of the stomach and intestines, we consider it reasonable to apply the term &quot;NET G3&quot; to all well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic NETs with Ki-67 index &gt;20 percent (typically in the 20 to 55 percent range).</p><p/><p>When a NEN is recognized histologically in a patient presenting with cancer of unknown primary site (CUP), the majority are well differentiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, high-grade NENs presenting as CUP are often recognized histologically only as undifferentiated or poorly differentiated small cell carcinoma, and the definitive diagnosis of a neuroendocrine origin is made only after immunohistochemical stains are performed.&nbsp;As noted above, in one prospective database of 1340 NENs reported over a one-year period by French pathologists, 190 were classified as of unknown primary site, and 44 percent of these were poorly differentiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Poorly differentiated NECs are characterized by multiple sites of metastases, and they rarely produce symptoms related to secretion of bioactive substances. Accurate distinction of well-differentiated, indolent tumors from poorly differentiated, aggressive tumors is important since treatment approaches are different. (See <a href=\"#H7120407\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and management'</a> below.)</p><p>NENs of unknown primary site, especially the well-differentiated NETs, often present initially with liver metastases, and most of these represent gastroenteropancreatic NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Histologic grade may be the only prognostic parameter available for this group of metastatic tumors. The uniform grading scheme for gastroenteropancreatic tumors, as established by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) and the WHO in 2010, applies to this category unless a different primary site (eg, the pancreas) is found (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60365 \">table 2</a>). The updated grading schema for pancreatic NENs from the WHO is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Just as immunohistochemistry and molecular cancer classifier assay (MCCA) can aid in identifying a tumor as having a neuroendocrine origin, these tests may also help to localize the site of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>TTF-1</em> is expressed in most poorly differentiated NECs and some well-differentiated NETs of lung origin.

The biologic behavior of these two entities differs remarkably, and the distinction is important for planning therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In recognition of the fact that a subset of high-grade NENs are well differentiated, the updated 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification for tumors of endocrine organs now classifies well-differentiated pancreatic NETs as grade 1 (PanNET G1), grade 2 (PanNET G2), or grade 3 (PanNET G3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the grade 3 well-differentiated tumor category is not yet formally recognized by the WHO for NENs of the stomach and intestines, we consider it reasonable to apply the term &quot;NET G3&quot; to all well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic NETs with Ki-67 index &gt;20 percent (typically in the 20 to 55 percent range).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most well-differentiated NETs of unknown primary site present with liver metastases. In some patients, the primary site is subsequently identified in the intestinal tract or the pancreas. Patients with mesenteric masses on imaging scans and no evidence of disease on upper or lower endoscopy can be considered to have small intestinal primary tumors and should be treated according to guidelines for small intestinal NETs. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The initial evaluation of these patients should include cross-sectional imaging, usually with multiphase computed tomography (CT), and somatostatin receptor imaging to assist with primary localization. Where available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> is preferred over somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (OctreoScan) because of its greater sensitivity. If a primary site cannot be identified through these imaging modalities, upper and lower endoscopy (with attention to the terminal ileum) should be performed. Immunohistochemical stains and a 92-gene molecular cancer classifier assay (MCCA) may help in determining the tissue of origin. Endoscopic ultrasonography can be used to rule out an occult pancreatic primary tumor. (See <a href=\"#H1146371\" class=\"local\">'Initial workup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who have symptoms suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, elevated urinary levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) are highly specific for serotonin-producing NETs (eg, those arising in the small bowel). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome and tumor localization&quot;, section on 'Biochemical testing for the carcinoid syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a primary site cannot be identified, we recommend that these patients be managed like those with metastatic well-differentiated nonpancreatic NETs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7121028\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-systemic-therapy-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic well-differentiated gastrointestinal neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors: Systemic therapy options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with high-grade poorly differentiated NECs generally have biologically aggressive tumors. Most either present with or rapidly develop disseminated disease. The initial evaluation should include cross-sectional imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scanning. (See <a href=\"#H1146364\" class=\"local\">'Initial workup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We recommend first-line treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, following treatment guidelines for small and large cell NECs of the lung (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
