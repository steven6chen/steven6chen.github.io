If your school has a nurse, he or she will be the main person. If not, another staff member can be the main person. If this person does not know how to take care of diabetes, he or she will need to learn how.</p><p>Your child can also help manage his or her diabetes in school. As your child gets older, he or she can do more and more to manage it. But even if your child manages the diabetes on his or her own, a staff member at school should know about it and be ready to help in case of a diabetes emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056108\"><span class=\"h1\">What should the school do to manage my child's diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The school should work with you and your child's diabetes team to make a written plan. This plan will list all the ways that the school will manage your child's diabetes. The school should let you know if they have questions about your child's diabetes or if any new problems come up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056123\"><span class=\"h1\">What information should be in my child's school plan?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's school plan should have information about how to take care of the diabetes day to day. It should also have information about how to treat problems or emergencies that might happen. The plan should include information from both you and your child's doctor about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child's medicines &ndash; This should include all the medicines your child takes, where they are kept, and when and how they are given. The timing and dosing of your child's insulin are especially important.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child's meals and snacks &ndash; For example, the plan might list foods that your child should or shouldn't eat. If your child needs to eat on a schedule, it can list the times and amounts that he or she should eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking your child's blood sugar level &ndash; The plan should discuss who will check your child's blood sugar, and when and how it will be checked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that could mean your child's blood sugar level is too low or too high &ndash; Let the school know which symptoms to watch for.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to treat a blood sugar level that is too low or too high, including when to get emergency help</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to reach you, another family member, and your child's doctor in case of an emergency</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to safely include your child in physical activities, school parties, field trips, and other special events</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child's other needs &ndash; For example, your child might need to leave class at certain times of the day to take insulin, use the bathroom, or eat a snack.</p><p/><p>The person who manages your child's diabetes in school should share this plan with the other school staff. He or she should tell them how your child's diabetes will be managed, which symptoms to watch for, and what to do in case of an emergency.</p><p>Every year before the school year starts, you and the school should review your child's plan. You might need to change the plan as your child gets older.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056138\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to help the school manage my child's diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help the school manage your child's diabetes, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bring in the diabetes supplies that your child will need at school &ndash; This can include daily medicines, blood testing supplies, and emergency medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leave food or snacks for your child at school &ndash; You might want to make up snack bags that the school can give your child if his or her blood sugar gets too low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer to teach the staff and students about diabetes and how it is managed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Share information about your child's health with the school and let them know if anything changes with your child's diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056153\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By law (in the United States), most schools must meet the needs of children with diabetes. If your school has a problem meeting your child's needs, talk with your child's doctor or nurse.
