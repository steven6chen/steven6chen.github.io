Damage to the chest wall may coincide with significant injury to certain of these internal structures and thus, warrants careful evaluation.</p><p>The evaluation and initial management of chest wall injuries in adults will be reviewed here. Rib fractures, clavicle fractures, internal thoracic injuries, and general trauma management are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clavicle-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clavicle fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15009018\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpreting the literature about the epidemiology of chest wall trauma is problematic. Most studies use data from trauma registries, which primarily involve patients admitted to the hospital with significant injuries. Patients with minor injuries or an isolated rib fracture are often discharged, leading to a bias in the literature toward the more seriously injured. As a result, the epidemiology of minor chest wall injuries (eg, muscle contusion and strains) is largely unknown. Many patients with such injuries do not present to the medical system at the time of injury. Therefore, available information is largely retrospective or obtained about patients with other more serious injuries.</p><p>Nevertheless, available studies provide some insight. Several studies of chest trauma from motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) report that rib fractures are identified in nearly two-thirds of admitted patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Sternal fractures are found in up to 8 percent of blunt chest trauma patients and 18 percent of multiple trauma patients with thoracic injuries, and are usually the result of a direct, high-energy blow to the sternum from the steering wheel and column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Although life-saving in many instances, over-the-shoulder seat belts contribute to these fractures and their incidence has risen with the increased use of these seat belts. The incidence is greater among passengers in older cars where occupants wear seat belts but air bags are not available.</p><p>Scapular fractures account for only 1 percent of all fractures and less than 5 percent of fractures to the shoulder complex; they occur in up to 3.7 percent of blunt trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. As scapular fractures generally require great force, over 90 percent are associated with other significant injuries, including rib fracture, pneumothorax, and pulmonary contusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Scapular fractures rarely cause blunt aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although the reasons are unclear, in one large prospective study scapula fractures were associated with lower mortality compared with similarly injured patients without them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15009025\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy and physiology of the thorax and the mechanisms of blunt and penetrating thoracic trauma are discussed in detail separately. Elements of particular importance to chest wall trauma are briefly described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and mechanism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H4933688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Anatomy, pathophysiology, and mechanism'</a>.)</p><p>The chest wall consists primarily of skin, bones (including the thoracic spine, scapulae, clavicles, sternum, and ribs), costal cartilage, and muscles of the chest and back (including the pectoralis major and minor, intercostals, trapezius, latissimus, rhomboids, and paraspinals). Neurovascular bundles composed of an intercostal nerve, artery, and vein, run along the inferior portion of each rib. Parietal pleura lines the inside of the chest wall. </p><p>The anterior chest wall contains the sternum and pectoralis major and minor muscles, as well as the clavicle at its superior border. Posteriorly, the scapula provides added protection to the superior thorax. The scapula is a dense bone encased in muscle and significant force is necessary to fracture it. High-speed motor vehicle collisions (MVC) and falls from height are common mechanisms. Greater force is necessary to fracture the sternum of a healthy adult. This may occur during a MVC when a driver&rsquo;s chest strikes the steering wheel or steering column or with sudden forceful restraint from an across-the-chest seat belt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/5,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,15</a>]. The majority of sternal fractures are associated with significant overall injury severity; the most common associated injuries are rib fractures, pulmonary contusions, pneumothoraces, and thoracolumbar vertebral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Sternal fractures are an isolated injury in approximately one quarter of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Chest wall injuries that are associated with increased risk of significant intrathoracic or intraabdominal injury include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scapula fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flail chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple rib fractures (&ge;3) and displaced rib fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sternal fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior sternoclavicular dislocation</p><p/><p>The functions of the chest wall are twofold: to assist in the mechanics of respiration and to protect the vital intrathoracic organs. While chest wall structures protect against more devastating injuries, they are commonly injured while doing so. Such chest wall injuries are not usually life-threatening, but can be extremely painful and may lead to significant morbidity if not recognized and treated appropriately.</p><p>Blunt chest trauma can occur through a variety of mechanisms; common examples include MVCs, assaults, and falls. Particularly in the elderly, apparently minor trauma (eg, fall from standing) can cause serious injury. Rib fractures, flail chest, and chest wall contusion can occur from any of the above mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Flail chest'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15009032\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important consideration in the adult with chest wall injuries is the possibility of significant intrathoracic or intra-abdominal injury. The evaluation and management of such internal injuries is discussed separately.

A patient with concern for underlying pulmonary, cardiac, mediastinal, or major extrathoracic injury is treated according to the principles of advanced trauma life support&trade; (ATLS&trade;), with special attention paid to the airway, breathing, and circulation. Otherwise, alert patients with signs of chest wall injury but no evidence of respiratory or circulatory compromise or significant internal injury are generally taken directly to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation with minimal prehospital intervention other than direct transport. Prehospital management of the trauma patient is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15009046\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15009055\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation of the adult with chest wall trauma is based upon the patient's vital signs and clinical presentation, and the mechanism of injury. In general, abnormal vital signs are more predictive of severe injury than mechanism following blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hemodynamically unstable patients are resuscitated in accordance with the basic principles of ATLS&trade;, with the emphasis on assessment and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. The evaluation and management of the trauma patient, including those with severe blunt or penetrating chest trauma, is discussed separately. The following discussion addresses patients without respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability who have sustained blunt trauma to the chest wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15009062\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the evaluation of chest wall trauma lies in rapidly excluding serious injury to internal structures. Depending upon the presentation, this can be accomplished with a focused history and physical examination or it may require multiple tests, including plain chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography.</p><p>The initial question is whether the patient is at low or high-risk of internal injury. Vital signs and mental status are the most important factor in making this determination. Additional factors include the patient's chief complaint and general appearance, signs of injury identified on physical examination, and the mechanism of injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929690\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>While high-energy trauma correlates with increased risk of internal injury, the significance of the mechanism can be difficult to determine. As an example, a young healthy adult with a major mechanism (eg, roll-over motor vehicle collision [MVC]) may have no injuries, while a frail older adult patient can sustain life-threatening injuries by simply falling to the ground. Nevertheless, certain mechanisms warrant more extensive evaluation. As an example, patients with significant falls (&gt;3 m [10 feet]) or high-impact collisions are at higher risk of aortic injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Mechanism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Aortic injury'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The trauma patient should be completely undressed so the entire chest and back can be properly examined. Careful inspection is important. Note the patient&rsquo;s respiratory rate and effort; look for asymmetric motion or accessory muscle use during respiration. Inspect the chest wall for signs of injury such as a seat-belt sign or hematoma. Findings such as contusions or an imprint from a steering wheel or an ecchymotic anterior chest raise concern for underlying pulmonary or aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Palpate the entire chest wall for areas of tenderness or deformity. Patients with pain and tenderness along the lower ribs, especially when associated with abdominal pain, are at higher risk for intraabdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Keep the examination room warm to help prevent hypothermia. </p><p>Physical findings of chest wall trauma that are consistent with intrathoracic or intraabdominal injury include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxia or signs of respiratory difficulty (eg, accessory muscle use)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paradoxical movement of a chest segment during respiration (suggesting flail chest)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic instability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seat belt sign across the chest or abdominal wall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness over multiple rib segments (suggesting multiple rib fractures)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpable depression or deformity of sternum or multiple rib segments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal tenderness or guarding</p><p/><p>Patients with any of these findings need appropriate management and further diagnostic imaging.

Depending upon the clinical scenario, initial imaging typically includes a standard trauma ultrasound examination (ie, eFAST), while advanced imaging generally involves a chest CT. The management of these patients, including the appropriate use and interpretation of imaging studies is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929775\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic studies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Chest radiograph'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Chest CT: Indications, accuracy, and decision rules'</a>.) </p><p>In hemodynamically unstable patients and many stable patients with chest wall trauma, a standardized ultrasound examination (ie, eFAST) is performed. In the setting of chest wall trauma, ultrasound is particularly important for identifying life-threatening injuries such as pericardial tamponade and pneumothorax. Ultrasound may also be useful for identifying hemothorax, rib fractures, and cardiac injuries in patients with chest trauma, but such investigations are not part of the standard ultrasound examination of trauma patients. The role and performance of the ultrasound examination in adult chest and abdominal trauma is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In hemodynamically stable patients for whom a chest CT is planned, it is not necessary to obtain a routine plain chest x-ray (CXR) prior to CT. CT is more sensitive than plain x-ray for all injuries in patients with chest trauma. However, among patients with isolated chest wall trauma, CT is only indicated if the detection of an injury, such as multiple displaced rib fractures or an occult pneumothorax, will alter management. As an example, a geriatric patient with multiple rib fractures would be admitted for close monitoring and aggressive pulmonary toilet. For most patients with isolated chest wall trauma, a CXR is sufficient to detect any clinically significant injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The CXR provides much useful information while exposing the patient to little radiation and we suggest it be obtained for any patient with concerning chest wall trauma. A CXR is not necessary when injuries are clearly limited to the superficial soft tissues and the patient is otherwise stable. Dedicated rib x-rays (ie, rib series) are rarely indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures#H15520654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Chest radiographs'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3118412\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed on all patients with significant blunt chest trauma. Patients with minor trauma remote from the central or left side of the chest may not need an ECG, but this should be determined by the clinician after a careful history and examination. ECG findings related to blunt cardiac injury are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac injury from blunt trauma&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15009069\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS, INITIAL MANAGEMENT, AND DISPOSITION OF SPECIFIC INJURIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3120151\"><span class=\"h2\">Minor chest wall injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor injuries of the chest wall are usually identified during the physical examination. Patients with such injuries to the chest wall, including bone and muscle contusions, and no signs of other significant injury following an appropriate work-up may be discharged. Discharged patients should be warned to return immediately to the emergency department (ED) for any concerning symptoms, such as shortness of breath or a sudden increase in pain. However, among patients with minor chest wall injuries but no rib fracture or underlying pulmonary disease the risk of developing pneumonia appears to be extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients should be warned that pain may persist for some time following trauma. According to one observational study, up to 19 percent of patients with minor chest wall injuries experienced pain for months after the trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-chest-wall-trauma-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2445769\"><span class=\"h2\">Clavicle fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with clavicle fractures often complain of pain exacerbated by shoulder movement and deformity of the clavicle. However, deformity may be absent and diagnosis correspondingly more difficult with fractures involving the proximal or distal third of the bone. The diagnosis and management of clavicle fractures is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and examination'</a>.) </p><p>Patients with multiple rib fractures (&ge;3), particularly elders, or displaced rib fractures generally warrant admission due to the increased risk of potentially dangerous complications (eg, pulmonary contusion). Often, a thoracic CT is obtained to assess for internal injury in these patients.

This unstable section of chest wall exhibits paradoxical motion (ie, it moves in the opposite direction of the uninjured, normal-functioning chest wall) with breathing, and is associated with significant morbidity from pulmonary contusion. Abnormal motion can be difficult to detect making the diagnosis difficult, but these patients generally experience significant pain and at least some respiratory difficulty. Patients with flail chest are admitted to the hospital.

Palpation reveals tenderness and occasionally bony crepitance or deformity. Anterior chest wall ecchymosis is also common. Sternal fractures are associated with an increased risk of internal injury. Such injuries may include rib fractures, myocardial contusion, hemopericardium, spinal fractures, retrosternal hematoma, hemothorax, pneumothorax, and trauma to major vessels. Therefore, further work-up is required.

The usual mechanism is a direct, high-velocity blow to the medial clavicle or medial compression of the shoulder girdle. Posterior dislocations can be dangerous, potentially causing damage to the trachea, lung, or subclavian vessels, and warrant careful evaluation including imaging and urgent reduction. The initial evaluation and management of SC dislocations is discussed separately.

Palpation may reveal tenderness. Scapular fractures involve significant force and should raise suspicion for internal trauma, including intrathoracic injuries, spine fractures, and spleen and liver lacerations. A thorough trauma evaluation is warranted if a scapula fracture is identified.
