This has been hypothesized to be attributable, in part, to variable pharmacodynamic efficacy of one or both agents. Patients with &quot;high on-treatment platelet reactivity&rdquo; (HPR) have been labeled as being nonresponsive, hyporesponsive, or resistant. Numerous observational studies have demonstrated a strong link between stented patients with HPR and recurrent ischemic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The approach to such patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is presented separately.

In studies employing light transmittance aggregometry, a change in maximal aggregation &le;10 percent from baseline, using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) as the agonist, is defined as &quot;resistance.&quot; &quot;Resistance&quot; has also been inappropriately used interchangeably with &quot;non-responsiveness&quot; or &quot;hypo-responsiveness&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The degree of change from baseline in platelet function (responsiveness) has also been categorized into varies degrees. For example, &quot;non-responsive&quot; (&le;10 percent), &quot;hypo-responsive&quot; (10 to 20 percent), and responsive (&gt;20 percent). </p><p><strong>Heightened platelet reactivity (HPR)</strong>, also called <strong>high on-treatment platelet reactivity</strong>, to ADP during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> therapy indicates persistent response of the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor (clopidogrel target). It is based on one measurement of on-treatment platelet reactivity. Usually, the cut points of HPR have been linked to clinical risk of thrombosis based on non-randomized comparisons of stented patients. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clopidogrel</a><strong> treatment failure</strong> is best defined as the occurrence of a thrombotic <span class=\"nowrap\">event/ischemic</span> event during clopidogrel therapy in patients with HPR. Treatment failure may result from patient noncompliance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate response to the antiplatelet action of clopidogrel. As multiple signaling pathways mediate platelet activation and the occurrence of thrombotic events, a treatment strategy directed against a single pathway, cannot be expected to prevent the occurrence of all events. </p><p>In addition, not all ischemic clinical events in patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> are associated with clopidogrel failure. For example, a patient taking clopidogrel after stenting may have a new ischemic event attributable to plaque rupture at a site remote from the prior stent procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7651360\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND TIME COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been estimated that between 16 and 50 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> have high on treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. HPR is dependent on the cut-off value used for each assay: the higher the cut-off, the lower the percent of patients with HPR. In addition, poor biologic response is determined by factors other than HPR. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Potential explanations'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clopidogrel</a> response variability was initially demonstrated by measuring adenosine diphosphate-induced (ADP) platelet aggregation, as well as p-selectin and activated <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> expression, at baseline and serially for 30 days after stenting in patients treated with a 300 mg clopidogrel load followed by 75 mg daily therapy. Some patients had no demonstrable antiplatelet effect; when the absolute difference between pre- and post-treatment platelet aggregation was &le;10 percent, patients were labelled regarded as &ldquo;resistant&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence of resistant patients was 31 percent at day five post-stenting, and it fell to 15 percent at day 30. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87715\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87715 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>In addition, the level of platelet reactivity early after a standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> regimen for coronary stenting was directly related to the pre-treatment reactivity. One study found that patients treated with clopidogrel (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a>) who were hyper-responsive to ADP before treatment were likely to be hyper-responsive to ADP during platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In a study of 60 patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 25 percent of patents were found to be resistant to clopidogrel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A reduction in platelet reactivity over time (after initiation of therapy) has been observed in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], studies. For example, two studies have shown a decrease in the prevalence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity of up to 50 percent at day 30 compared to day one post-stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Approximately 85 percent of absorbed clopidogrel is hydrolyzed by human carboxylesterase-1 into an inactive carboxylic acid metabolite, and 15 percent is metabolized into an active metabolite by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP). Hepatic biotransformation involves a two-step oxidative process. In the first step, the thiophene ring of clopidogrel is oxidized to form 2-oxo-clopidogrel by CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6. In the second step, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 catalyze the formation of the active metabolite (<em>R</em>-130964). It has been proposed that CYP2C19 is the major enzyme involved in the generation of clopidogrel active metabolite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Among several polymorphisms of CYP2C19, the two most frequent variants associated with loss-of-function (LoF<em> </em>SNPs) are CYP2C19*2<em>, </em>a G681A mutation in exon 5 resulting in an aberrant splice site leading to the production of a truncated, non-functioning protein and CYP2C19*3, a G636A mutation in exon 4 resulting in a premature stop codon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].

Although the influence of these interactions on clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been reported, no prospective study has conclusively demonstrated the clinically meaningful influence of these drugs in patients treated with clopidogrel. </p><p>In addition, demographic variables such as age, renal failure, diabetes, and body mass index also influence the platelet response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by either directly affecting platelet function or by affecting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> metabolism. The final platelet reactivity phenotype and clinical outcomes of patients treated with clopidogrel is the result of all of these influences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The following drugs have been implicated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Statins</strong> &ndash; Although some studies have suggested a possible association between lipid soluble statin administration and pharmacodynamic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, the clinical relevance of these pharmacodynamics findings has not been demonstrated. Although such a relationship may be explained by the fact that some statins are metabolized by some of the same pathways as clopidogrel, the totality of evidence suggests that clinicians need not preferentially prescribe any particular statin with coadministration of clopidogrel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].

It should be noted that such cut-points may depend on the subset of patients studied. In fact, cut-off values have been mainly investigated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and different targets may be obtained in other settings depending on patient management or baseline risk profile.

Some studies suggested that the prognostic value of HPR can be improved by the addition of classical clinical and procedural risk factors and suggested that a comprehensive algorithm including clinical as well as laboratory findings (platelet reactivity and genotype) should be considered in future personalized antiplatelet therapy investigations to optimize outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/115,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,116</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88680480\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of screening for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo-/non-responsiveness</span> (also referred to as &quot;resistance&quot;) is controversial. In the absence of results from well performed randomized trials designed to evaluate this issue, we do not perform <strong>routine</strong> testing of patients for clopidogrel resistance, whether by ex vivo tests of platelet function or by genetic testing to predict CYP2C19 metabolic state and identify poor metabolizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/105,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,117</a>]. </p><p>We recognize that some experts recommend routine testing based on biological plausibility, an understanding of the pharmacodynamic effects of antiplatelet drugs, and the large body of observational data linking specific genotypes and high on treatment platelet reactivity to thrombotic event occurrence in patients treated with coronary artery stents. </p><p>There is evidence that does not support screening. The ARCTIC-Monitoring trial randomly assigned 2440 patients (approximately one-third has an acute coronary syndrome) scheduled for coronary stenting to either a strategy of platelet-function monitoring or no monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].

In the monitoring group, platelet-function testing was performed for both P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blockers (and aspirin) using the VerifyNow assay both before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and at 14 to 30 days. If high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel therapy started at least six hours before stent implantation was found, the protocol called for the administration of a glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitor and an additional loading dose of clopidogrel (at a dose &ge;600 mg) or a loading dose of prasugrel (at a dose of 60 mg) before the procedure, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 150 mg of clopidogrel or 10 mg of prasugrel. In the monitoring group, patients with high platelet reactivity during treatment with clopidogrel were switched to prasugrel 10 mg daily or received a 75 mg increase in the maintenance dose. In the monitoring group, high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel (which was used in approximately 90 percent of patients) occurred in 34.5 percent of patients. There was no difference in the rate of the primary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularization at one year) between the monitoring and no monitoring groups (34.6 versus 31.1 percent). Similarly, in a secondary (landmark) analysis that evaluated the primary outcome starting at the time of hospital discharge rather than at the time of the procedure, there was no difference between the groups at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. </p><p>There were limitations to this study.

Similar to GRAVITAS, the primary intervention in the maintenance phase among patients with HPR was clopidogrel 150 mg once daily, 15.6 percent of the patients in the monitoring group had HPR at two to four weeks follow-up despite monitoring, and the study population was at low absolute risk for cardiovascular events.

In a time-dependent analysis of GRAVITAS, &lt;208 PRU was independently associated with the 60 days primary end point (HR 0.23, 95% C: 0.05-0.98) and tended to be an independent predictor at six months (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.28-1.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Only a minority of patients receiving high-dose clopidogrel achieved &lt;208, indicating that high-dose clopidogrel regimen may have been sub-optimal and a more potent intervention that reduces HPR to a greater extent would have had greater potential to improve clinical outcomes given the very low event rate. In support of this hypothesis, the ELEVATE-TIMI (Escalating Clopidogrel by Involving a Genetic Strategy - Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) 56 trial showed that up to 225 mg of clopidogrel might be necessary to overcome HPR in patients carrying one loss-of-function cytochrome 2C19 gene (see below). GRAVITAS enrolled a population at low absolute risk for ischemic events despite displaying HPR. The majority of patients had stable angina, were successfully treated with PCI, and periprocedural events were not included in the primary end point. The tested pharmacologic intervention was administered more than 12 hours after PCI and the associated acute vessel <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/stent</span> deployment, which may have been too late to blunt a platelet-related incipient lesion. Finally, it is possible that a single platelet function test may not reliably reflect the effect of clopidogrel on ADP-induced platelet reactivity in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p>The ELEVATE PCI study demonstrated that 225 mg daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> is required to reduce platelet reactivity (&lt;50 platelet reactivity index as measured by VASP phosphorylation assay) in CYP2C19*2 heterozygotes to levels achieved with standard clopidogrel, 75 mg, in noncarriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].

In this study, the risk of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or stroke at one year was higher in the high-dose clopidogrel group compared to patients without HPR (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.45-3.55), whereas outcomes were similar between the prasugrel treated group and patients without HPR (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.44-1.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].
