In 1906, Howard Ricketts demonstrated that RMSF was an infectious disease transmitted by ticks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical spectrum of human infection ranges from mild to fulminant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of RMSF will be reviewed here. The basic biology of <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em> infection, the mechanisms of disease, and the treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630151\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiologic agent, <em>R. rickettsii</em>, is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium with a tropism for vascular endothelial cells. Rickettsial infection leads to direct vascular injury; endothelial cells produce prostaglandins that may contribute to increased vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Activation of clotting factors ensues, but true disseminated intravascular coagulation rarely occurs. Hyponatremia results from release of antidiuretic hormone as an appropriate response to hypovolemia and reduced tissue perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The host response, which is secondary to vascular injury, can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations such as interstitial pneumonitis, myocarditis, and encephalitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29024914\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. rickettsii</em> does not grow in cell-free culture media. Growth of <em>R. rickettsii</em> requires living host cells (such as the yolk sac of embryonated eggs or cell culture). Gimenez or acridine orange stains are required for visualization of rickettsia on microscopy, since they do not take up routine Gram stain; rickettsiae are also small in size (ie, 0.3 by 1.0 micrometers). The cell wall contains peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), similar to gram-negative bacteria. </p><p>Rickettsiae have surface proteins that are used for serotyping; these surface proteins (OmpA and OmpB) contain epitopes, which are the targets for humoral antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The rickettsial family of pathogens also includes the organisms in the spotted fever group (eg<em>, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia sibirica</em>). These additional organisms are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Other spotted fever group rickettsial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) occurs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and in parts of South America (Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia). The ease and frequency of interstate and international travel means that patients with RMSF acquired in endemic areas may present to clinicians practicing in locations where RMSF is uncommon or unknown. </p><p>RMSF is the most common rickettsial infection in the United States. In 2008, 2553 cases of RMSF were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2009, the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists changed the reporting designation from &quot;RMSF&quot; to the more broad &quot;spotted fever rickettsiosis&quot; (which includes RMSF). Using this new definition, there were 4470 cases of spotted fever rickettsiosis reported in 2012, the majority of which were presumed to be RMSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>In 2010, the incidence rate of RMSF by state ranged from 0 to 63 cases per million persons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68225\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68225 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The infection was most prevalent in the southeastern and south central states. The geographic distribution of RMSF reflects the different populations of transmitting ticks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. This was illustrated in Arizona, where RMSF has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on Indian reservations, and has been associated with infestations of the tick vector, <em>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In addition, family clusters of infection are a well-recognized feature of RMSF because of shared residence and risk for vector exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> below.)</p><p>Although RMSF is more common in rural and suburban locations, it may occasionally occur in residents of urban areas. For example, cases of RMSF have been described in New York City in patients who presumably acquired the infection from tick bites in urban parks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Disease severity can vary significantly from mild to fulminant disease. In an effort to identify any variations in disease severity by geographic location, 4533 cases of RMSF were coded by county and classified according to disease severity. Of these reported cases, there were 1089 hospitalizations and 23 deaths. Significant clusters of hospitalizations and deaths were detected in southwestern Tennessee while low rates of severity were found in some areas of North Carolina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Similar clusters of severe disease have been reported in several locations in South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the causes of these differences in severity are unknown, nor is it known whether treatment delays may have contributed to these results. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonal variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The seasonal distribution of RMSF parallels the activity of the transmitting ticks (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Vectors'</a> below). Most cases of RMSF occur in the spring and early summer, when outdoor activity is most frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in Arizona, cases transmitted by the vector <em>R. sanguineus</em> peaked in July and September [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Rare cases have also been reported in the cold weather months among residents living in the southern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Whether these unseasonal cases are due to infection with <em>R. rickettsii </em>or other more benign spotted fever group rickettsiae has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although previous studies found that the highest incidence of RMSF occurred in children &lt;10 years, surveillance during 2003 demonstrated the highest age-specific incidence was among persons aged 40 to 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Individuals with frequent exposure to dogs and who reside near wooded areas or areas with high grass may also be at increased risk for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>American Indians appear to be at greater risk for RMSF than the general U.S. population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A retrospective study utilizing a national surveillance database found that the incidence of RMSF among American Indians was 16.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/100,000</span> during the period from 2000 to 2005. In contrast, the incidence among whites and blacks was 4.2 and 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/100,000,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However epidemiologic studies that attempt to assess the frequency of RMSF have been hampered by imprecise case definitions, inherent limitations in diagnostic assays, and lack of pathologic confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22</a>]. For example, only 5.8 percent of 7796 case report forms received by the CDC from 2000 to 2007 were classified as &quot;confirmed&quot; infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13428921\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial therapy has resulted in a marked reduction in the case fatality (CF) rate of patients with RMSF. In the preantibiotic era, the CF rate ranged from 20 to 30 percent in the eastern United States to as high as 80 percent in the Bitterroot Valley in Montana. However, during the period from 1981 to 1998, the average annual CF rate was 3.3 percent (range 1.1 to 4.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The mortality from RMSF has continued to decrease. As an example, in a series of 7796 cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the overall CF rate declined from 2.2 percent in the year 2000 to 0.3 percent in 2007; this rate remained essentially unchanged from 2007 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/6,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24</a>]. Despite this overall decrease, mortality associated with RMSF has remained high in certain areas. The CF rate has been reported to be 7 percent on several American Indian reservations in Arizona, due in part to delays in initiating antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The accuracy of published data on CF rates for RMSF remains controversial. Some experts believe that the remarkably low CF rates reported for RMSF in the United States since 2000 represent either misdiagnosis of other less virulent rickettsioses (eg, <em>Rickettsia parkeri</em>) or poorly understood regional geographic variations in strains of <em>R. rickettsii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, cases of fatal RMSF may escape diagnosis, as death can occur before serologic evidence of infection is obtained, and autopsy will not identify the organism unless special histochemical staining of tissue is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The CF rate is highest in the very young (&le;4 years, 3 to 4 percent) and the elderly (&ge;60 years, 4 to 9 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63215\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63215 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other host factors associated with severe or fatal RMSF include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/6,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27-29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black race</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic alcohol abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</p><p/><p>In addition, early therapy for RMSF (ie, within five days of symptom onset) is important since a delay in treatment has been associated with an increased risk of mortality.

However, up to one-third of patients do not report a history of a tick bite, since the inoculation site is generally painless and often obscured by hair or a skin fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The tick transmits infection to humans during feeding. After the tick has been attached to the host for 6 to 10 hours, rickettsiae are released from the salivary glands of the ticks. In addition, humans may become infected by contact with tick tissues or fluids during the process of tick removal. Laboratory workers may acquire rickettsial infection through inhalation of contaminated aerosols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vectors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The various ticks, which serve as the vector and reservoir of <em>R. rickettsii</em>, vary by location. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630609\"><span class=\"h3\">Within the United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal vector of RMSF in the eastern and south central United States is Dermacentor variabilis (the American dog tick) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71719\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71719 \">picture 1</a>). In contrast, Dermacentor andersoni (the Rocky Mountain wood tick) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68829\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68829 \">picture 2</a>) is the primary vector in the mountain states west of the Mississippi River.</p><p>Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the common brown dog tick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72221\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72221 \">picture 3</a>), is also a vector for RMSF in the southwestern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630616\"><span class=\"h3\">Outside the United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Cayenne tick (<em>Amblyomma cajennense</em>) is a vector for <em>R. rickettsii </em>transmission in Central and South America.

However, all of these diagnostic clues are rarely identified on the initial patient encounter, leading to delays in appropriate therapy. In fulminant cases of RMSF, death may occur as early as within five days. Poor outcomes have been associated with delay of appropriate antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Early nonspecific symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the early phase of illness, most patients have nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as fever (which is typically present in a high percentage of patients), headache, malaise, myalgias, and arthralgias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The onset of symptoms may be gradual or abrupt and the headache is often severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Nausea, with or without vomiting, is a common complaint. Some patients, especially children, may also have prominent abdominal pain that may be severe; the onset of abdominal pain before the onset of rash may lead to erroneous diagnoses such as acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, and even bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rash occurs in approximately 88 to 90 percent of patients, but is uncommonly seen at initial clinical presentation. Most patients with RMSF develop a rash between the third and fifth days of illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58061\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58061 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/12,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,37</a>]. Only 14 percent of patients have rash on the first day, and less than one-half develop a rash in the first 72 hours of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As a result, rash is often absent when patients first contact a clinician for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40</a>]. </p><p>The hallmark of RMSF is a blanching erythematous rash with macules (1 to 4 mm in size) that become petechial over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the evolution of skin rash may vary; some patients may suddenly develop a petechial rash without a prior maculopapular eruption. The appearance of the rash usually begins on the ankles and wrists and spreads to the trunk; rash that appears on the palms and soles is highly characteristic of RMSF, but usually occurs in later-stage disease.</p><p>In a small percentage of patients, the rash is atypical, remaining confined to one body region. In severe cases, the rash may become confluent, with some areas of skin undergoing necrosis due to pathogen-induced damage to the microcirculation, especially in regions supplied by terminal arteries, such as the fingers, toes, nose, ears, and genitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Eschars at the site of the tick bite are rarely seen and would be suggestive of other diagnoses, such as boutonneuse fever or African tick bite fever, which would have other epidemiologic clues, such as travel history to Europe or Africa, respectively. Urticaria and pruritus are not characteristic of RMSF and their presence makes the diagnosis unlikely. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A potential diagnostic problem is that rash never occurs in up to 10 percent of patients. These cases of &quot;spotless&quot; RMSF may be severe with a fatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition, the rash can be easily overlooked in dark-skinned individuals. These observations are important clinically because a delay in the institution of antimicrobial therapy beyond five days is associated with an increased mortality rate (22.9 versus 6.5 percent in those treated earlier in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Conjunctivitis, retinal abnormalities, and electrocardiographic abnormalities may also rarely occur and lead to diagnostic confusion. </p><p>Major complications include: encephalitis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and skin necrosis. The onset of neurologic involvement is associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity; in one retrospective study of 92 children with RMSF, 13 had neurologic sequelae at discharge including encephalopathy, ataxia and blindness, which were attributed to delays in diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25541938\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination may be notable for rash, pedal edema (especially in children), confusion, conjunctival erythema, and retinal abnormalities.

As the illness progresses, thrombocytopenia becomes more prevalent and may be severe; this is a helpful diagnostic clue to the possibility of rickettsial disease, but a normal platelet count does not exclude the diagnosis. Thrombocytopenia is thought to result from increased destruction at sites of rickettsia-mediated vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The low platelet count may be accompanied by a reduced fibrinogen concentration and elevated fibrin split products; however, disseminated intravascular coagulation is rare.</p><p>Other findings that are common in advanced cases include hyponatremia, elevations in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin, azotemia, and prolongation of the partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Hyponatremia is a particularly common finding in patients with central nervous system involvement. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis may demonstrate pleocytosis; both monocytic and polymorphonuclear predominance have been described; elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein is seen in approximately one-third of patients. </p><p>Azotemia is common and usually due to hypovolemia; acute tubular necrosis may result from systemic hypotension with multi-organ involvement. In the latter group of patients, urinalysis may reveal coarse granular casts. In a small number of cases, jaundice and renal failure dominate and confuse the clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In a review of 114 patients from our hospital, 19 percent developed acute renal failure (defined as an elevation in the serum creatinine concentration above 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A variety of mechanisms may contribute to this complication, including hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis, intravascular thrombosis, and interstitial vascular inflammation due to direct infection of the endothelial cells by <em>R. rickettsii</em>.

Moderately elevated protein (100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and a normal glucose level are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

The appearance of rash and the increasing severity of the illness may prompt consideration of rickettsial infection. </p><p>In view of the protean clinical features of RMSF, it is not surprising that this disorder is often confused with a wide array of other conditions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the patient with fever and headache, the key other diagnostic consideration is meningococcal meningitis, which has a high mortality rate if prompt therapeutic interventions are not offered. The other diagnostic considerations include West Nile virus meningitis or encephalitis. Patients who are nontoxic in appearance may have enteroviral meningitis or syphilitic meningitis, or Lyme disease, which is characterized by an erythematous rash with central clearing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the patient with fever and petechial rash, the main considerations include meningococcemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune complex vasculitis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, leptospirosis, and bacterial sepsis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms may be misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis or an acute abdomen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the onset of maculopapular rash, RMSF has also been confused with measles, infectious mononucleosis, viral hepatitis, ehrlichiosis, streptococcal infection, primary HIV, secondary syphilis, parvovirus infection (Fifth disease), Kawasaki disease, and roseola. If penicillin or a cephalosporin is administered empirically during the early phase of illness, the subsequent rash may then be incorrectly diagnosed as a drug eruption, rather than the rash of RMSF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In tropical areas, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, and dengue may be confused with RMSF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of RMSF overlap with those of both monocytic ehrlichiosis and granulocytic anaplasmosis. Distinguishing between RMSF and ehrlichiosis on the basis of clinical features may be impossible, although the presence of leukopenia and the absence of rash are more typical of ehrlichiosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50677 \">table 1</a>). However, the preferred treatment of ehrlichiosis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, is the same as that of RMSF.

Thus, most patients will require empiric therapy since RMSF can rarely be confirmed or disproved in its early phase. Clinicians should <strong>not </strong>wait for the skin rash to develop before initiating treatment. A discussion on the approach to treatment in patients with probable or confirmed RMSF is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever#H4101120159\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197411453\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. rickettsii </em>cannot be cultured in most clinical laboratories. Thus, the clinical diagnosis must be confirmed through serologic testing or through the use of special stains on a skin biopsy. Optimally, the skin biopsy should be performed either before or within 12 hours of administering antibiotics; however, treatment should not be delayed to obtain this procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630755\"><span class=\"h3\">Serologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical diagnosis of RMSF is usually confirmed retrospectively through serologic testing since the test results are usually not available at the time of clinical decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Although serologic testing using the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test remains the standard method of diagnosis of RMSF, there are some important limitations to this approach. </p><p>IFA testing is available through state health departments and through several large reference laboratories. </p><p>Serologic testing is helpful for a retrospective diagnosis of RMSF but will not assist in clinical decision making. IgM and IgG antibodies typically appear 7 to 10 days after the onset of the illness, and the optimal time to obtain a convalescent antibody titer is at 14 to 21 days after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. A fourfold rise in IgG titers between acute and convalescent sera is diagnostic of seroconversion and recent illness. The minimum diagnostic titer in most laboratories is 1:64. </p><p>Indirect immunofluorescence testing is available commercially. The overall sensitivity of the IFA test is approximately 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, there are two settings in which false negative results are more likely:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing is usually not helpful during the first five days of symptoms, when therapy should be initiated, because the antibody response is not yet detectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, a negative serology should not dissuade a clinician from initiating appropriate therapy in a patient with compatible illness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early treatment for RMSF may blunt antibody responses. A few patients who were treated within the first 48 hours after onset of symptoms did not develop convalescent antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The frequency at which this phenomenon occurs is unknown.</p><p/><p>In contrast, a false positive IgM titer may occur if there is cross-reactivity to lipopolysaccharide from a bacterial pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]; thus, the utility of this test has been called into question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Although the IFA is sensitive, serologic assays are insufficient to identify conclusively the specific rickettsial agent responsible for the infection. A study of 15 serum specimens with antibodies reactive with <em>R. rickettsii </em>from the CDC examined the specimens by microimmunofluorescence and Western blot assays against antigens of <em>R. rickettsii </em>and <em>R. parkeri</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Four patients had higher titers of antibody to <em>R. rickettsii</em>, five had higher titers to <em>R. parkeri</em>, and in six patients, titers were equivalent to both rickettsial pathogens. Thus, spotted fever group rickettsiae, other than <em>R. rickettsii</em>, may be responsible for cases of tick-borne rickettsiosis in the United States.</p><p>Other serologic tests that may be employed include enzyme immunoassay (EIA), complement fixation (CF) and latex agglutination (LA), indirect hemagglutination (IHA), or microagglutination (MA) assays. A probable diagnosis of RMSF may be established with a titer of 1:128 or greater by LA, IHA, or MA.</p><p>The Weil-Felix test, which detects cross-reacting antibodies against Proteus vulgaris antigens (OX2 and OX19), lacks sensitivity and specificity and its use is no longer recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/37,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct immunofluorescence testing or immunoperoxidase staining can be performed for <em>R. rickettsii</em> on a skin biopsy specimen and may offer a more timely diagnosis if the laboratory is equipped with the appropriate methodology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Molecular assays for detection of R. rickettsial DNA are restricted to research laboratories. </p><p>Biopsy of a skin lesion obtained with a 3 mm punch biopsy can establish the diagnosis of RMSF.

Direct immunofluorescence staining can provide an answer in a few hours if the necessary conjugates are available locally. If local facilities are not able to do direct immunofluorescence, reference laboratories can perform immunoperoxidase stains on fixed tissue specimens. However, the delay in obtaining results makes this technique of little or no use for initial patient management.</p><p>The sensitivity of detecting <em>R. rickettsii </em>in skin biopsies by direct immunofluorescence staining is approximately 70 percent with a specificity of 100 percent; however, the sensitivity rapidly declines after antirickettsial therapy is begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
