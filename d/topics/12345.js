However, the role of CT colonography in screening for CRC is controversial. While there is consensus that CT colonography should not be used for screening in patients at increased risk for CRC (eg, history of adenomas, inflammatory bowel disease, familial CRC syndrome), guidelines differ in their recommendations for CT colonography in average-risk individuals.

The length of the interval between colorectal surgery and CT colonography should be based on the underlying disease and the location of the colonic anastomosis, but should be at least six weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-diverticulitis-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute diverticulitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Exclusion of an underlying malignancy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery#H800377\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anastomotic complications of colorectal surgery&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient preparation consists of dietary restriction with a low-residue diet and clear liquids for 24 hours or more and bowel preparation with a laxative. Patient preparation is critical for computed tomographic (CT) colonography as stool can obscure underlying polyps or mass lesions, and in some cases, can simulate polyps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75282\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75282 \">picture 1</a>). Several regimens (eg, polyethylene glycol, phosphosoda, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a>) have been used. It is important to consider the patient's comorbid illnesses when choosing an appropriate preparation or combination of preparations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even with the use of cathartic colon preparations, retained fluid in the lumen may obscure or mimic small polyps. Residual material is therefore tagged with oral administration of water-soluble contrast alone (typically with several meals prior to the examination) or in combination with a low-volume <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The contrast-enhanced residual material can then be differentiated from the surrounding colonic mucosa. While bowel preparation is required at the present time, CT colonography without a cathartic bowel preparation is also being evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1579995643\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique and data acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following placement of a thin and flexible rectal catheter, the colon is distended with air or carbon dioxide throughout its length. Carbon dioxide has an improved patient tolerance as compared with air due to more rapid post-procedure absorption. Distension is also facilitated by use of smooth muscle relaxants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> or hyoscine, which reduce peristalsis. However, these agents also enhance reflux of gas into the small bowel, which complicates interpretation of the study and automated computerized tracking along the gas-filled lumen. Colonic distension is evaluated on the computed tomographic (CT) table immediately prior to image acquisition by reviewing the planar CT scout image in order to ensure technical adequacy of the resultant acquisition. </p><p>Following this, an uninterrupted volume of data is then acquired through the abdomen in several seconds during a single breath-hold. Because of the presence of stool, fluid, or bowel spasm, data are often acquired in both the supine and prone positions in order to redistribute fluid and colonic gas, thereby facilitating polyp detection. Scanning parameters are designed to cover a large volume of data with thin slices (in many cases, submillimeter) in order to optimize subsequent image reformation. </p><p>Intravenous injection of iodinated contrast medium is reserved for patients with known colorectal cancer in order to improve staging, in patients with symptoms of colorectal cancer, or in whom the extracolonic organs need to be further evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Image processing and reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once image data are acquired, post-processing is performed on a computer using a variety of commercially available software packages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The data are then used to render multiplanar reformatted images (in coronal, sagittal, and axial planes), mucosal relief profiles, or hybrid surface-shaded or volume-rendered endoluminal perspectives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71187 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>Each technique provides different information, and studies should be tailored to answer the specific clinical question. For the virtual endoluminal study, interactive viewing of the study is performed at near real-time speeds, with the operator capable of simultaneously viewing other anatomic projections at the same site while being able to control the speed and direction of flight. Shutter widths, bowel wall transparency, lesion and bowel wall measurements, and image recording can all be performed.</p><p>Three rendering techniques are in clinical use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surface rendering relies on selection of a specific range of CT attenuation values, whereby only pixels within a preselected range are included in the three-dimensional reconstruction. A simulated light source provides a sense of depth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With volume rendering, voxels are assigned different degrees of opacity and the entire CT data set is used, producing a final image that more faithfully represents the true anatomic structures being imaged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perspective rendering, an adjunct to volume rendering, provides a sense of motion, depth, and the ability to navigate or fly-through the bowel lumen.</p><p/><p>The development of software designed to enhance polyp detection automatically (computer-aided detection) is ongoing, with several US Food and Drug Administration-approved products available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TEST PERFORMANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acceptability and effectiveness of CT colonography in the detection of colorectal neoplasia in asymptomatic patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening and those with symptoms of colorectal cancer are discussed in detail, separately.

Complications related to the various colonoscopy preparations are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1153081645\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonic perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomographic (CT) colonography has a low risk of colonic perforation as compared with colonoscopy. In one review of three studies that included 50,860 subjects who underwent a CT colonography for evaluation of symptoms or for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, there were a total of 18 perforations (0.035 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Potential factors associated with colonic perforation include the use of a rectal balloon for inflation, rigid rectal catheters, manual air insufflation, and patient factors including active inflammatory bowel disease, prior colon surgery, recent deep colonic biopsies, inguinal hernia, and obstructing CRC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults#H133249479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colonoscopy in adults&quot;, section on 'Perforation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT colonography exposes patients to ionizing radiation, and repeated examination leads to a small but significant cumulative radiation exposure with associated risk of cancer. In one study, CT colonography performed every five years for patients between the ages of 50 and 80 years would result in 150 radiation-related <span class=\"nowrap\">cancers/100,000</span> individuals screened, but would prevent 3580 to 5190 <span class=\"nowrap\">CRCs/100,000</span> individuals screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The benefit-risk ratio for cancers prevented to the number of cancers induced varied from 24:1 to 35:1. This study assumed a radiation dose of 8&#8197;mSv for women and 7&#8197;mSv for men, which is higher than the present average dose of 4.4&#8197;mSv [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Further dose reduction to 1 mSv with iterative reconstruction algorithms and lower tube voltage may further decrease the risk of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidental extracolonic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although CT colonography can identify important extracolonic diseases, in a large number of cases it leads to unnecessary evaluation of incidental findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The incidence of extracolonic findings increases significantly with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Additional evaluation for potentially important extracolonic findings occurs in approximately 10 percent of cases. Approximately 2 to 5 percent of findings on CT colonography are ultimately of importance. These include abdominal aortic aneurysms, adrenal masses, nonmalignant renal masses, and in 0.5 percent of cases, extracolonic cancers. Of the extracolonic cancers detected on CT colonography, renal cell cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma are most prevalent and are usually localized at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. However, it is unknown if detection of these malignancies improves outcomes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1662726037\"><span class=\"h2\">Other complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the absence of sedation, cardiovascular complications are rare in patients undergoing CT colonography. However, vasovagal reactions may occur due to the pain induced by colonic distension. In one retrospective review of 17,067 CT colonography examinations, there were three vasovagal episodes and one episode of angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-computed-tomographic-colonography/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].
