Goiters can be diffuse or nodular, depending on the cause, and may be associated with normal, decreased, or increased thyroid hormone production. The clinical manifestations vary with thyroid function and with the size and location of the goiter. The evaluation of the adult with goiter will be reviewed here. The treatment of goiter in adults and the evaluation and treatment of goiter in children are reviewed separately.

Thyroid volume measured by ultrasonography is slightly greater in men than women, increases with age and body weight, and decreases with increasing iodine intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-thyroid-ultrasound#H26548600\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of thyroid ultrasound&quot;, section on 'Estimation of thyroid gland volume'</a>.)</p><p>The normal thyroid gland is immediately caudal to the larynx and encircles the anterolateral portion of the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>). The thyroid is bordered by the trachea and esophagus posteriorly and the carotid sheath laterally. Enlarging thyroid lobes usually grow outward because of their location in the anterior neck in front of the trachea, covered only by thin strap muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. As a result of this outward growth, even very large goiters may not compress the trachea or impinge on the great vessels lateral to the lobes. However, in patients with substantial enlargement of one lobe or asymmetric enlargement of both lobes, the trachea, esophagus, or blood vessels may be displaced or, less often, compressed. Bilateral lobar enlargement, especially if the goiter extends posterior to the trachea, may cause either compression or concentric narrowing of the trachea or compression of the esophagus or jugular veins.</p><p>The thoracic inlet is an ovoid area that measures approximately 5 x 10 cm bounded by the sternum anteriorly, the first thoracic vertebral body posteriorly, and the first ribs laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79394 \">figure 2</a>). The inlet is traversed by the trachea, esophagus, blood vessels, and nerves. The inferior pole of each thyroid lobe normally lies above the thoracic inlet. However, with some goiters, there is growth of one or both lobes through the inlet into the thoracic cavity, which can result in obstruction of any of the structures in the inlet. Such goiters are called substernal, although retrosternal is probably a more precise term. Most substernal goiters are in the anterolateral mediastinum, but approximately 10 percent are located primarily in the posterior mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The prevalence of substernal goiter as a percentage of thyroidectomies ranges from 2 to 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62289320\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter worldwide. In mildly and moderately iodine-deficient regions in Denmark, goiter (as determined by ultrasonography) is present in 15 and 22.6 percent of the population, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'Diffuse and nodular goiter'</a>). In the United States, where significant iodine deficiency does not exist, multinodular goiter, chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, and Graves' disease are more common causes of goiter. In older adults, multinodular goiter is most common.</p><p>Other less common causes of goiter include tumors, thyroiditis, and infiltrative diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67399 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroiditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infiltrative-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infiltrative thyroid disease&quot;</a>). The risk of thyroid cancer within a multinodular goiter is approximately 3 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], similar to the risk in a solitary thyroid nodule. In a series of 718 patients operated on for goiter in Pakistan, 3 percent of patients were found to have a malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10798374\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with iodine deficiency or chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, an increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion is the predominant cause of goiter. In contrast, most patients with sporadic nontoxic multinodular goiters have normal serum TSH concentrations. In these individuals, the thyroid enlargement is probably caused by several growth factors (including TSH) that act over time on thyroid follicular cells that have different synthetic and growth potentials. There is often a family history of goiter, suggesting that genetic factors may also play a role. The result is diffuse and later multinodular thyroid enlargement. Some nodules eventually become autonomous due to activating mutations in the TSH receptor or G proteins within the thyroid follicular cells. The following observations support this sequence of events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid volume is larger in older patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The longer the patient has a goiter, the larger the size of the goiter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The larger the size of the goiter, the lower the serum TSH concentration</p><p/><p>In patients with Graves' disease, TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) stimulate the TSH receptor to cause thyroid growth and excessive hormonal secretion.

Some patients may have symptoms and biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. However, the majority of patients with goiter are asymptomatic and biochemically euthyroid. Patients with longstanding, large goiters may develop symptoms of obstruction due to progressive compression of the trachea or sudden enlargement (usually accompanied by pain) secondary to hemorrhage into a nodule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6514313\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most goiters grow very slowly over many decades. Therefore, the majority of patients with goiter are asymptomatic. The goiter may first be noted on physical examination or found incidentally on cross-sectional imaging studies performed for unrelated reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6514256\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the goiter is due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis or severe iodine deficiency, patients may have symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance). If due to multinodular goiter (with autonomy) or Graves' disease, patients may have symptoms of hyperthyroidism (eg, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, unexplained weight loss). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6514262\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with longstanding goiters (cervical or substernal) may develop symptoms of obstruction due to progressive compression of the trachea or sudden enlargement (usually accompanied by pain) secondary to hemorrhage into a nodule. The majority of patients with obstructive cervical goiters have had a visible goiter for many years. Most patients with substernal goiter (77 to 90 percent in two series) also have visible goiters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>], although some are found incidentally on imaging studies performed for unrelated reasons. In those without visible goiter, substernal goiters may also be found because of obstructive symptoms. Since goiters tend to grow slowly, substernal goiters are most commonly discovered during the fifth and sixth decades of life and are found more often in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The most common symptom in patients with obstructive cervical or substernal goiter is exertional dyspnea, which is present in 30 to 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/3,12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-17</a>]. This symptom usually occurs when the tracheal diameter is less than 8 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In some patients with substernal goiter, dyspnea is primarily positional or nocturnal and it occurs primarily during maneuvers that force the thyroid into the thoracic inlet, such as reaching and bending. When tracheal compression becomes severe (luminal diameter less than 5 mm), stridor or wheezing occurs at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This upper airway wheezing must be distinguished from asthma. An upper respiratory illness may exacerbate upper airway obstruction.</p><p>Cough is present in 10 to 30 percent of patients, and it may be positional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Pain is unusual, but a choking sensation is common.</p><p>Goiter may contribute to obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroidectomy may improve symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In a study of 45 patients with snoring symptoms who were undergoing thyroidectomy for any reason (42 percent for goiter or compressive symptoms), 29 percent had improved snoring frequency, apnea, and frequency of daytime somnolence after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A variety of other symptoms can be induced by obstructive goiter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia is a less common complaint because of the posterior position of the esophagus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression of a recurrent laryngeal nerve may cause transient or permanent vocal cord palsy, resulting in hoarseness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phrenic nerve paralysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Horner's syndrome due to compression of the cervical sympathetic chain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, jugular vein compression or thrombosis, cerebrovascular steal syndromes, or even the superior vena cava syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6509061\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a goiter is usually made at the time of a physical examination. One or more discrete nodules may be palpable. Goiter may also be an incidental finding during a radiologic procedure performed for other purposes (eg, carotid ultrasound, chest computed tomography [CT] scan, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] cervical spine).

It is important to rule out malignancy through history, clinical examination, ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of large or suspicious nodules. In the United States, in the absence of autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease) and thyroid malignancy, benign multinodular goiter is the most likely diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6514249\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with goiter, a history of iodine intake (including country of origin), medication history, family history of benign or malignant thyroid disease, and history of head and neck irradiation or radioiodine exposure from nuclear power plant accidents (Chernobyl, Fukushima) should be obtained. In addition, patients should be questioned about the presence of obstructive symptoms (dyspnea, cough, wheezing) or symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism.</p><p>The thyroid and surrounding neck structures should be carefully examined. We prefer to palpate the thyroid from the front of the patient so that landmarks such as the cricoid cartilage and sternocleidomastoid muscles are visible. The isthmus is located just below the cricoid. Thumbs or fingers are placed obliquely between the sternocleidomastoid and the trachea, compressing thyroid tissue on the tracheal surface. It is helpful to watch the patient swallow a sip of water before palpation, assessing for enlargement and asymmetry. Then, having the patient swallow water during palpation allows the examiner to feel the upward movement of the thyroid gland. The neck should be palpated to assess the size of the thyroid gland, for the presence of firm or dominant nodules, and for cervical adenopathy. The presence of a thyroid bruit (a sign of increased blood flow) may indicate hyperthyroidism, typically due to Graves' disease. One or more discrete nodules may be palpable. However, the physical examination of goiter is highly inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/6,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,23</a>]. Glands that are diffuse on physical exam are often nodular by sonography, and most individuals with thyroid enlargement and a solitary palpable nodule on physical examination actually have multiple nodules when investigated by sonography.</p><p>Tracheal deviation may be visible or palpable if the goiter is asymmetric. Rarely, dilated neck veins are present. All patients with obstructive symptoms caused by a cervical goiter alone have obvious thyroid enlargement, as do many patients with substernal goiter. The possibility of substantial substernal extension is suggested by the inability to identify the lower end of the thyroid gland. When the lower end cannot be identified with the patient sitting, it may be possible to do so if the patient lies down with a pillow under the shoulders to hyperextend the neck.</p><p>Pemberton's maneuver can be used to exacerbate obstructive symptoms by forcing the thyroid into the thoracic inlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79394 \">figure 2</a>). In this maneuver, the examiner holds the patient's arms vertically above the head for approximately 60 seconds. The test is considered positive if the patient's neck veins become more distended or if the patient develops facial plethora, cyanosis, or inability to swallow, or if dyspnea or stridor appear or worsen. Rarely, a cervical goiter becomes impacted in the thoracic inlet by this maneuver or by acute neck flexion or reaching; this is called the &quot;thyroid cork&quot; phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Apparent bronchospasm may represent upper airway obstruction or bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Careful auscultation of the chest and airway in positions that minimize and maximize potential upper airway obstruction (described above) may suggest the need for further evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62289336\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation in all patients with goiter (discovered either by palpation or incidentally noted on a radiologic procedure) is measurement of serum TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101377\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101377 \">algorithm 1</a>). Thyroid ultrasound is also usually obtained. Many thyroid experts also measure thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies.</p><p>Patients with abnormal TSH, worrisome features on physical examination (asymmetry, focal firm consistency, tenderness) or thyroid ultrasound, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstructive symptoms require additional testing.

We typically measure TPO antibodies in patients with goiter and normal TSH to assess for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</p><p>For patients with elevated TSH (hypothyroidism) and goiter living in the United States, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is most likely, and TPO antibodies are almost always elevated. Therefore, we do not routinely measure TPO antibodies in hypothyroid patients with goiter, although some thyroid experts check serum TPO antibodies in such patients to confirm the diagnosis of Hashimoto's.</p><p>Rare causes of hypothyroidism and goiter without TPO antibodies include &quot;seronegative&quot; Hashimoto's thyroiditis, partial biosynthetic defects in thyroid hormone synthesis or iodine utilization, or infiltrative disorders of the thyroid.

Focal areas of increased uptake should be correlated with possible nodules on ultrasound. Determining the etiology of hyperthyroidism is reviewed in detail separately.

The incidence of thyroid cancer was no higher than the incidence in patients with cervical goiters. Risk factors for malignancy may include family history of thyroid disease, history of head and neck radiation, recurrent goiter, and the presence of cervical adenopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6515354\"><span class=\"h4\">Radiologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substernal goiters are often seen on chest radiograph as a mass that causes tracheal narrowing or deviation or as superior mediastinal widening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71486\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71486 \">image 1</a>). Past radiographs, if available, permit an estimate of the rate of growth of the goiter, and neck radiographs may show narrowing of the airway. However, the extent of the goiter and its effect upon surrounding structures should be assessed by CT or MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101836%7EENDO%2F101835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101836 graphicRef101835 \">image 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>CT is very useful for evaluating the extent of both large cervical goiters and substernal goiters. There are, however, three important caveats regarding CT scans:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The entire vertical length of the goiter should be imaged. Although it may be necessary to order both neck and chest CT, it should be possible to specify that images be obtained to the lowest extent of the goiter. It is unusual for a substernal goiter to extend more than 1 to 2 cm below the level of the aortic arch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scanning is often performed with the patient's neck in the neutral position or slightly flexed, which may exaggerate the extent of substernal extension of the goiter. A small goiter that extends 1 to 1.5 cm below the sternal notch on CT may be entirely cervical when the neck is extended and, therefore, is less likely to be the cause of any obstructive symptoms the patient may have.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iodinated radiocontrast agents should not be given routinely, because the iodine may induce overt hyperthyroidism in those patients who have subclinical hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and exacerbate hyperthyroidism in those who have overt hyperthyroidism. In fact, because of the iodine content within the gland, contrast is never needed to image the thyroid. If imaging after administration of a radiocontrast agent is required to identify vascular structures, a patient with subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism should be pretreated with an antithyroid drug to prevent thyroidal organification of iodine. One such regimen is to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a> 10 mg twice daily for two weeks beginning at least two hours before the contrast agent is given. Alternatively, MRI can be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction#H26089418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Thyroid ultrasonography, although more accurate than CT for defining thyroid anatomy in the anterior neck, is not satisfactory for imaging of posterior neck structures or the substernal region. Ultrasound is useful to assess the features of the goiter and characteristics of any nodules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Goiter'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease#H26549334\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Thyroid nodules'</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid radionuclide imaging with radioiodine will define areas of autonomous function in patients with large cervical goiters and may be useful but is occasionally misleading in patients with substernal goiter.

However, some substernal goiters are not identified, because they take up radioiodine poorly and the radioactivity is attenuated by the sternum and clavicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>].</p><p>While radionuclide imaging is unnecessary if thyroidectomy is planned, it should be obtained to identify areas of function if either limited surgery in a hyperthyroid patient or treatment with radioiodine is being considered. When radionuclide imaging is performed, anatomic markers should be placed on palpable cervical thyroid tissue and the suprasternal notch so that substernal tissue can be identified; a size marker should also be added.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6515563\"><span class=\"h4\">Flow-volume loop</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A flow-volume loop study to assess for airway obstruction should be performed in patients with obstructive symptoms and in those with substernal goiter with tracheal narrowing to less than 10 mm, even in the absence of obstructive symptoms, particularly if the patient or physician is reluctant to proceed with surgery and the results of the study would influence the decision to proceed with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>].

Some patients may have symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. However, the majority of patients with goiter are asymptomatic. Patients with longstanding goiters may develop symptoms of obstruction, due to progressive compression of the trachea or sudden enlargement (usually accompanied by pain) secondary to hemorrhage into a nodule.

One or more discrete nodules may be palpable. Goiter may also be an incidental finding during a radiologic procedure performed for other purposes (eg, carotid ultrasound or chest computed tomography [CT] or cervical magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Once goiter is detected, the diagnostic evaluation is aimed at assessment of its size and the presence of nodules, identifying whether there are compressive or obstructive symptoms, assessing thyroid function, and identifying the underlying cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67399 \">table 1</a>).
