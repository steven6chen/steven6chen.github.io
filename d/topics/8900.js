Many of the agents that are used for cancer therapy share a risk for infusion reactions, most of which occur with the first dose. Although the majority of reactions are mild and not life threatening, serious reactions can occur and may be fatal if not managed appropriately.</p><p>After an introductory section summarizing the characteristics of infusion reactions and the general principles underlying prevention and treatment of these reactions, this review will discuss the reactions that occur with individual MoAbs used for cancer treatment and the prevention and management of these reactions. A discussion of infusion reactions to conventional cytotoxic agents is presented separately, as is a more in depth discussion of cutaneous adverse effects associated with both cytotoxic agents and the therapeutic MoAbs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infusion reactions to systemic chemotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-side-effects-of-conventional-chemotherapy-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous side effects of conventional chemotherapy agents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-side-effects-of-molecularly-targeted-therapy-and-other-biologic-agents-used-for-cancer-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous side effects of molecularly targeted therapy and other biologic agents used for cancer therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF REACTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infusion reactions to MoAbs typically develop within 30 minutes to two hours after the initiation of drug infusion, although symptoms may be delayed for up to 24 hours. The majority of reactions occur after the first or second exposure to the agent, but between 10 and 30 percent occur during subsequent treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In general, the likelihood of an infusion reaction declines with each subsequent course of therapy.</p><p>The incidence of an infusion reaction during the first drug administration varies among individual agents and is highest for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (both intravenous and subcutaneous) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> (&ge;50 percent each), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> (up to 40 percent), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> (up to 20 percent, depending on the geographic area of residence).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms of infusion reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous infusion reactions may affect any organ system in the body. Most are mild in severity, although severe and even fatal reactions occur. The most common signs and symptoms of infusion reactions are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shaking chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> itching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in heart rate and blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea or chest discomfort</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various types of skin rashes</p><p/><p>In this review, infusion reactions involving these symptoms will be referred to as &quot;standard infusion reactions&quot; (SIRs). These represent the majority of reactions to MoAbs that are administered intravenously.</p><p>Administration-related reactions have also occurred in a substantial number of individuals receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> subcutaneously; in this situation, the most common reaction has been injection site erythema, pruritus, rash, and pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of SIRs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact mechanism responsible for SIRs caused by any of the MoAbs is unclear. Most reactions appear to be the result of antibody-antigen interactions resulting in cytokine release. The most predictable reaction occurs with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and is thought to be caused by the interaction of the drug with the target antigen (CD20) on circulating cells, followed by cytokine release from lymphocytes. Evidence for this mechanism includes the observation that severe and fatal reactions have typically occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating lymphocytes bearing the target antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The mechanism underlying infusion reactions with therapeutic MoAbs might also be related to their ability to elicit human antichimeric antibodies (HACAs), human antihuman (HAHAs), or human antimouse (HAMAs) antibodies. However, a correlation between infusion reactions and HACAs or HAHAs has not been convincingly demonstrated for any drug. Furthermore, the development of antibodies to most of these drugs is far less common (one percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) than the incidence of infusion reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis is a reaction that is rare with most MoAbs and best described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>. Anaphylaxis caused by intravenously administered medications most often presents with the following signs and symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous symptoms: flushing, itching, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema (usually of face, eyelids, or lips)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory symptoms: repetitive cough, sudden nasal congestion, shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheeze, sensation of throat closure or choking, and or change in voice quality (due to laryngeal edema)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular symptoms: faintness, tachycardia (or less often bradycardia), tunnel vision, chest pain, hypotension, sense of impending doom, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of consciousness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms: such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea</p><p/><p>Anaphylaxis from all causes is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis overlap with those of SIRs, and the two can be indistinguishable. However, there are certain signs and symptoms that are highly suggestive of anaphylaxis, and their presence should be specifically sought when evaluating a patient with an infusion reaction: urticaria, repetitive cough, wheeze, and throat <span class=\"nowrap\">tightness/change</span> in voice. These stereotypical signs and symptoms result from the release of mediators from mast cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils. In contrast, fever and muscular pain are not features of anaphylaxis, and the presence of these suggests the reaction is a SIR. </p><p>It is critical to undress the patient and examine the skin carefully during infusion reactions in order to detect urticaria. The neck, trunk, abdomen, and axillae are the sites at which urticaria often appear first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Definition and mechanism of anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis was traditionally defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms that arose from an IgE-mediated allergic reaction which resulted in explosive release of vasoactive mediators from mast cells and basophils throughout the body. However, the definition of anaphylaxis has been expanded in recent years to include any reaction that leads to widespread activation of mast cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This more inclusive definition emphasizes the common endpoint of mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/basophil</span> activation and the severity of the reactions that can result and places less importance on the mechanism by which the cells are activated. Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis (from any cause) have been proposed by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, clinicians should not equate anaphylaxis with anaphylactic shock, as the latter represents the severe end of a spectrum. The goal should be early recognition and appropriate management of anaphylaxis in its milder forms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All reactions with features of anaphylaxis should be considered potentially severe because of the tendency of anaphylaxis to recur and worsen with reexposure to the causative agent. As an example, a patient who develops limited urticaria and mild wheezing after receiving a medication should be presumed to have anaphylaxis and should not be considered a candidate for premedication and drug readministration at a slower rate of infusion. Instead, referral to an allergist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use of a desensitization protocol should be pursued. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Agents that can cause anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>In this topic review, as mentioned previously, anaphylaxis will be referred to as such, and all other infusion reactions will be grouped under the term standard infusion reactions (SIRs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence that a reaction was anaphylaxis can be obtained from blood tests collected at the time of the reaction and from skin testing, a technique employed by allergy specialists to identify drugs which are capable of causing mast cell activation, especially through IgE-mediated immune mechanisms. These two diagnostic tools are discussed in this section.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum tests that support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis &mdash; Mast cells and basophils contain various chemical mediators that are transiently released into the circulation during anaphylaxis. Some of these are unique to these cell types and, if elevated, can help confirm that the reaction was anaphylaxis. The finding of an elevated tryptase level suggests that the reaction was anaphylaxis, rather than a severe SIR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The laboratory test that is most useful in this setting is a serum total tryptase level. Tryptase levels usually peak within three hours of the onset of symptoms, so blood should be drawn shortly after the reaction occurs. Blood can be collected in a standard red top tube and serum should be frozen if it cannot be assayed promptly. Tryptase in frozen serum is stable for up to one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The upper limit of normal for serum total tryptase is 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/ml,</span> depending on the assay system. Elevations in anaphylaxis can range from marginally elevated to greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Any elevation in serum tryptase is consistent with anaphylaxis, although a normal tryptase level does not exclude anaphylaxis because tryptase elevations are not seen in all anaphylactic reactions. The interpretation of tryptase levels in anaphylaxis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a patient's reaction was suggestive of anaphylaxis but tryptase levels were not elevated, skin testing may still be informative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing to evaluate anaphylaxis &mdash; Skin testing is a technique used by allergy specialists to determine if a drug is capable of activating mast cells in the skin and therefore potentially able to cause anaphylaxis if administered systemically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Skin testing for drug allergy is generally performed by <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> specialists, who have specific training in the technique, proper interpretation of results, and management of the rare allergic reactions that occur in response to the testing itself. Despite this, a few oncology centers perform this testing and have acquired some experience with testing for specific drugs, although this is not a widespread practice. The technique of skin testing is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Agents that can cause anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some MoAbs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>) are believed to cause true IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. The best characterized is cetuximab, which has been associated with immediate and severe bronchospasm and hypotension requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and admission to the intensive care unit despite premedication with antihistamines with or without a glucocorticoid. These reactions are much more prevalent in some areas of the southeastern US, and investigations into the reasons for this has revealed that patients living in these areas are more likely to have preexisting IgE antibodies that are specific for galactose-alpha-1,3 galactose, which is present on the Fab portion of the cetuximab heavy chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14085633\" class=\"local\">'Cetuximab'</a> below.)</p><p>MoAbs with a high frequency of infusion reactions on first exposure (eg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) have been presumed to be non-IgE dependent because of the lack of prior exposure and the low immunogenicity of humanized MoAbs. However, the demonstration of preexisting IgE anti-polysaccharide antibodies in patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> reactions (discussed above) raises questions about whether similar mechanisms may underlie other MoAb-associated infusion reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF INFUSION REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most recent version of the <a href=\"https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm&amp;token=L1PKi7ksomh1JqUfTKWNe61gdDEj7/EN0gFsM2jnisnZ9aDYBZ/nKF0Y6hAnywy9MOvaze9hPSMvHYdMdeBk6asiYcR9Y9yHOUcUYVkBUtI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2811\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)</a> for grading adverse reactions during chemotherapy administration has a scale for grading the severity of infusion reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57843 \">table 2</a>) as well as separate grading scales for allergic reactions from non-infusional drugs and anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91249 \">table 3</a>). There is also a separate grading scale for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially life-threatening toxicity that has been observed following administration of natural and bispecific antibodies (eg, blinatumumab) and following adoptive T-cell therapies for cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F114251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114251 \">table 4</a>).

The severity of the reaction is considered separately. This approach is intended to identify patients at risk for anaphylaxis on re-exposure, regardless of the severity of the initial reaction.</p><p>Patients with even mild symptoms of mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/basophil</span> activation (eg, urticaria and dyspnea) must be treated with caution, because reexposure to the causative agent could result in a fulminant and severe anaphylaxis. One of the authors (MC) is aware of unpublished cases in which failure to recognize anaphylaxis and manage it appropriately led to fatalities upon reexposure to the causative drug, despite the premedications and reduced infusion rates that would have adequately managed most SIRs.</p><p>Thus, oncology specialists should be familiar with the characteristics of anaphylactic reactions and manage these rare reactions differently from SIRs. We recommend that patients with even mild signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis not be reexposed to the causative agent until they have been evaluated by an allergy specialist with experience in drug allergy and desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In particular, these patients should NOT be considered candidates for additional premedication and an attempt at drug readministration using a slower rate of infusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF PREMEDICATION TO PREVENT INFUSION REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication can help prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce the severity of infusion reactions, particularly standard infusion reactions (SIRs). In contrast, anaphylaxis is generally not prevented by premedication, although the severity of the reaction may be reduced in some cases. Attempts to identify patients who are likely to develop infusion reactions have met with limited success.</p><p>Pharmacologic prophylaxis with antihistamines and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, with or without glucocorticoids, is recommended for certain drugs that are associated with a high incidence of infusion reactions (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemtuzumab ozogamicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> [in patients who reside in certain geographic areas]). However, these regimens have been empirically derived rather than established through randomized trials. Furthermore, they are not completely protective, even for SIRs. Therefore, despite the use of premedication, patients must be monitored closely during and immediately following all infusions.</p><p>Because infusion reactions are most common during the first or second exposures, many clinicians eliminate premedication after the first two courses if there has not been a reaction. However, as noted above, between 10 and 30 percent of infusion reactions with these agents occur after the first two courses of therapy. In some institutions, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, a sedating antihistamine, is replaced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, a nonsedating antihistamine, in patients who do not experience an infusion reaction during the first drug infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT AND RECHALLENGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should be prepared for a reaction to occur during each drug administration, and standing orders should be in place to allow immediate intervention if an infusion reaction occurs, without waiting for the clinician to arrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

However, the decision depends on whether the risk for a serious recurrent reaction is felt to be outweighed by mitigating clinical factors (ie, the potential clinical benefit of further treatment and no other reasonable alternatives). Examples at either end of the spectrum might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits of continued drug treatment probably outweigh the risks of rechallenge for a woman receiving adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> for a HER2-positive early breast cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, drug substitution rather than rechallenge would be more appropriate for a patient who develops an SIR while receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> as a second-line agent for metastatic colorectal cancer</p><p/><p>If a patient is felt to be a candidate for continuation of therapy because of the potential for clinical benefit and no other reasonable alternatives exist, then rechallenge may be pursued. In most cases, the mechanism of severe SIRs is not known, and so it is difficult to predict the best technique for preventing recurrence. However, we suggest the use of a &quot;desensitization&quot; protocol, in which the drug is readministered in a highly controlled manner, in sequential steps of gradually increasing dose. At the author's institution (MC), these reactions are managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis, with uniformly good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Management after anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rechallenge should not be attempted for suspected anaphylaxis. Instead, we suggest referral to an allergy specialist or an oncology center with experience in drug desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although this is NOT recommended, there may be instances in which a patient with an apparent episode of anaphylaxis was rechallenged shortly after the reaction (eg, 30 minutes after symptoms have resolved) and appeared to tolerate the reinfusion. This situation can be misinterpreted as evidence that the reaction was not anaphylaxis or as an indication that the patient can receive additional courses safely in the future using standard administration. However, we urge caution in this situation. Mast cells and basophils, the cells involved in anaphylaxis, can be temporarily desensitized immediately after a reaction and may be unable to be activated further. However, the patient is at high risk for a recurrence of anaphylaxis as soon as the cells have recovered their sensitivity, a process which takes days to weeks. This phenomenon has probably contributed to the confusion that currently exists in the medical literature about the safety of rechallenge following a severe infusion reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization is indicated for allergic infusion reactions that have features of anaphylaxis. The technique can also be applied to severe SIRs that recur despite slower rates of infusion and premedications. Important points regarding this technique include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization is absolutely contraindicated in patients with a history of a blistering dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis to a MoAb or other biologic modifier.

Allergists should be involved in the initial evaluation and qualification of patients for desensitization.</p><p/><p>Drug desensitization protocols are based upon administering increasing doses of medication in a stepwise manner, such that exposure is continuous, begins at very low doses, and increases gradually. The protocols presented herein have been performed successfully in published reports, although modifications may be needed in individual cases and experience with the technique is essential. Clinicians should avoid altering successful protocols to render them faster or significantly change the time interval between doses.</p><p>Drug desensitization induces a state of temporary tolerance that is dependent on continuous drug exposure. Once the drug is cleared from the system, the state of tolerance is lost. Therefore, patients must be carefully counseled that they remain allergic to the drug and must be desensitized for each subsequent administration. At some institutions, initial desensitizations are carried out in the medical intensive care unit. If the procedure is well tolerated, subsequent desensitizations are performed on standard hospital floors or in hospital-associated infusion units.</p><p>Successful desensitizations to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Most reactions (&gt;90 percent) occur with the first dose, although some occur after several doses, underscoring the need to monitor patients for one hour after each drug infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14085718\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of infusion reactions has been variable in different geographic areas.

In a series of patients living in the southeast US who experienced severe reactions to cetuximab, <span class=\"nowrap\">17/25</span> were found to have IgE antibodies in pre-treatment serum that were specific for galactose-alpha-1,3 galactose, an oligosaccharide present on the Fab portion of the cetuximab heavy chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

There is some evidence to suggest that patients develop IgE antibodies to galactose-alpha-1,3 galactose as a result of tick bites, as the distribution of patients with cetuximab reactions is similar to that of the Lone Star species of tick found in the southeastern US, and many patients have reported reactions following a series of tick bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In the absence of a reaction during the initial 30 minutes, the rate of infusion could be increased and the remainder of the dose administered over 90 minutes. Patients with pruritus, hives, or any allergic symptom during the initial 30 minutes should have the infusion stopped, have their skin tested within two weeks, and if positive, can be candidates for rapid desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The US FDA-approved manufacturer's package insert recommends premedication with an H1 antagonist 30 to 60 minutes prior to the first dose.

All subsequent cycles of rituximab can be administered over 90 minutes, with 20 percent of the dose given in the first 30 minutes, and the remainder over the next 60 minutes. The safety of this approach was shown in the phase III RATE trial, in which 363 previously untreated patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who did not experience a grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction to rituximab (in combination with one of two different chemotherapy regimens, CHOP versus CVP) during cycle 1 all received a faster infusion in cycle 2, and if well-tolerated, all subsequent cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Twenty percent of the total dose was administered in the first 30 minutes, and if tolerated, the remainder was administered over 60 minutes. The incidence of grade 3 infusion-related reactions during cycle 2 was 1.1 percent (95% CI 0.3-2.8). Based upon these results, the FDA approved a 90-minute infusion for rituximab starting at cycle 2 for patients with NHL who did not experience a grade 3 or 4 infusion-related adverse reaction during cycle 1.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>There is a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild fever and chills to life-threatening anaphylaxis with bronchospasm, and hypotension. Infusion reactions are most likely during the first or second infusion; however, between 10 and 30 percent of reactions occur during subsequent courses of therapy, so the clinician must remain vigilant for these reactions with every administration. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>The mechanism underlying MoAb-related infusion reactions is unclear, but most are thought to be related to antigen-antibody interactions precipitating cytokine release. Anaphylaxis is uncommon, but has been reported primarily with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>The allergists' approach to classifying infusion reactions emphasizes the differentiation of anaphylaxis from all other types of infusion reactions (termed standard infusion reactions [SIRs]), regardless of severity. Characteristic symptoms of anaphylaxis include urticaria, wheezing, hypotension, and gastrointestinal symptoms but not fever. The distinction between anaphylaxis and other reactions is emphasized because anaphylaxis is likely to recur despite premedication and typically becomes more severe upon reexposure. For these reasons, patients with symptoms of anaphylaxis (even if mild) should not be reexposed to the drug until they have been evaluated by an allergist or oncologist with experience in drug allergy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Classification of infusion reactions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For certain agents, specific prophylactic maneuvers can be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic prophylaxis with a histamine H1 receptor antagonist is recommended prior to each infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramucirumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramucirumab</a>.

Since infusion reactions are most likely during the first or second infusion, many clinicians eliminate routine premedication after the first two exposures if there has not been a reaction. However, as noted above, reactions can also occur with later courses of therapy. Specific premedication regimens for individual agents are addressed in the sections that discuss these agents above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, more severe infusion reactions should be anticipated if there are high levels of circulating malignant cells, as with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or mantle cell lymphoma. In such cases, fractionation of the rituximab dose (ie, 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m2</span> on day 1, and the remainder of the dose administered on day 3) with premedication is advisable.

Serious adverse events that may be associated with CRS include pyrexia, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, and elevations in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin.

Pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 20 mg intravenously is recommended prior to the first dose of each cycle, prior to each intracycle dose increase (eg, as occurs on cycle 1 day 8), or when restarting an infusion after an interruption of four or more hours. (See <a href=\"#H14085090\" class=\"local\">'Blinatumomab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Despite premedication, clinicians must be prepared for an infusion reaction to occur during each drug administration.
