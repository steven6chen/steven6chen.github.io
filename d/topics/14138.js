The lap belt is placed across the hips and below the uterus; the shoulder belt goes between the breasts and lateral to the uterus. Although there are case reports of maternal and fetal injuries resulting from seat belt use, the overall effect is that seat belts provide significantly more benefit than risk to the mother and fetus in the event of collision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>There is less evidence regarding the effects of air bags. The largest study was a retrospective cohort study that assessed the effect of air-bag availability and air-bag deployment on the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in over 3000 pregnant, front-seat occupants in motor vehicle crashes in Washington State [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Almost all of the women wore seat belts; two-thirds were in air bag equipped vehicles and one-third of the women were in vehicles without airbags. For the entire cohort, the authors did not find a statistically significant association between the presence of an air bag in the vehicle and risk of any adverse maternal or perinatal outcome in the event of a crash. When they compared only those crashes where an air bag deployed to those where it would have been likely to deploy if the vehicle was equipped with one, they found air bag deployment was associated with a trend toward increased preterm labor (relative risk [RR] 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-3.2), but not preterm birth (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3-1.9). The number of women with placental abruption or fetal death was too small to provide meaningful comparisons (abruption <span class=\"nowrap\">4/198</span> with airbag deployed versus <span class=\"nowrap\">10/622</span> without deployed air bag; fetal death <span class=\"nowrap\">2/198</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">2/622)</span>.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant occupants of motor vehicles wear lap and shoulder seatbelts and should not turn off air bags [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3673809435\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral health</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral conditions should not be deferred because of pregnancy.

In general, exposure of a pregnant woman to the hypoxia of high altitude results in acclimatization responses, which preserve the fetal oxygen supply.

Epidemiologic studies have reported an association between in utero acetaminophen exposure and risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity</span> disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors at ages 7 and 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. However, the absolute risk was small and these studies have several methodologic limitations including a lack of assessment of overall health for the index pregnancy, lack of information on acetaminophen strength and dosage units taken, and lack of formal assessment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. </p><p>A 2015 US Food and Drug Administration Drug Safety Communication assessed the available evidence to be inconclusive regarding a possible connection between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> use in pregnancy and ADHD in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Similarly, a 2017 review by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine reported that no conclusion could be made regarding a possible causal association between maternal acetaminophen use and neurobehavioral issues because of aforementioned study limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Subsequent to these communications, a study from Norway that adjusted for maternal use of acetaminophen before pregnancy, familial risk for ADHD, and indications of acetaminophen use reported an increased risk of ADHD with acetaminophen use &gt;29 days: HR 2.20 (95% CI 1.50-3.24), while use for &lt;8 days was negatively associated with ADHD: HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.81-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Moreover, paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen were similarly associated with ADHD. These data may reassure women who require only a few doses of acetaminophen for treatment of fever or pain during pregnancy.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies have also suggested a small, but statistically significant, association between maternal use of mild analgesics and cryptorchidism in offspring, particularly second trimester or prolonged exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> may also reduce fetal testosterone production.

As with most other drugs, it is reasonable to avoid prolonged use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, if possible, until more data are available. Since descent of the testes occurs in late gestation, first trimester avoidance of acetaminophen will not address this potential problem.</p><p>It is possible that reduction of fever with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> reduces the risk of some birth defects, but further study is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The extensive use of acetaminophen by pregnant women combined with the paucity of documented adverse effects has served to make this medication the pain reliever and antipyretic of choice during pregnancy when short-term drug therapy is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>However, it is important to caution patients against excessive use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. The therapeutic dose is 325 to 1000 mg per dose in adults, with a usual maximum recommended daily dose of about 3 g for oral immediate release preparations. Accidental overuse may be more likely in pregnancy due to limitations on use of other medications and perceptions of its safety. Limited data suggest good fetal outcomes in cases of maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">overdose/overuse,</span> but potential for maternal morbidity is high.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal abstinence syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The safety of short-term opioid use is also unclear. Data from an animal study support an association between maternal opioid use and central nervous system defects in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Three epidemiologic studies in humans have also reported an association with neural tube defects, with odds ratios of 1.7 to 2.9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. An association has also been reported between opioid use in pregnancy and congenital heart defects, and gastroschisis; preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, and stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/82,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,85</a>]. In most cases, opioids were used for short-term analgesia. Limitations of these studies include that exposure information was based on maternal recall up to one year after delivery, information on drug dose and duration was not obtained, the drugs were used to treat pain from a wide variety of disorders, many of the narcotics were part of a multi-component drug regimen, congenital abnormalities in pregnancy losses were not ascertained, and the possibility of chance associations is increased when multiple comparisons are made. Even in the large studies, the number of cases was small and subject to selection bias. A 2015 US FDA Safety Announcement stated further investigation of this issue is needed before we can determine whether the weight of evidence supports the presence of an increased risk of neural tube defects related to opioid exposure in early pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The absolute risk of open neural tube defects is low in the United States, about three per 10,000 live births.

For each birth defect, only between 4 and 21 infants were exposed to one of the antibiotics and some patients in the study were exposed to more than one potential teratogen. For both studies, long periods between the exposure and patient interviews (six weeks to two years), recall bias, and inability to determine if the birth defects were related to the infection rather than the treatment further limit these findings. In contrast, a population-based cohort study from Norway found no significant association between filling a nitrofurantoin prescription in the first trimester and risk of congenital malformations (all, major, or cardiovascular) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sulfonamides compete with bilirubin for albumin binding sites and theoretically may increase the risk of kernicterus at low bilirubin levels. For this reason, these drugs have been avoided near delivery if another antibiotic is available. However, a systematic review found no cases of kernicterus associated with maternal use of sulfonamides during pregnancy or lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. A subsequent study reported the presumed association between maternal use of sulfamethizole and neonatal jaundice was the result of preterm birth; the association became insignificant when data were adjusted for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Another study described an increased risk of kernicterus in preterm infants administered sulfisoxazole for antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2681919019\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold and allergy medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of over-the-counter and prescription drugs for treatment of respiratory infections and allergies in pregnancy is discussed in detail elsewhere.
