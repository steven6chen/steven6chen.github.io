Evidence for this relationship was first provided in 1906 by James Homer Wright, who demonstrated that circulating platelets and a giant bone marrow cell now known to be the megakaryocyte shared common tinctorial properties when subjected to a modified Romanofsky stain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67199 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Wright went on to show that megakaryocytes sent out pseudopodia into the bone marrow sinusoids from which platelets appeared to be shed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This model of how megakaryocytes produce platelets remains with us to this day. Wright also demonstrated in normal and abnormal human physiology that changes in platelet number were associated only with changes in the megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Since these seminal observations, much has become known about megakaryocytes and how they produce platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The characteristics of megakaryocytes, how they regulate platelet production, and their role in pathologic processes will be described here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In lower vertebrate species such as fish and birds, all the circulating blood cells, including the erythrocytes and the platelets (called thrombocytes), are nucleated and are produced by diploid bone precursor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, in higher vertebrates, platelets are produced by a different mechanism whose evolutionary advantage is unclear. Enucleate platelets are generated from bone marrow megakaryocytes that have a number of unique properties.</p><p>In humans, megakaryocytes normally account for approximately 0.05 to 0.1 percent of all nucleated bone marrow cells. Their number increases as the demand for platelets rises. In contrast to the erythrocyte, which has a diameter of 7 to 8 microns and a volume of 85 to 100 fL, megakaryocytes have an average diameter of 20 to 25 microns and a volume of 4700 &plusmn; 100 fL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50650 \">picture 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some of the largest megakaryocytes have diameters of 50 to 60 microns and volumes of 65,000 to 100,000 fL.</p><p>Each megakaryocyte produces a total of 1000 to 3000 platelets. Although it has long been assumed that larger megakaryocytes make more platelets, this has never been conclusively demonstrated.</p><p>Mature megakaryocytes are invariably polyploid and contain from two (4N) to 32 (64N) times the normal diploid amount of DNA; the mean value is 16N in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This polyploidy appears to result in functional gene amplification, perhaps to increase protein synthesis in parallel with megakaryocyte enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Few other cells are normally polyploid (eg, occasional hepatocytes and macrophages have 4N or 8N DNA content).</p><p>Unlike the polyploid hepatocytes and macrophages, whose DNA is contained in multiple separate nuclei, the DNA in the megakaryocytes is contained within one highly lobulated nuclear envelope in which each lobule represents one diploid amount (2N) of DNA. This is the result of a process referred to as endomitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Surface membrane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The megakaryocyte surface membrane is similar to that of the platelet. One of the first signs of differentiation along the megakaryocyte lineage is the appearance on the surface of the megakaryocyte of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> and later by GPIb and collagen receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The megakaryocyte has a demarcation membrane system in which the surface membrane of the mature megakaryocyte is deeply invaginated and highly redundant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81336\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81336 \">picture 3</a>). This enormous amplification of the surface membrane is thought to be the means by which an adequate amount of platelet surface membrane is created and subsequently used to form platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific platelet granules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since platelets undergo little protein synthesis, their cytoplasmic characteristics are mostly determined by the megakaryocytes from which they arise. The membrane bodies of the alpha and dense platelet granules and some of their contents are made in megakaryocytes. However, some of the granule contents are actually taken up from the plasma by both megakaryocytes and platelets.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha granules of platelets contain numerous platelet proteins and growth factors. The granule body itself is made early in megakaryocyte development before the demarcation membrane system. Some of the granule contents such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, platelet factor-4, and von Willebrand factor are synthesized in the megakaryocyte and transported to the alpha granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, other proteins enter the alpha granules of both megakaryocytes and platelets from the plasma via <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptor-mediated endocytosis (eg, fibrinogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>] or pinocytosis (eg, albumin and IgG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dense granules of platelets are physically dense and, because they contain serotonin and calcium, are also electron dense when seen with the transmission electron microscope. The dense granule membrane bodies are made in megakaryocytes but do not acquire their content of serotonin and calcium until platelets are released into the circulation where they take up calcium and most of the body's circulating serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopic appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large, mature, polyploid megakaryocytes are readily identified by light microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67199 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50650 \">picture 2</a>). On occasion, they can be seen to be shedding platelets.</p><p>In addition to the mature megakaryocytes, three other stages of megakaryocytes may be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Intermediate megakaryocytes have large polyploid nuclei but a modest amount of cytoplasm; they can be distinguished from immature megakaryocytes which have scant cytoplasm and large, basophilic nuclei. Also present, but identified only by special stains for von Willebrand factor or glycoprotein (GP) <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa,</span> are small, diploid, lymphocyte-like megakaryocyte progenitor cells that have not yet undergone endomitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ORIGIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like all other bone marrow cells, megakaryocytes are derived from the multipotent stem cell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74886 \">figure 1</a>). The stem cell gives rise to early bilineage progenitors (megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, BEP) that are subsequently able to undergo erythrocyte or megakaryocyte differentiation. Although there is no specific assay for this common megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cell, its existence is supported by several lines of evidence.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In mice in which the thymidine kinase gene was expressed under the control of the GPIIb promoter, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> (which is converted to the toxic monophosphate by thymidine kinase) resulted in eradication of both megakaryocyte and erythroid progenitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This observation suggests that the GPIIb promoter was transcriptionally active in this bipotential progenitor cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and possibly in a more potent progenitor cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>There is a close relationship between early erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation at the molecular, cellular, and pathological levels. As an example, common transcription factors exist in these two lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and their regulatory hematopoietic cytokines, erythropoietin and thrombopoietin, are 50 percent similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been demonstrated that a microRNA, miR-150, is important in the lineage specification that occurs to this common megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cell. When present, miR-150 drives differentiation towards megakaryocytes and away from erythroid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The transcription factor Myb is a critical target of miR-150 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thrombopoietin increases miR-150, which in turn binds to the 4 miR-150 binding sites on the c-Myb 3'UTR and decreases Myb mRNA and protein. Reduction in Myb expression subsequently leads to increased megakaryocyte differentiation and reduced erythroid differentiation. When miR-150 is absent, erythroid differentiation occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Ultimately the differentiation process produces a precursor cell committed only to megakaryocyte differentiation called the megakaryocyte colony-forming cell (Meg-CFC), which can be assayed by cell culture methods. This cell expresses some megakaryocyte properties such as the presence of glycoprotein (GP) <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] and undergoes mitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It is stimulated by interleukin (IL-3) and thrombopoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>Eventually the Meg-CFC stops mitosis and enters endomitosis in which DNA replication continues, but neither the nucleus nor the cell undergoes division (cytokinesis). Polyploid precursors with scant cytoplasm are produced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74886 \">figure 1</a>). It was initially assumed that endomitosis was simply the absence of mitosis after each round of DNA replication. However, studies in mice showed that megakaryocytes enter mitosis and progress through normal prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, and up to anaphase A, but not to anaphase B, telophase, or cytokinesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. After anaphase, the nuclear membrane is reassembled about the sister chromatids as a single nucleus skipping telophase and cytokinesis; the cells then enter the next round of DNA replication.</p><p>Genes with known roles in regulating the cell cycle such as the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the cyclins have been studied. Although the results are incomplete, endomitosis is associated with increased cyclin D3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and reduced levels of cyclin B1 and cyclin B1-dependent Cdc2 kinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These events may allow the megakaryocyte to abort mitosis and reenter a phase of DNA replication without cytokinesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Upon the completion of endomitosis, the immature megakaryocytes develop a mature cytoplasm, become morphologically identifiable, and eventually release platelets. Overall, it takes approximately five to seven days to progress from the megakaryocyte colony-forming cell (Meg-CFC) to the platelet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombopoietin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombopoietin has a major effect on almost all steps of megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation. It promotes the growth of Meg-CFC, dramatically increases the rate of endomitosis, inhibits apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], and stimulates megakaryocyte maturation. An increase in megakaryocyte ploidy is seen at even the lowest amounts of thrombopoietin and is one of the most prominent effects of thrombopoietin. Other cytokines such as IL-3 and IL-11 can also promote Meg-CFC growth and megakaryocyte maturation but have little effect on endomitosis; their actions may not be important in normal physiology. However, the final stage of platelet release is not dependent on thrombopoietin and in one model system was actually inhibited by large amounts of thrombopoietin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The molecular mechanisms by which cells become committed to the megakaryocyte lineage are just starting to be unraveled. Unlike thrombopoietin, which appears to prevent apoptosis and stimulate growth of cells already committed to megakaryocyte differentiation, intrinsic lineage-specific transcription factors are expressed in cells and then establish cell-specific phenotypes. The transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 are important for megakaryocyte development. What lineage-specific genes are controlled by these factors remains unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">GATA-1 transcription factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GATA-1 is zinc-finger transcription factor which is expressed in erythroid, megakaryocyte, eosinophil, and mast cells. Elimination of the entire GATA-1 gene results in embryonic death due to severe anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Since GATA-1 is found in the megakaryocyte and GATA-1 binding sites are found on many megakaryocyte and platelet genes, it was anticipated that GATA-1 played a role in megakaryocyte proliferation and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. When a unique portion of the GATA-1 promoter was disrupted, GATA-1 expression was eliminated in megakaryocytes but not in erythrocytes. These nonanemic animals had a platelet count 15 percent of normal and an increased number of small, abnormal megakaryocytes with multilobulated nuclei, scant cytoplasm, few demarcation membranes, no platelet &quot;territories,&quot; and few platelet granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. These findings suggest an early defect in cytoplasmic maturation, with a subsequent fall in platelet production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;, section on 'GATA1'</a>.)</p><p>Numerous genes are downregulated by the loss of GATA-1 in mice, including JAK2 and STAT-1, which mediate thrombopoietin and interferon-gamma (IF-gamma) signaling pathways, respectively. It has been suggested that GATA-1 promotes megakaryopoiesis in part via activation of <span class=\"nowrap\">IF-gamma/STAT1</span> signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], possibly explaining the mechanism by which various inflammatory disorders can cause elevated platelet counts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">NF-E2 transcription factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NF-E2 (nuclear factor erythroid derived 2) is a heterodimeric basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is composed of a widely expressed p18 subunit and a p45 subunit present only in erythroid, megakaryocyte, and mast cells. When NF-E2 is disrupted, mice develop a mild anemia and a profound thrombocytopenia associated with a high rate of early hemorrhagic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. These mice have adequate numbers of large, abnormal megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei, rare granules, adequate amounts of demarcation membranes, but no platelet &quot;territories.&quot; In addition, they never produce proplatelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Proplatelets are elongated strands of megakaryocyte cytoplasm that are larger than normal platelets and later fragment into a number of platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Thus, NF-E2 appears to affect megakaryocyte cytoplasmic differentiation and platelet production at a somewhat later step than GATA-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PLATELET FORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although historically one of the first observations was the apparent shedding of platelets by megakaryocytes, the mechanism by which platelets are produced is becoming clearer. Early electron microscopy images showed the megakaryocyte cytoplasm to be divided by the demarcation membrane system into future platelet &quot;territories&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81336\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81336 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, there was little evidence that megakaryocytes simply fractured into separate platelets in the bone marrow. Two different mechanisms have been proposed that have subsequently been merged into one complete model of platelet formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Megakaryocytes use the highly redundant demarcation membrane system to send out pseudopodia into the bone marrow sinusoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/14,15,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,54</a>]. Platelets and proplatelets then bud off, possibly as a result of localized caspase activation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73160\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73160 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The bone marrow sinusoids are lined by very thin endothelial cells that are tightly bound to each other and may even overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The megakaryocyte pseudopodia pass through, not between, the endothelial cells, which may in turn play some role in regulating the process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This is the mechanism initially suggested and most available data confirm many elements of this model:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mice recovering from severe thrombocytopenia have increased numbers of proplatelet processes in the sinusoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mice lacking the transcription factor NF-E2 have severe thrombocytopenia that is probably related to the inability of the megakaryocytes to form proplatelet processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/53,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,59</a>]. A similar defect occurs in mice with selective loss of the transcription factor GATA-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the molecular mechanisms that result in proplatelet formation from megakaryocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Cytoskeletal reorganization produces pseudopods by evagination of the demarcation membrane system; platelet granules then track into the elongating pseudopodia, and the proplatelet fragments are released.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chemoattractants such as stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1; also called CXCL12) induce metalloproteinase production by megakaryocytes that is necessary for transendothelial migration and platelet production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/45,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,61</a>]. Studies in animals have suggested that, while thrombopoietin (TPO) supports progenitor cell expansion, chemokine-mediated interaction of these progenitor cells with the bone marrow vascular niche allows them to relocate to a microenvironment that is permissive for megakaryocyte maturation and thrombopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Platelets contain many cytokines with inflammatory and fibrotic characteristics (eg, transforming growth factor beta [TGF-b], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12549620\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Megakaryocytes normally account for 0.05 to 0.1 percent of all nucleated bone marrow cells. They have an average diameter of 20 to 25 microns and a volume of 4700 &plusmn; 100 fL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50650 \">picture 2</a>). Each megakaryocyte is capable of producing 1000 to 3000 platelets. Mature megakaryocytes are invariably polyploid and contain from two (4N) to 32 (64N) times the normal diploid amount of DNA. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Origin and differentiation</strong> &ndash; Megakaryocytes are derived from the multipotent hematopoietic stem cell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74886 \">figure 1</a>), which gives rise to early progenitors able to undergo erythrocyte or megakaryocyte differentiation. A micro RNA miR-150 drives differentiation towards megakaryocytes. A number of factors affect this differentiation process, including thrombopoietin, GATA-1, and NF-E2. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Origin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differentiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Platelet formation and regulation </strong>&ndash; Cytoskeletal reorganization within the megakaryocyte produces pseudopodia by evagination of the demarcation membrane system. Platelet granules then track into the elongating pseudopodia, and proplatelet fragments are extruded into the circulation where they are transformed into mature platelets in both the bone marrow and the lungs. Thrombopoietin (TPO) produced by the liver enters the circulation where most is removed by TPO (c-mpl) receptors on normal platelets. Residual TPO provides basal stimulation of megakaryocytes and a basal rate of platelet production. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Platelet formation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Regulation of platelet production'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Altered megakaryocyte function</strong> &ndash; A number of disorders and clinical settings affect megakaryocyte and platelet production. These are discussed in the text as well as in other sections of UpToDate dealing with the specific disorders mentioned. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Megakaryocytes in disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wright JH.
