The FDA is requiring the manufacturer to conduct studies to see whether sodium polystyrene sulfonate affects absorption of other drugs. Until these data are available, the FDA suggests that the administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate be separated from other oral drugs by at least six hours.</p><p>In the past, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-polystyrene-sulfonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a> had been mixed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a> to prevent intestinal obstruction caused by fecal impaction, and constipation due to the concretion of the potassium polystyrene sulfonate complex. However, colonic necrosis and perforation have been reported in patients receiving this mixture, especially in the setting of post-gastrointestinal surgery or decreased colonic motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperkalemia-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In 2009, the FDA recommended that sodium polystyrene sulfonate should not be administered with sorbitol. As an alternative, patients can be given a laxative (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63381 \">table 2</a>)) to reduce the constipating effects of polystyrene sulfonates.</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-polystyrene-sulfonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a> without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a> is not available, clinicians must consider whether treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate in sorbitol is necessary.</p><p>Cation exchangers are not beneficial in the emergent setting, as they have limited or no short-term benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperkalemia-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Nevertheless, it is a reasonable to initiate cation exchange resin therapy as soon as possible, especially in cases with (or suspected to have) persistent hyperkalemia, as it is the only therapy short of dialysis that can remove potassium from the body in most hyperkalemic children. Cation exchange therapy is used in patients with persistently moderately elevated potassium (5.5 to 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">[mmol/L])</span> and as an adjunct for those with more severe hyperkalemia.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-polystyrene-sulfonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a> should not be given to the following patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Do not use SPS or other resins'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an ileus or who are receiving opiates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a large or small bowel obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of <strong>oral</strong> sodium polystyrene should be avoided in all term neonates.

It exchanges calcium ions for potassium and is approximately 10 times more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-polystyrene-sulfonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a> in potassium removal. However, pediatric data are not available. As a result, this agent is not suggested to be used in children until information regarding efficacy and safety is available. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate or ZS-9 is another cation exchange resin that is under consideration for FDA approval at this time.

Generally, hemodialysis is the preferred modality to reduce potassium levels, as it is the quickest and most controlled renal replacement treatment. Although peritoneal dialysis can be used, potassium removal is less efficient and less well controlled. In some centers, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be a better option than hemodialysis because of availability, resources, and staffing.
