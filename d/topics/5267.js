In healthy individuals, the ingestion of water does not lead to hyponatremia because suppressed release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin, allows excess water to be excreted in a dilute urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Renal water excretion is impaired in most patients who develop hyponatremia, usually due to an inability to suppress ADH secretion.

Many patients with hyponatremia have a single cause, but multiple factors sometimes contribute to the fall in plasma sodium.

Water can freely cross almost all cell membranes and moves from an area of lower tonicity (higher water content) to an area of higher tonicity (lower water content). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia without hypotonicity (including pseudohyponatremia)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The main difference between tonicity and osmolality is that tonicity reflects the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross cell membranes (mostly sodium salts with a small contribution from glucose) and therefore affect the movement of water between cells and the extracellular fluid. By contrast, osmolality also includes the osmotic contributions of urea and (if present) ethanol or other alcohols or glycols, which are considered &quot;ineffective&quot; osmoles since they can equilibrate across the cell membrane and therefore have little effect on water movement. (See <a href=\"#H1563385316\" class=\"local\">'Ineffective osmoles'</a> below.)</p><p>Hyperglycemia is a common cause of hypertonic hyponatremia. In patients with normal serum glucose, or in those whose serum sodium remains low after correcting for hyperglycemia, the serum osmolality should be measured if other causes of isotonic or hypertonic hyponatremia are suspected. As noted, such patients include (see <a href=\"#H1132962300\" class=\"local\">'Patients who might have isotonic or hypertonic hyponatremia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-without-hypotonicity-including-pseudohyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia without hypotonicity (including pseudohyponatremia)&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had recent transurethral prostate surgery or recent hysteroscopy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who were recently prescribed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, glycerol, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lipemic serum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with obstructive jaundice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a known or suspected plasma cell dyscrasia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1563385316\"><span class=\"h3\">Ineffective osmoles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The measured serum osmolality can sometimes be misleading, suggesting a diagnosis of hypertonic hyponatremia or isotonic hyponatremia in a patient who instead has hypotonic hyponatremia. This most commonly occurs with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Azotemia &ndash; Patients with advanced kidney disease may develop hyponatremia because their reduced renal function impairs their ability to excrete excess water. Although the low serum sodium concentration will tend to lower the serum osmolality, this effect is counterbalanced to a variable degree by azotemia, which increases the osmolality. Thus, the measured osmolality may be normal or elevated. However, despite the fact that high urea concentrations raise the osmolality, they do not increase tonicity. In contrast to sodium and glucose, urea is an ineffective osmole since it can freely cross cell membranes and therefore does not obligate water movement out of cells. Thus, patients with hyponatremia and renal failure have a low effective serum osmolality (ie, a low tonicity) that becomes apparent if the measured osmolality is corrected for the effect of urea:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"> &#160;Tonicity &#160;= &#160;Measured serum osmolality - (BUN &#160;&divide; &#160;2.8)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dividing the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) by 2.8 converts <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> of urea nitrogen into <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> of urea, which is required when calculating osmolality.

The reduction in the plasma osmolality resulting from the low serum sodium concentration can be offset in some patients by high circulating levels of ethanol. Ethanol, like urea, is an ineffective osmole since it can freely cross cell membranes and therefore does not obligate water movement out of cells. Thus, patients with hyponatremia and alcoholism may have a low serum sodium concentration and a low calculated serum osmolality, but a measured osmolality that is not low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In contrast to the utility of the urine sodium concentration, clinical assessment of volume status correctly identified only 48 percent of patients.</p><p>In addition to urine electrolytes, evaluation of the urine osmolality is helpful in patients who are suspected of having primary polydipsia or malnutrition as the cause of hyponatremia. Evaluation of acid-base and potassium balance may also be helpful, particularly in selected hyponatremic patients in whom the diagnosis is not apparent.

In patients with acute kidney injury, the FENa provides a more accurate assessment of volume status than the urine sodium concentration because it corrects for the effect that variations in urine volume have on the urine sodium. A FENa below 1 percent suggests effective volume depletion, while a value of approximately 2 percent suggests acute tubular necrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fractional excretion of sodium, urea, and other molecules in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This observation has led some clinicians to use the FENa in any situation in which measurement of the urine sodium concentration might be helpful.

The FENa is most useful in evaluating patients with oliguria to distinguish between prerenal azotemia and acute kidney injury; in this setting, a FENa below 1 percent is an indicator of effective volume depletion. A FENa below 1 percent is <strong>not </strong>an indicator of effective volume depletion in patients with normal or mild to moderate renal dysfunction who have a much higher GFR and a much greater filtered sodium load.</p><p>As an example, patients with a normal GFR of 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> (125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> have a filtered sodium load of approximately 27,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> at a normal serum sodium concentration. The FENa that is diagnostic of effective volume depletion may be as low as 0.1 percent, which represents the excretion of 27 mEq of sodium per day.

However, because hypothyroidism and hyponatremia are common findings in hospitalized patients, their coexistence may not necessarily be causal; other explanations for hyponatremia should still be sought unless hypothyroidism is severe. The evaluation of hypothyroidism is presented elsewhere.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency (hypopituitarism), in contrast to primary adrenal insufficiency (which also results in aldosterone deficiency), presents with euvolemic hyponatremia and biochemical features of SIADH. These issues, and the diagnosis of cortisol deficiency, are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-and-hyperkalemia-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1661680089\"><span class=\"h5\">Low urine sodium with high urine osmolality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some hyponatremic patients with apparent euvolemia have a low urine sodium and high urine osmolality. In such patients, serial measurement of the urine sodium and urine osmolality after infusion of isotonic saline (eg, one liter over one hour) can help to clarify the diagnosis. However, infusion of isotonic saline should be <strong>avoided or performed with extreme caution</strong> in patients with a very low serum sodium (eg, &lt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and in hyponatremic patients with severe hypokalemia, alcoholism, liver disease, or malnutrition because of the increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome with these disorders. If the hyponatremia is due to hypovolemia, isotonic saline reverses the stimulus to ADH secretion, which increases water excretion and produces overly rapid correction of the serum sodium. If, by contrast, the hyponatremia is due to SIADH, isotonic saline may further lower the serum sodium and thereby induce or exacerbate neurologic symptoms; the reason why isotonic saline can lower the serum sodium in patients with SIADH is presented elsewhere.

Although water retention tends to lower these values by dilution (as it does the plasma sodium and chloride concentrations), normal levels are restored by the factors that regulate acid-base and potassium balance. The release of potassium from cells in an attempt to minimize cell swelling induced by hypoosmolality is an additional factor that will raise the serum potassium concentration to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and increased acid excretion due to mild hyperaldosteronism induced by hyponatremia can raise the plasma bicarbonate concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>].

In healthy individuals, the ingestion of water does not lead to hyponatremia because suppressed release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin, allows excess water to be excreted in a dilute urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial diagnostic approach to the adult patient with hyponatremia consists of a directed history and physical examination as well as selected laboratory tests. When hyponatremia is first discovered, some elements of the history, key features of the physical exam, and the results of several helpful laboratory tests are usually already available, and these guide the subsequent diagnostic approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F101823\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101823 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1132962286\" class=\"local\">'The initial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1563384622\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1563384889\" class=\"local\">'Tests that are often initially available'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If hyperglycemia is present, the serum sodium concentration should be corrected for the effect of glucose to exclude hypertonic hyponatremia. To calculate the &quot;corrected&quot; serum sodium, we recommend the use of the following ratio: the sodium concentration will fall by approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for each 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> mL (5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> increase in glucose concentration.

This <strong>laboratory artifact</strong> can occur if the sodium is measured with flame photometry or indirect potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes when<strong> </strong>the solid phase portion of serum or plasma is increased due to severe elevations of triglycerides, lipoprotein-X, or protein. The true concentration of sodium in plasma water can be measured using direct ion-selective electrodes, which are not susceptible to the artifact. Such direct ion-selective electrodes are utilized by most &quot;point of care&quot; bedside analyzers and devices used to measure blood gases. In addition, patients with pseudohyponatremia typically have a normal serum osmolality. (See <a href=\"#H23083475\" class=\"local\">'Patients who might have pseudohyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have had recent surgery utilizing large volumes of electrolyte-poor irrigation fluid (eg, prostate or intrauterine procedures) and those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, glycerol, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> may have isotonic or hypertonic hyponatremia. Measurement of the plasma osmolality is helpful in these settings.

Both severely reduced GFR and thiazide (or thiazide-type) diuretics are important causes of hypotonic hyponatremia.

Most patients with hyponatremia due to true hypovolemia will have obvious signs of volume depletion; however, some hypovolemic patients have more subtle signs and are mistakenly judged to be euvolemic.

Measurement of the urine sodium and chloride concentrations can often distinguish between these two causes.
