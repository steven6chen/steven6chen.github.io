Yet the traditional treatment model for addiction has emphasized episodic intensive treatment for medically supervised substance withdrawal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stabilization, followed by time-limited outpatient care. In recent years, public and private health care systems and clinicians are coming to recognize that chronic or relapsing addiction, like chronic physical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, typically requires continuing, long-term care. </p><p>Continuing care for addiction includes routine assessment and treatment customized to the needs and preferences of the individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patient&rsquo;s clinical status and risk of relapse are monitored systematically and longitudinally. The intensiveness of treatment is adjusted as the addiction waxes and wanes over time. Patients receive training in self-management skills and linkage to other sources of professional and community support.</p><p>This topic describes indications for continuing care in chronic or relapsing addiction, components of continuing care, and the efficacy of multimodal continuing-care interventions. Other topics describe the implementation of continuing care in addiction, treatment issues specific to individual substance use disorders (SUDs), and determining the appropriate level of care for patients with SUDs.

After initial medically supervised substance withdrawal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stabilization at a higher level of care (eg, inpatient or residential), patients would typically receive a time-limited course of outpatient treatment. A national survey of outpatient SUD treatment programs found that the planned duration of outpatient care was most often 90 days, while the actual duration was less than 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Treatment has largely taken place in specialty addiction programs that employ a single modality of treatment, often without access to medication.</p><p>For many patients, however, addiction is a chronic or relapsing condition that lasts many years subsequent to diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Studies have found that 40 to 60 percent of patients treated for alcohol or other drug dependence return to regular use within a year following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>The conceptualization of addiction as a chronic disease is supported by comparison of its manifestations, course, etiologic factors (genetic and environmental), pathophysiology, and response to treatment with other chronic medical illnesses (eg, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Addiction causes predictable and persistent structural and functional changes in the brain. Volume loss of numerous types of brain tissue and structures has been found in alcohol dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], cocaine dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], opiate dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and polysubstance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Numerous neurotransmitter systems involved in reward and stress pathways in the brain are affected by chronic use of alcohol and other drugs, including dopamine and endogenous endorphins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Early onset addiction can severely disrupt the development of effective life skills in many areas of functioning, leading to chronic deficits. Even patients who achieve abstinence may have difficulty developing the kinds of meaningful and satisfying lives that can provide a buffer against relapse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894294449\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC CARE MODEL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Chronic Care Model, which has transformed the management of chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes in many health care systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], provides the conceptual foundation for continuing care for addiction. The model includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuing contact over time between patients and service providers, rather than short-term interventions during acute episodes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions to promote patient self-management of his or her addiction (see <a href=\"#H894295334\" class=\"local\">'Self management skills'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Links to patient oriented community resources (see <a href=\"#H2947777\" class=\"local\">'Linkages to other sources of support'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using accurate and timely patient data to monitor progress and guide intervention (see <a href=\"#H2948029\" class=\"local\">'Measuring and monitoring clinical status'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195604812\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF CONTINUING CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recognition that addiction is often chronic or relapsing has led to a gradual evolution in clinical management toward continuing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/7,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16-20</a>] with modifications in the intensiveness of treatment as the illness waxes and wanes over time. In contrast to traditional care for addiction, described above, continuing care is a more flexible approach to SUD care drawing on a full range of treatment modalities and intended for use in a wider range of settings, including primary care. Other components of continuing care include self-management skills, providing linkages to other sources of support, and <span class=\"nowrap\">measuring/monitoring</span> patients&rsquo; clinical status over time</p><p>The availability of continuing care for addiction varies widely in public and private sector health care systems in the United States and other countries. (See <a href=\"#H24243272\" class=\"local\">'Chronicity of addiction'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195601702\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuing care is indicated for patients with an addiction or a chronic, relapsing substance use disorder (SUD). In diagnostic terms, continuing care is for patients with a moderate-to-severe SUD, as diagnosed using DSM-5 criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients who have received treatment for a mild SUD are not typically candidates for continuing care. However, they should receive follow-up assessment during the year following treatment; continuing care may be indicated for those who relapse or experience a worsening of symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894294941\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment and customization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with chronic addiction vary in their clinical needs; some will require long-term, highly structured continuing care, whereas others will need very little treatment. In our clinical experience, patients are more likely to experience good outcomes when care is customized to meet patients&rsquo; clinical needs and preferences. </p><p>The intensiveness of care should be based on assessment of the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and risk of relapse. Assessment of patients with substance use disorders is described separately.

For some patients who experience addiction as a chronic illness, a focus on maintaining total abstinence may inhibit rather than facilitate long-term management of the condition. Treatment goals for these patients may more usefully focus on helping the patient minimize use and improve his or her personal and social functioning, despite the waxing and waning of substance use and associated symptoms over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202097389\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment modalities for addiction include counseling, psychotherapy, medications, and mutual help groups. Any combination of these modalities can be incorporated into continuing care. With the exception of treatment of opioid dependence with an opioid-agonist medication, continuing care research does not support the inclusion of specific modalities of treatment over others. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066156189\"><span class=\"h3\">Addiction counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Alcohol/drug</span> counseling is a broadly used term to describe individual and group therapies that aim to help patients reduce substance use.

Counseling is provided in increasingly diverse formats that vary in intensiveness, for example, face-to-face or by telephone, individual or group sessions. The duration of a counseling session is typically between 30 to 60 minutes for individual sessions and 60-90 minutes for groups, while the duration of a brief check-in is typically 15 to 30 minutes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H431199146\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychotherapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific psychotherapies, including cognitive and behavioral therapies, 12-step facilitation, coping skills therapy, and family and couples therapy, have been shown to have some degree of efficacy in SUDs.

Two randomized trials found that patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment experienced better opioid use outcomes compared with medically supervised withdrawal followed by drug-free continuing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

While clinical trials comparing medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acamprosate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acamprosate</a>) with placebo in alcohol dependence have shown largely positive results, trials that compared combined medication and psychosocial interventions with either intervention alone have found mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>] but not all trials of extended care for alcohol dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] have found that extended care with naltrexone led to better substance use outcomes compared with extended care without naltrexone.

The intensiveness of treatment is reflected in the setting, staffing, and frequency with which treatment is provided. Common levels of care are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"#H894294941\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and customization'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining appropriate levels of care for treatment of substance use disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients may be more willing to initiate and sustain participation in continuing care when the participation is made more convenient and less burdensome than standard, clinic-based group counseling. Some continuing care programs have added additional, lower-intensity &ldquo;levels of care&rdquo; such as &ldquo;checkups&rdquo; (brief outpatient visits) or telephone-based contacts for patients who are interested in continued support but have completed standard outpatient treatment or do not want to continue to attend regular continuing care sessions at the clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Such low-intensity continuing care allows for regular assessment and, optimally, early detection of signs of potential relapse. (See <a href=\"#H1066154466\" class=\"local\">'Recovery management checkups'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1066154498\" class=\"local\">'Extended continuing care'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894295119\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuing care for relapsing addiction typically needs to be adjusted up or down in intensity and frequency over time as patients go through alternating periods of abstinence and use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/16,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,37</a>]. Brief, infrequent clinical contact may be sufficient during extended periods when a patient is doing well. However, when the patient&rsquo;s risk of relapse rises or an episode of substance use begins, treatment needs to be ratcheted up to a higher level of care (eg, more frequent sessions, additional modalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in a more intensive setting) that is adequate to interrupt and address the processes putting the patient at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Research indicates that for patients receiving outpatient treatment, the first few weeks are critical for determining the optimal intensity of continuing care. Patients who are able to stop using alcohol and drugs during these early weeks are likely to do well with less intensive continuing care, while patients who continue use are likely to require more intensive continuing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. </p><p>The failure to achieve other early treatment goals &mdash; such as committing to abstinence, attending AA meetings, developing better coping behaviors and increased confidence in their efficacy, and identifying reliable sources of social support &mdash; may also indicate a need for more intensive continuing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894295334\"><span class=\"h2\">Self management skills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of patients with a chronic condition such as addiction optimally includes preparing patients to manage their health and health care.

Tips for patients are also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Effective management of chronic addiction requires that patients are able to make good use of non-clinical supports, both within themselves and in the community. The ability to learn and to practice good &ldquo;self-care&rdquo; is as an important part of the management of chronic disorders of all types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One of the key goals is to equip patients to engage in healthy behaviors, such as a nutritious diet and exercise, and other basic tasks of good self-care. Although some of these tasks vary from disorder to disorder, they generally include </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-monitoring of status and symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping with stressors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interacting effectively with service providers and other sources of support</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8041679\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinician roles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuing care can be provided by a number of health care professionals who have received training in this area. Clinicians who have training in addictions treatment can obtain additional information on continuing care. The type of professional providing continuing care is best determined by the composition of the individual patient&rsquo;s SUD treatment. For patients treated in an addictions specialty care program, for example, the patient&rsquo;s addictions counselor would likely provide continuing care.</p><p>For patients whose SUD treatment is provided by a mental health clinic or psychiatry practice that is not addictions-specific, the nature of the patient&rsquo;s treatment (eg, individual or group counseling, medication, couples therapy) may determine the most appropriate provider of continuing care.</p><p>Other patients may be receiving SUD treatment from a primary care provider; in such cases the primary care clinician may be well situated to provide continuing care, particularly after the patient has reached some period of stable recovery. Some primary care settings have one or more clinicians who specialize to some degree in behavioral interventions for health conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66053234\"><span class=\"h3\">Care managers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Care management employs the strategies and principles of continuing care with the addition of care managers. Care managers actively follow a caseload of patients, conducting serial reassessments of each patient over time to assess <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> clinical status, risk of relapse, and response to treatment. Based on these assessments and in coordination with other team members, the care manager implements adjustments to treatment as clinically indicated, and provides coordination among SUD, medical and mental health care. The care manager encourages patients&rsquo; continuing participation in SUD treatment though regular phone and in-person contacts and other strategies.

Continuing care emphasizes ongoing monitoring with the intensiveness of treatment adjusted to the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and risk of relapse as the patient&rsquo;s addiction waxes and wanes over time. (See <a href=\"#H195604812\" class=\"local\">'Components of continuing care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with a mild SUD are not typically candidates for continuing care, but they should receive follow-up assessment during the year following treatment.
