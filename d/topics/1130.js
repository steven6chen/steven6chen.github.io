In patients with CMV colitis, conventional hematoxylin and eosin stains reveal enlarged (cytomegalic) cells that are often two- to fourfold larger than surrounding cells, usually with large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions, sometimes surrounded by a clear halo, and smaller cytoplasmic inclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adults-with-steroid-refractory-and-steroid-dependent-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Immunoperoxidase-staining can aid in the detection and should be done to confirm suspected CMV. A full colonoscopy with adequate evaluation of the terminal ileum (with biopsies of the ileum and throughout the colon in separate jars) may be helpful in excluding Crohn disease, which would have direct implications upon surgical options.

CT enterography has the advantage of better temporal resolution, mesenteric imaging, and shorter length of examination. It is preferred when there is a suspicion of an intra-abdominal abscess. MR enterography is gradually replacing CT enterography.

A number of small controlled trials and two meta-analyses have demonstrated that AZA is superior to placebo in maintenance of remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adults-with-steroid-refractory-and-steroid-dependent-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-30</a>]. A 2011 meta-analysis found that AZA was superior to placebo for preventing relapse (RR of relapse 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.95) and estimated that approximately four patients would need to be treated to prevent one relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-adults-with-steroid-refractory-and-steroid-dependent-ulcerative-colitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
