Its linear, double-stranded DNA genome of about 145 kb shows homologies to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Mature HHV-7 particles measure 170 nm in diameter, with nucleocapsids of 90 to 95 nm and a tegument of approximately 30 nm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Its DNA codes for 84 different proteins, including two major capsid proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Further analysis demonstrates that they encode functional calcium-mobilizing receptors for beta-chemokines, which include thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), EBI1-ligand chemokine (ELC), and secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>These ORFs encode a transmembrane glycoprotein (gB), which is thought to represent one of the HHV-7 envelope proteins involved in the adsorption of virus-to-cell surface proteoglycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These ORFs also encode two other glycoproteins (gH and gL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], a <span class=\"nowrap\">phosphotransferase/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a></span> kinase, a ribonucleotide reductase, a protease, and a heparin-binding gp 65 that may contribute to viral attachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

HHV-7 ORF U47 encodes gO-gH complex, which may have similar function to that in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and HHV-6, such as cell-to-cell fusion in viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>HHV-7 ORF U12 activates distinct transmembrane signaling pathways that may mediate biologic functions by binding with a beta-chemokine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, an HHV-7 glycoprotein U21 is an immunoevasin that binds to class I major histocompatibility complex molecules and diverts them to a lysosomal compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. U24, a protein common to roseola viruses that is known to downregulate the T cell receptor, has also been shown to downregulate a transferrin receptor, blocking early endosomal recycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which may play a role in perturbing the levels of proteins such as Nedd4 family E3 ubiquitin ligase, proteins that play a crucial role in dendrite outgrowth in the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Human antibodies raised in response to HHV-7 are directed against the immunodominant protein pp85 encoded by ORF (U14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell tropism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HHV-7 is a lymphotropic virus that replicates in CD4 T lymphocytes. It can be induced from latency within T cells by cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It can also be cultured in a CD4 lymphoblastic cell line (SupT1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23</a>], in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC), and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Its in vitro host-cell range is narrower than HHV-6. It does not infect certain CD4 cell lines such as Jurkat and H-9 HeLa-CD4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] but may be able to infect CD4-positive hematopoietic precursor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. HHV-7 has been detected in CD68+ <span class=\"nowrap\">monocyte/macrophage</span> associated with Kaposi's sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral entry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HHV-7, unlike HHV-6, utilizes CD4 as a cellular receptor for entry into cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. CD4 expression is necessary, but not sufficient, for infection of T cells, as evidenced by its inability to penetrate many cell lines expressing CD4 such as HeLa-CD4 or Jurkat.</p><p>Among other cofactors that might allow HHV-7 entry are cell-surface proteoglycans, which are capable of binding to HHV-7 glycoprotein B (gB) and are present on SupT1 cells but not on other CD4 T cell lines resistant to HHV-7 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. HHV-7 induces a profound downregulation of CD4 expression, which occurs six to nine days after infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] through a suppressive effect on CD4 transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, HHV-7 infection interferes with HIV-1 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/29,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34</a>]. HHV-7 does not require CXCR4 for entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] but may downregulate its expression with potential implications for HIV-1 coinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. HHV-7 infection may also reactivate HHV-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/22,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HHV-7 has a variety of effects on cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-7 is more cell associated, less cytopathic, and grows with slower kinetics in culture than HHV-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to HIV-1 and HHV-6, the cytopathic effect (CPE) of HHV-7 is characterized by membrane blebbing and the presence of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) that eventually undergo necrotic lysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/1,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-7 can induce apoptosis in a number of cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/33,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,40,41</a>], an effect that may be mediated via the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-7 can also support latent infection, as evidenced by the absence of viral transcripts the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors infected with HHV-7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunomodulatory effects on cytokines have been described in vitro, such as increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and interleukin (IL)-15 and a decrease in IL-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. No effect has been observed on IL-4 and IL-6. Recent ex vivo and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that HHV-7 down-modulates expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and beta-2 microglobulin. HHV-7 immunoevasin U21, a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-like protein, binds with high affinity to class I MHC molecules as a tetramer and escorts them to lysosomes, where they are degraded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This could help viral escape from host immune pressure and partly explain HHV-7 persistence in infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A possible case of germline HHV-7 integration has been identified using primers against the U90 ORF of HHV-7, suggesting that HHV-7 may behave like HHV-6 in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

More than 95 percent of adults are seropositive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Infection with HHV-7 generally occurs during childhood but peaks at a later age than infection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), usually around three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

It has also been isolated from cervical secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. HHV-7 DNA can be detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of most healthy adults at a level of approximately 300 copies per million cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], but infectious virus cannot be isolated from unstimulated PBMC cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-7-infection/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>].
