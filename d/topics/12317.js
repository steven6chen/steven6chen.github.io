Therefore, survivorship begins at the time of diagnosis and includes the periods of initial treatment with intent to cure, cancer-free survival, chronic or intermittent disease, and end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are now over 15 million cancer survivors in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and 32 million survivors worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For cancer survivors who are no longer in active treatment, health care needs include surveillance for recurrence, screening for the development of secondary cancers, monitoring and intervention for the long-term and late physical and psychologic effects of cancer and its treatment, management of comorbid medical conditions, as well as routine preventive and primary care. Unfortunately, there are few data available on how to best provide oncology and primary care in a coordinated and comprehensive fashion.</p><p>In this topic, we provide a broad overview of cancer survivorship care and address ways to enhance the care for cancer survivors. For this review, we will concentrate on the care of patients who have completed treatment with curative intent. A discussion on specific issues in cancer survivorship and topics related to patients with a specific diagnosis is addressed separately. Links to relevant topics are found at the end of this topic.

The frequency of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of diagnosis (2.1, 1.7, and 1.3 percent for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively), likely as a consequence of fewer individuals receiving radiation and lower doses of radiation administered over time.</p><p>In addition, cancer survivors may be at higher risk for second cancers related to lifestyle habits, such as smoking, as well as genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Oncology Group</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11934056\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The population of cancer survivors is growing and getting older. Surveillance for recurrences and other cancers, disease prevention, management of comorbid medical conditions, and monitoring for physical and psychologic effects of cancer treatment is needed. (See <a href=\"#H11933956\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following treatment of a primary cancer, survivors are at risk for both locoregional and metastatic recurrences. The timing and patterns of recurrence, particularly of distant disease, vary by cancer type and stage at diagnosis. In most instances, testing to evaluate for distant recurrent disease should not be performed in otherwise asymptomatic cancer survivors. (See <a href=\"#H11933979\" class=\"local\">'Risk of recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late effects of cancer treatment may include cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and <span class=\"nowrap\">infertility/menopause,</span> among others. Providers need to remain vigilant about signs and symptoms and offer evaluation promptly. (See <a href=\"#H418032179\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for late or long-term effects of cancer and its treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychologic effects of cancer are common, and may include depression, anxiety, fatigue, cognitive limitations, sleep problems, pain, and sexual dysfunction. Evaluation of symptoms and management is needed. Financial implications on care must be addressed. (See <a href=\"#H418032811\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial well-being'</a> above and <a href=\"#H418035393\" class=\"local\">'Fiscal well-being'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2190840755\" class=\"local\">'Fertility and parenthood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, healthy diet, exercise, and no more than moderate alcohol consumption, are important for cancer survivors. They have been shown to improve patient quality of life, risk of recurrences, and possibly mortality. (See <a href=\"#H11934000\" class=\"local\">'Preventive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers should inquire about family history of cancer in cancer survivors at the time of diagnosis and update this information over the course of follow-up. Patients with a personal or family history suggesting a potential familial cancer syndrome should be referred for genetic evaluation and testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordination with primary care, particularly for prevention, management of comorbid medical conditions, and psychosocial care, may be of benefit. Survivorship care plans are a tool to communicate and guide survivorship care. (See <a href=\"#H418030689\" class=\"local\">'Coordination of care'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Hewitt, M, Greenfield, S, Stovall, E, et al.
