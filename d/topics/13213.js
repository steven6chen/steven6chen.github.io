Pediatricians can help educate patients and families about pharmacotherapy and reinforce the need for adherence, and typically collaborate in evaluating patients prior to treatment and monitoring vital signs, weight, height, and waist size during treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121264208\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to commencing pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar disorder, clinicians should evaluate patients to establish the diagnosis and determine the treatment plan. The assessment may take several hours and multiple visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, children and adolescents may present with severe symptoms that require clinicians to initiate pharmacotherapy after an expedited evaluation, but before the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In these situations, family psychiatric history, prior treatment history, and burden of current manic or depressive symptoms can guide decisions about potential risks and benefits of specific pharmacologic treatments. As an example, if a patient without a family history of bipolar disorder clearly has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and possibly has manic symptoms, but has never had a trial of stimulants, the <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio might favor an initial trial of stimulants rather than an antimanic drug. By contrast, if a patient with ADHD symptoms also has recurrent, distinct one- to two-day episodes of elated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, and increased goal-directed activity, along with a family history of mania, and has become agitated and aggressive during trials of two different stimulants, the risk-benefit ratio favors treatment with an antimanic drug.</p><p>The evaluation identifies target symptoms for pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, chronic distractibility and impulsivity in a child with bipolar disorder and comorbid ADHD often do not improve substantially with antimanic drugs; however, euphoria, irritability, grandiosity, and decreased need for sleep should improve. Identifying the target symptoms often requires probing. A patient with episodes of rage may reveal that the episodes stem from an inability to complete homework, which in turn is due to anxiety and poor attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Target symptoms may need to be modified over time as patients undergo developmental changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Pretreatment assessments also address factors that can interfere with pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These include prior nonadherence to medications as well as fears, prejudices, and false beliefs regarding medication on the part of patients and parents. Treatment is unlikely to succeed without the family&rsquo;s cooperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A general medical history and physical examination are also completed as part of the assessment, to rule out general medical illnesses that may account for the psychiatric symptoms and to rule out contraindications for specific medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a> is usually avoided in obese patients, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a> in significant renal or thyroid disease). The history includes cardiac illnesses, endocrine or metabolic problems, gastrointestinal difficulties, and neurologic symptoms, as well as menstrual history in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is useful to ask about recent somatic and cognitive symptoms (eg, headaches, stomach aches, feeling tired, sleep problems, or impaired concentration) to establish a baseline so that these symptoms are not misattributed to new medications. Clinicians should also ask about the patient&rsquo;s ability to swallow pills. Family history of cardiac conduction problems (particularly sudden cardiac death) and endocrine and metabolic illnesses is important.</p><p>In addition, the history should identify current medications that may interact with psychotropic medications. Specific interactions of psychotropic drugs with other medications may be determined using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.</p><p>If many (eg, three or more) months have elapsed since the last examination by the primary care clinician, we suggest referral for a complete physical examination. The prescribing clinician should obtain a baseline blood pressure, pulse, weight, and body mass index (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), because these are monitored during pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H264945265\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.) </p><p>Laboratory tests are performed as indicated by the history and examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tests are also guided by the choice of medication and are used to establish a baseline for potential adverse effects (eg, obtaining a lipid profile and glucose before initiating an antipsychotic or obtaining renal function tests prior to using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A pregnancy test is recommended for all postmenarchal females; a 12-month prospective study of female adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 125) found that pregnancy occurred in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic portion of the assessment for pediatric bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis#H190481581\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a>.) </p><p>Patients with pediatric bipolar disorder may have parents with psychopathology (eg, bipolar or unipolar depressive disorders) that can affect outcome of treatment in the offspring. Affected parents who are not in treatment should be referred for evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66708203\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT AGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More studies of pharmacologic treatment for bipolar disorder have been conducted in adolescents than in younger children. Nevertheless, pharmacotherapy can effectively treat children as well as adolescents.</p><p>Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated that medications (eg, second-generation antipsychotics) are efficacious for mania in patients aged 10 to 17 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. Randomized trials also indicate that preadolescent children with bipolar disorder, as well as adolescents, respond to pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, one trial found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a> was efficacious for treating mania in 279 youth, and that response (symptoms improved much or very much from baseline) appeared to be comparable for children age 6 to 12 years and adolescents age 13 to 15 years (65 and 75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other trials also found that medications can benefit children as young as 6 and 8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>In addition, multiple observational studies suggest that manic children as young as age 4 years can successfully be treated with medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. As an example, a prospective 16-week observational study found that in children with mania who were 4 to 9 years old and treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aripiprazole</a> (n = 96), significant improvement occurred in 63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40437333\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are treated with pharmacotherapy.

Optimally, the child or adolescent should return to their baseline &ldquo;premorbid&rdquo; position on the developmental trajectory, prior to the onset of mood symptoms. In many youth with bipolar disorder, it can be difficult to identify a premorbid baseline, in which case the goal is the best possible functioning achievable with the fewest adverse effects.</p><p>Mania, hypomania, psychosis, and other specified bipolar and related disorder in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are discussed separately.

Severe illness is characterized by psychotic features, suicidal ideation with a plan and intent, or fluid and food refusal that worsens general medical status due to dehydration, weight loss, and malnutrition. ECT is used infrequently for adolescents and rarely for younger children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66708449\"><span class=\"h1\">MONOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although medication combinations are frequently required for children and adolescents with mania, it is generally preferable to initiate pharmacotherapy with monotherapy to facilitate adherence and minimize costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Successfully achieving monotherapy is more likely if one takes a &ldquo;start low, go slow, but keep moving up&rdquo; approach, particularly in outpatient settings. Metabolism and tolerability of antimanic medications vary widely in children, so using low starting doses and cautious titration schedules can reduce the risk of substantial side effects that lead to medication discontinuation. However, the correct dose of medication is the one that provides optimal response with an acceptable level of side effects, so continued titration upward is required if impairing symptoms persist and the drug is tolerated. Undertreatment and premature discontinuation can lead to a potentially efficacious medication being labeled as ineffective. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2779075\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonresponse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications are often not beneficial for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.
