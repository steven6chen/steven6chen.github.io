Formulating a diagnosis and treatment plan is helped by understanding the menstrual cycle and taking an organized approach to patient evaluation.</p><p>This topic will review the basic physiology of menstruation and provide an approach to the adult patient who presents to the ED with vaginal bleeding. Detailed discussions of pediatric patients with vaginal bleeding and of specific causes of genital tract bleeding are found separately.

A basic summary of menstruation follows. A more detailed description of menstruation is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The first half of the menstrual cycle is known as the <strong>follicular phase</strong>. During the follicular phase, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus, which then stimulates the pituitary to release both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In the ovary, under the influence of these two hormones, two things occur: A dominant follicle matures, and increasing levels of estrogen are secreted. Estrogen stimulates the endometrial glands and stroma to grow and proliferate, causing the endometrium to thicken.</p><p>Once estrogen levels reach a threshold level for about 36 hours, a surge in LH occurs, which triggers ovulation and the beginning of the second half of the menstrual cycle known as the <strong>luteal phase.</strong> Under the influence of LH, the ruptured dominant follicle rapidly evolves into the corpus luteum, which secretes increased amounts of progesterone. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum involutes 14 days after ovulation, and progesterone levels fall. The drop in progesterone during the latter part of the luteal phase triggers release of prostaglandins, which cause vasospasm of the arteries feeding the endometrium. This leads to a sloughing of the outer layers of the endometrium (ie, menstruation).</p><p>The median age of menarche is approximately 12.5 years. The mean duration of menstrual bleeding is four days. Bleeding for greater than seven days is considered abnormal. The average blood loss per menstruation is 35 mL; it is considered abnormal to lose greater than 80 mL of blood per menstruation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important elements of the history are listed here and discussed further below: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Description of current bleeding (volume, duration)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal menstrual bleeding pattern</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy possibility and obstetrical history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Sexual/pelvic</span> infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma and sexual assault</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid illnesses and medications (eg, hormone replacement, anticoagulants)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms (eg, pain, urinary abnormalities, vaginal discharge)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other bleeding abnormalities or systemic symptoms</p><p/><p>Begin by asking the patient about the volume and duration of bleeding to help quantify total or ongoing blood loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69390 \">table 1</a>). Useful information includes the number of tampons or pads changed over the last 12 to 24 hours, whether these were saturated, and the presence or absence of clots. Women with heavy bleeding typically need to change <span class=\"nowrap\">pads/tampons</span> a minimum of once every 3 hours. Clots with a diameter greater than 1 inch (2.5 cm) are associated with menstrual blood loss of at least 80 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>In the premenopausal patient, obtain a detailed menstrual history, including: the date of the last period, any change in the frequency of periods, whether flow is typically heavy or prolonged, and whether the patient has had similar episodes of bleeding. Ask whether the bleeding started at the expected onset of a menstrual period, or whether bleeding began prematurely or late. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The possibility of pregnancy must be addressed. Ask if the patient has missed a menstrual period. An obstetrical history should be obtained and includes: the outcome of all prior pregnancies (including miscarriages and procedures for pregnancy termination), pregnancy complications, current or recent methods of contraception, and any pelvic infections or sexually transmitted infections. Recognize that these questions are sensitive, and every attempt should be made to obtain this history from the patient privately (ie, in a room &ndash; not a hallway - without family or friends present).</p><p>Ask about trauma to the genitourinary tract, including sexual assault. The assessment and treatment of sexual assault survivors is reviewed separately. Pregnant patients should be asked about trauma to the abdomen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening#H2207911876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.) </p><p>Ask about systemic disease and obtain a complete list of the patient's current medications. Ask whether the patient takes postmenopausal hormone therapy or has used any assisted reproductive technologies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Bleeding patterns'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ask about associated symptoms. Fever and chills suggest an infectious etiology such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a urinary tract infection (UTI), or pyelonephritis. When urinary symptoms are present, bleeding may be from hemorrhagic cystitis rather than a gynecologic problem. Bleeding associated with vaginal discharge suggests infection, such as PID or vaginosis. Of note, PID is much more likely to present with pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, and possibly fever than with vaginal bleeding. Low, lateral abdominal pain associated with vaginal bleeding suggests pathology in the fallopian tube or ovary, such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Midline crampy abdominal pain often originates from the uterus but may be related to bladder or bowel pathology. Any pain should be characterized, including: onset, provocative or palliative elements, quality, radiation, site, and time course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A history of bleeding from multiple sites including mucous membranes, frequent bruising, prolonged heavy periods, or a family history of a bleeding disorder suggests a coagulation disorder. Coagulopathy should be suspected in a woman with menorrhagia since menarche. Hemostatic abnormalities in women with menorrhagia are common and may include abnormal platelet aggregation, Von Willebrand disease, and single clotting factor deficiencies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-bleeding-diathesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a bleeding diathesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women#H16087727\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Other, apparently unrelated, symptoms may suggest a diagnosis. Obesity, hirsutism, and irregular periods are suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Headache accompanied by visual changes is suggestive of a pituitary tumor. Although thyroid disease does not often cause vaginal bleeding, the presence of weight gain, chronic fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, alopecia, changes in normal menstrual bleeding pattern, or skin changes suggests hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patient age alters the differential diagnosis. The risk of endometrial carcinoma increases substantially in any woman over the age of 45 with excessive genital tract bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bleeding in a child under the age of 9 is uncommon and warrants evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recent significant weight gain or loss, an eating disorder, or major stress may disturb hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination is directed at determining hemodynamic stability, uncovering evidence of significant or ongoing blood loss, and identifying the underlying etiology of genital tract bleeding. Initial vital signs should be noted; orthostatic vital signs may be useful if the patient reports weakness, dizziness, or syncope associated with the bleeding. Keep in mind that young healthy females may manifest near-normal vital signs despite substantial blood loss, but can decompensate rapidly once blood loss becomes substantial. Thus, serial vital signs are important in patients with significant bleeding. Pale skin or conjunctiva suggests anemia. Mucosal hemorrhage, purpura, or petechiae suggests a bleeding disorder. Ecchymosis may stem from recent trauma or coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The abdominal examination focuses on the presence of an abdominal mass, localized abdominal tenderness, or peritoneal signs. Peritoneal signs may be present with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, or a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. For a pregnant patient beyond 20 weeks gestation, uterine tenderness may suggest placental abruption. Loss of the normal uterine contour can occur with uterine rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The pelvic examination is paramount for determining the source and volume of bleeding, and whether it is ongoing. Clinicians should assess for foreign bodies, signs of trauma, products of conception, and vaginal or cervical discharge. Uterine size and surface contour, adnexal mass or tenderness, and cervical motion tenderness should be noted. If the source of bleeding remains unclear, a rectal examination may be necessary to check for hemorrhoids, blood in stool, or other nongynecologic causes of bleeding. A bladder etiology should also be considered, and the absence of vaginal blood on examination despite a vaginal bleeding history should elevate this concern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;, section on 'Pelvic examination'</a>.)</p><p>A manual pelvic examination should <strong>NOT</strong> be performed on pregnant women with vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks gestation until placenta previa has been ruled out definitively by ultrasound examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placenta-previa-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-morbidity-and-mortality\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placenta previa: Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, morbidity and mortality&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A bimanual or speculum examination is <strong>not</strong> typically performed as an initial step in the examination of premenarchal patients with vaginal bleeding unless the bleeding is copious or the cause remains unclear after direct, external inspection. If an internal examination is ultimately required, it typically should be performed under anesthesia or with sedation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of vaginal bleeding in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy tests and pelvic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A qualitative urine pregnancy test (hCG) should be obtained in any woman of childbearing age with vaginal bleeding, except those with a confirmed pregnancy.</p><p>A positive pregnancy test in a patient with vaginal bleeding should be followed by a pelvic ultrasound (US) examination. Using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) can be visualized around the fifth week of pregnancy. A quantitative serum hCG (beta-hCG) should be obtained when an IUP or clear ectopic pregnancy is not visualized on US, known as a pregnancy of unknown location. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Trends in beta-hCG concentrations over time can be useful for distinguishing viable pregnancies from nonviable ones. Both ectopic pregnancy and nonviable intrauterine pregnancy are associated with beta-hCG levels that do not rise appropriately on serial examinations 48 hours apart (approximately double)<em>.</em> Caution should be used when interpreting a single beta-hCG measurement; there is no single beta-hCG level that can exclude an ectopic pregnancy. </p><p>The author recommends obtaining a pelvic US on all patients in early pregnancy presenting with vaginal bleeding regardless of beta-hCG level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks, TVUS is highly sensitive for identifying placenta previa but less sensitive for identifying placental abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-vaginal-bleeding-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with known placenta previa or a low-lying placenta presenting with vaginal bleeding constitute an obstetrical emergency and immediate obstetrical consultation should be obtained. TVUS is not necessary in these patients, though transabdominal US may be useful for fetal assessment. Any US examination performed on a bleeding patient with known placenta previa should be performed at the bedside in the emergency department (ED) where resuscitation can be performed, rather than the radiology suite. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placenta-previa-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placenta previa: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pelvic US is less helpful in the ED evaluation of nonpregnant patients with painless vaginal bleeding as the results rarely change ED management, but US may identify some causes of vaginal bleeding associated with lower abdominal pain, such as ruptured ovarian cyst and ovarian torsion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H993615432\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal heart rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a fetus approaches viability (between 22 to 24 weeks), fetal heart rate (FHR) becomes a key vital sign. Fetal heart rate can be determined using transabdominal Doppler auscultation or bedside US. The normal range for the FHR is 110 to 160 beats per minute. Assessment of the FHR is discussed in detail separately; basic characteristics are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65859 \">table 2</a>).

A complete blood count should be obtained in all women presenting with significant vaginal bleeding. In unstable patients, type and crossmatch should be sent in preparation for blood transfusion. Pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding should have a blood type and Rh checked. If an underlying bleeding disorder or a coagulopathy is suspected, or if the patient takes anticoagulation medications, prothrombin time with international normalized ratio (INR) should be measured, and if appropriate screening tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).</p><p>Vaginal cultures or urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are obtained if infection is a concern. Urinalysis with or without urine culture may be needed for women with urinary symptoms. In unusual circumstances, clinical findings may indicate a need for additional testing for conditions that cause bleeding (eg, liver disease, hypothyroidism, hemophilia, or other coagulopathies). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many causes of genital tract bleeding exist.

For unstable, <strong>nonpregnant</strong> patients with significant ongoing blood loss from the genital tract, high-dose IV estrogen is a first-line treatment. The usual dose for heavy bleeding is 25 mg IV. Estrogen promotes rapid regrowth of endometrium, covering areas that are denuded and bleeding.

Specific balloon devices designed to control postpartum hemorrhage (eg, Bakri Balloon) may be used for acute, profuse uterine bleeding in nonpregnant patients. If such a device is unavailable, a bladder (Foley) catheter may be placed transcervically followed by inflation of the balloon, and this may provide tamponade in unstable <strong>nonpregnant</strong> women until definitive management can be instituted.

For patients with vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks of pregnancy, placenta previa, placental abruption, and trauma (including intimate partner violence) are leading concerns. Painless bleeding should be assumed to be from placenta previa until proven otherwise. Digital pelvic examination is <strong>NOT</strong> performed in cases of possible placenta previa because of the risk of causing severe hemorrhage from separation of the placenta. Instead, a pelvic US should be performed. Placental abruption (abruptio placenta) is usually associated with pain. US is <strong>not</strong> sufficiently sensitive to diagnose placental abruption.

While most patients with vaginal bleeding can be managed as outpatients, disposition depends upon hemodynamic status, the severity of ongoing blood loss, the degree of anemia, and the presence of major comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24398144\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with vaginal bleeding depends upon a number of factors including patient age, pregnancy status, chronicity and severity of bleeding, comorbidities, and medications. A basic understanding of the physiology of menstruation and a systematic approach are important for diagnosis and management. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Basic physiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life-threatening causes of vaginal bleeding include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pregnancy &le;20 weeks gestation</strong> &ndash; Ectopic pregnancy, retained products of conception, complication of pregnancy termination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pregnancy &gt;20 weeks gestation</strong> &ndash; Placental abruption, placenta previa, uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Other genital tract causes</strong> &ndash; Acute severe menorrhagia, genitourinary trauma, uterine arteriovenous malformation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Common non-life-threatening causes of vaginal bleeding include: labor (&quot;bloody show&quot;), spontaneous abortion, ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, gynecologic infection, foreign body, medications, coagulation disorders, and gynecologic cancers. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important factors to consider in the history include patient age, the characteristics of the bleeding (eg, severity, duration, onset), the possibility of pregnancy or trauma, associated symptoms (including bleeding at other sites, pain, fever), any systemic disease, and medications (particularly those affecting coagulation or platelet function). Women with heavy bleeding typically need to change <span class=\"nowrap\">pads/tampons</span> a minimum of once every 3 hours. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination is directed at determining hemodynamic stability, uncovering evidence of significant blood loss, and identifying the underlying etiology of genital tract bleeding. Remember that young healthy females may manifest near-normal vital signs despite substantial blood loss, only to decompensate rapidly once blood loss becomes substantial. The pelvic examination is paramount for determining the source and volume of bleeding, and whether it is ongoing, but a manual examination is <strong>NOT</strong> performed on pregnant women with vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks gestation until placenta previa has been ruled out definitively by ultrasound (US) examination. As a fetus approaches viability (between 22 to 24 weeks), fetal heart rate (FHR) becomes a key vital sign. The normal range for the FHR is 110 to 160 beats per minute. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H993615432\" class=\"local\">'Fetal heart rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a blood sample for type and crossmatch for any woman with severe or symptomatic vaginal bleeding who may require transfusion; for less severe but concerning hemorrhage, a blood type and screen is generally sufficient. A complete blood count should be obtained in all women with significant vaginal bleeding. A qualitative urine pregnancy test (hCG) should be obtained in any woman of childbearing age whose pregnancy status is in doubt. A positive test is followed by a pelvic US examination. Pregnant patients with vaginal bleeding should have a blood type and Rh status checked. Other studies are obtained based upon clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with vaginal bleeding is approached systematically based upon the answers to a few simple questions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the patient hemodynamically unstable?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the patient pregnant? If yes, is it the patient less than 20 weeks gestational age, or later?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If not pregnant, what are the most important diagnoses to consider in this patient's age group?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically unstable patients are resuscitated in standard fashion, including: airway assessment and stabilization as needed, placement of two large bore (14 or 16 gauge) peripheral intravenous catheters, and activation of the hospital's massive transfusion protocol in cases of severe bleeding. Determine pregnancy status immediately. Pregnant patients past 20 weeks gestational age should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position or have their uterus manually displaced to the left during resuscitation. Immediate gynecologic consultation is required for any hemodynamically unstable patient with severe vaginal bleeding. Pregnant patients often require surgery or delivery. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach, initial management, and disposition'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further diagnostic work-up of hemodynamically stable patients is based upon pregnancy status and patient age. The appropriate work-up for the common patient categories are described in the text.
