As an example, a case of rhabdomyolysis secondary to coxsackievirus myositis has been reported in which the patient's serum contained an elevated level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which was capable of inducing skeletal muscle breakdown in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologic processes induced by the viral infection, which could result in muscle damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3949024764\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE VIRAL MYOSITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3246524177\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical spectrum of muscle involvement associated with viral infection ranges from the more commonly experienced benign myalgias to rhabdomyolysis (associated with myoglobinuric renal failure in some cases).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute viral myositis may present with the following signs and symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial viral infection</strong> &ndash; Patients may present with fever, anorexia, and a history of an upper respiratory tract infection. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present. Some patients have a history of physical exertion in addition to viral symptoms prior to the development of muscle signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who go on to develop myositis-associated rhabdomyolysis, viral symptoms may precede the onset by 1 to 14 days. (See <a href=\"#H3426361899\" class=\"local\">'Rhabdomyolysis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myalgias</strong> &ndash; Mild to moderate myalgias and muscle tenderness occur frequently during the early phase of many acute viral infections. The back and legs are most commonly affected. These symptoms are often self-limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who progress to rhabdomyolysis, the distribution of muscle involvement is more diffuse. Both upper and lower extremities, as well as trunk muscles, are involved. Some patients present with abdominal pain due to abdominal muscle involvement. Weakness parallels the severity of muscle involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscle swelling</strong> &ndash; Muscles are tender and, in children, may be boggy or edematous. In severe cases, a compartment syndrome may develop as a result of muscle edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weakness</strong> &ndash; Weakness parallels the severity of muscle involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pigmenturia</strong> &ndash; Dark urine may be reported in patients who develop rhabdomyolysis.

In a retrospective series from a pediatric emergency department, 38 percent of rhabdomyolysis cases were caused by viral myositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The course of acute viral myositis complicated by rhabdomyolysis is highly variable and reflects complications associated with rhabdomyolysis; these include renal failure, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, altered mental status, and, rarely, cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, a clinical diagnosis of acute viral myositis can be made in a patient with a history of a preceding viral infection. Laboratory testing to rule out the presence of rhabdomyolysis should be performed so that patients can be managed accordingly if present. The diagnostic evaluation for rhabdomyolysis should include testing for CK as well as a urinalysis (with dipstick and microscopic evaluation); this is discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis#H25326606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of preceding viral infection is often suggested by the relevant signs and symptoms (fever, malaise, upper respiratory symptoms, rash in some cases). Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis, with or without atypical lymphocytes. In some cases, additional testing of clinical specimens collected based on symptoms (nasopharyngeal swab, serology, stool specimen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebrospinal fluid) may implicate a viral pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/11,13,25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,25,29</a>]. It is not always possible to establish a definitive viral etiology; the likelihood of detection is greatest early in the course of the infection.</p><p>Evidence of a recent viral infection by serologic testing requires a fourfold increase in viral antibody titer between paired acute and convalescent specimens. If the initial titer is negative, a fourfold increase implies a primary infection with the virus. The infection is probably a reactivation if antibodies are present in low titer initially and if there is a significant rise during convalescence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-viral-arthritis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of viral arthritis&quot;, section on 'Serology'</a>.)</p><p>Muscle biopsy is not indicated in the setting of suspected viral myositis since there are no specific diagnostic findings; it may be used to exclude other causes of rhabdomyolysis such as an inherited metabolic myopathy or an inflammatory myopathy. Muscle biopsy may be entirely normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] or may demonstrate varying degrees of necrosis ranging from scattered necrotic muscle fibers to widespread diffuse necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. Nonspecific muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration, diffuse muscle cell vacuolization, and edema may be seen. Even in the presence of extensive necrosis, there is usually scant or no inflammatory cell infiltration. In most of the reports of acute viral myositis, no viral particles have been seen on biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the metabolic myopathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults#H5036844\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;, section on 'Muscle biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2719692836\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC VIRAL MYOSITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infections caused by echovirus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been linked to chronic myositis. Hepatitis C has been reported to be associated with polymyositis and inclusion body myositis in case reports, pathologic studies, and a Japanese case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enterovirus</strong> &ndash; Echovirus (an enterovirus) has been associated with a chronic myopathy in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia that clinically can resemble idiopathic polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Most of the reported cases have occurred in males with X-linked recessive agammaglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-viral-myositis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The muscle disease is usually preceded by viral meningoencephalitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agammaglobulinemia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Agammaglobulinemia&quot;, section on 'Viral, fungal, and parasitic infections'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Echovirus has been cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid, muscle, blood, and urine of these patients. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels may be normal or elevated. Muscle biopsy shows an inflammatory myopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Human immunodeficiency virus</strong> &ndash; Inflammatory myopathy can occur in patients infected with the HIV virus. Like patients with idiopathic muscle inflammation, HIV-infected patients may have progressive proximal muscle weakness involving the shoulder and hip girdles. They may also complain of nonspecific myalgias and abnormal laboratory findings including elevated muscle enzymes (eg, CK, aldolase, and aspartate transaminase) and abnormal electromyography. Muscle disease associated with HIV infection is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults#H23127552\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute viral myositis not associated with rhabdomyolysis typically present with acute myalgias. The differential for diffuse myalgias is broad and includes rheumatic diseases such as polymyalgia rheumatic (PMR), early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory myopathies, drug reactions (eg, secondary to statins), and endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease. The differential diagnosis and distinguishing features of diffuse myalgias are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60716 \">table 1</a>).
