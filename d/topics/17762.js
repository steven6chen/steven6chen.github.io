The antimicrobial agents available for treatment of enterococcal infection are reviewed here, followed by treatment approaches for clinical syndromes caused by enterococci. Other issues related to enterococci are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in enterococci&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: Epidemiology, prevention, and control&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-of-enterococci\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology of enterococci&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infections due to <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> tend to be more virulent than infections due to <em>Enterococcus faecium</em>. In addition, bacteremia due to <em>E. faecalis</em> is more likely to be associated with endocarditis than bacteremia due to <em>E. faecium</em>. Clinical isolates of <em>E. faecalis</em> tend to be considerably more susceptible to beta-lactam agents than clinical isolates of <em>E. faecium</em>. Isolates of <em>E. faecalis</em> are typically susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> but resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinupristin-and-dalfopristin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinupristin-dalfopristin</a>, whereas most <em>E. faecium</em> isolates are resistant to ampicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration &ge;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> but susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to susceptible strains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enterococci are relatively resistant to penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> (compared with most streptococci); even when these cell wall&ndash;active agents inhibit enterococci, they often do not kill them; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> is even less bactericidal. <em>E. faecium</em> clinical isolates are more resistant to penicillin than <em>E. faecalis</em> (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90 percent of strains [MIC<sub>90</sub>] &gt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> versus 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> respectively); MICs of ampicillin are usually 1 dilution lower than those of penicillin. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Piperacillin</a> activity is similar to that of penicillin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> generally is active against penicillin-susceptible <em>E. faecalis</em>. Cell wall&ndash;active agents with limited or no activity against enterococci include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a>, ticarcillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a>, most cephalosporins, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>.</p><p>Enterococci are also relatively impermeable to aminoglycosides, and the serum concentrations of aminoglycosides required for bactericidal activity are much higher than can be achieved safely in humans. However, the simultaneous use of a cell wall&ndash;active agent raises the permeability of the cell so that an intracellular bactericidal aminoglycoside concentration can be achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bactericidal antimicrobial activity is warranted in clinical circumstances of life-threatening infection. (See <a href=\"#H10054949\" class=\"local\">'Approach to specific infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Enterococcal isolates are usually tested for susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, penicillin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>. The presence of beta-lactamase is very rare; it confers resistance to penicillin and ampicillin when large numbers of organisms are present (such as in the setting of a valvular vegetation), even though the organism may test susceptible using standard laboratory inocula. Thus, to rule out this possibility in patients with life-threatening enterococcal infection (such as meningitis or endocarditis), some experts recommend that the isolate be screened for beta-lactamase production with nitrocefin, a chromogenic cephalosporin, even if ampicillin susceptible. There are also rare reports of more highly penicillin- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> imipenem-resistant isolates of <em>E. faecalis</em> with retained ampicillin susceptibility (albeit with higher-than-usual MICs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]; this has been associated with specific amino acid changes in the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP) of <em>E. faecalis.</em></p><p>Traditionally, the standard of care for severe enterococcal infection (such as endocarditis) has been a cell wall&ndash;active agent combined with an aminoglycoside to generate synergistic bactericidal activity. A newer regimen, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, has yielded clinical cure rates equivalent to that of ampicillin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> for <em>E. faecalis</em> endocarditis (albeit not in prospective, randomized, blinded studies); this includes isolates that did not have high-level aminoglycoside resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In general, we favor the latter regimen as it avoids the toxicity of aminoglycosides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>For circumstances in which a regimen of a cell wall&ndash;active agent plus an aminoglycoside is used, the isolate should be tested for high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>. If the organism is reported as susceptible to high levels of an aminoglycoside (&quot;SYN-S&quot; indicates &quot;susceptible to synergism&quot;), then it may be assumed that synergism will be achieved when that aminoglycoside is combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>; an aminoglycoside should never be used alone for treatment of enterococcal infection. Strains that are resistant to high levels of gentamicin are resistant to synergism with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, netilmicin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> (in addition to gentamicin), but some of these strains lack high-level resistance to streptomycin and thus will still demonstrate synergism with that agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10054949\" class=\"local\">'Approach to specific infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Even for strains lacking high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> and particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> should be avoided. All <em>E. faecium</em> are resistant to synergism with tobramycin due to a species-specific aminoglycoside acetyl transferase, and the majority of <em>E. faecium</em> and <em>E. faecalis</em> fail to show synergism with amikacin.</p><p>For circumstances in which a regimen of a cell wall&ndash;active agent plus an aminoglycoside is used, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> or penicillin are the preferred cell wall&ndash;active agents; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> should be substituted only in the setting of high-level beta-lactam resistance or hypersensitivity with an inability to desensitize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Gentamicin is more convenient since determination of serum gentamicin concentrations is more readily available than serum streptomycin levels. As mentioned above, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> are generally avoided, and laboratories do not test these aminoglycosides.</p><p>Antibiotic regimens and doses for susceptible strains are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71921 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to resistant strains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major categories of resistant enterococci include those with high-level penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> resistance, those with high-level aminoglycoside resistance, and those with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">High-level penicillin resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Penicillin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a></span> resistance is usually due to alterations in penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP-5), a low-affinity PBP of <em>E. faecium</em>.

One agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; prior approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinupristin-and-dalfopristin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinupristin-dalfopristin</a> has been removed). The utility of this agent for treatment of endocarditis is uncertain, although there are anecdotal cases suggesting some utility. The resistance profile of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolates should be evaluated carefully in conjunction with infectious diseases expertise when selecting appropriate therapy for such organisms. The approach to treatment of such isolates should be assessed in each individual case. (See <a href=\"#H10054949\" class=\"local\">'Approach to specific infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Vancomycin-resistant <em>E. faecium</em> isolates often have concurrent high-level resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. In contrast, vancomycin-resistant <em>E. faecalis</em> are usually susceptible to beta-lactams, as are <em>E. gallinarum</em> and <em>E. casseliflavus</em> (which are intrinsically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> resistant).

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) generally do not require bactericidal therapy, and urinary catheter-associated bacteriuria often resolves with removal of the catheter. When therapy for enterococcal urinary tract isolates is indicated, monotherapy is sufficient. In the setting of invasive infections such as endocarditis, meningitis, and bacteremia (in the setting of valvulopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> critical illness), bactericidal activity is warranted (although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> has been successful in vancomycin-resistant <em>E. faecium</em> meningitis). In such cases, synergistic activity of a cell wall&ndash;active agent in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>), is generally required (<em>E. faecalis</em>). Testing for high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin should be performed when combination therapy with an aminoglycoside is considered (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Approach to susceptible strains'</a> above).</p><p>In general, determining the clinical significance of an enterococcus recovered from a patient should be tailored to individual patient circumstances, since isolation of an enterococcus does not necessarily require targeted therapy. Enterococci can also be colonizers (such as in respiratory specimens or urinary catheters) or part of a mixed infection (such as in polymicrobial cultures in the setting of intraabdominal surgery or traumatic wounds) for which therapy is being administered for more virulent organisms. <em>E. faecalis</em> infections tend to be more virulent than <em>E. faecium</em> and therefore should command greater attention when the clinical significance of culture data is in question.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the illness, acute infection due to VRE should be treated to resolution, although in some cases colonization may persist indefinitely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10055015\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinary tract is the most common site from which enterococci are recovered; manifestations can include urinary colonization, uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, perinephric abscess, or prostatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Nitrofurantoin achieves excellent therapeutic levels in the urine and renal parenchyma but is not adequate for treatment of pyelonephritis or enterococcal infection at other sites. Fosfomycin has FDA approval for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs caused by <em>E. faecalis</em> (as well as <em>Escherichia coli</em>), although many <em>E. faecium</em> strains are also susceptible to fosfomycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

For circumstances in which an intravascular catheter is the likely source of the bacteremia, catheter removal alone may be sufficient to cure the infection. However, if febrile, most patients should be empirically started on antibiotics after detection of enterococcal infection and after additional cultures are obtained; such therapy can generally be discontinued after five to seven days if symptoms have resolved and no valvular abnormality is found.</p><p>Most cases of enterococcal bacteremia due to species other than <em>E. faecalis</em> are not associated with endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-enterococcal-infections/abstract/14,31,33,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31,33,38-41</a>]. The relative risk of endocarditis in patients with <em>E. faecalis</em> bacteremia is higher but still relatively low. Echocardiography is appropriate in the setting of persistent bacteremia or underlying valvular disease.
