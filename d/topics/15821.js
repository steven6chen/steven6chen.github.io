Because most venomous snakebites occur in developing countries with poorly developed health reporting systems and because many deaths occur before medical care can be provided, these numbers are likely underestimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; literature suggesting that elapids cause neurotoxic effects and vipers cause local and hemorrhagic effects is misleading and inaccurate. A number of Elapid snakes cause predominantly local effects, rather than systemic effects (typically the &quot;spitting&quot; cobras), while others cause predominantly coagulopathic rather than neurotoxic systemic effects (eg, Australian brown snakes). Similarly, some Viperid snakes cause minimal local effects and predominantly systemic effects, including paralysis, coagulopathy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rhabdomyolysis.</p><p>Geographical distribution, physical characteristics, and venom effects by family are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elapidae</strong> &ndash; Elapid snakes are found widely throughout tropical and subtropical regions of Asia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93454 \">table 2</a>), Africa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93455 \">table 1</a>), Central and South America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93457 \">table 3</a>), the Middle East (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93458 \">table 6</a>), and Australia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93456 \">table 4</a>). Common names include cobras (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93566\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93566 \">picture 1</a>), kraits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93580\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93580 \">picture 2</a>), mambas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93581 \">picture 3</a>), coral snakes, Taipans, tiger snakes, copperheads (Australian), death adders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93567\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93567 \">picture 4</a>) (Australia and New Guinea), black snakes (Australia), and brown snakes (Australia). Sea snakes are also Elapid snakes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Physical characteristics that, with some exceptions, distinguish these snakes from members of the Viperidae family include shorter fangs (compared to body size), a less triangular head with a more subtle transition from head to body (but with exceptions, such as Australian death adders), and a larger scale pattern on the head. The way fangs attach to the bone is different in Elapid snakes, compared to Viperid snakes; specifically the fangs have minimal or no capacity to rotate, unlike Viperid snakes, which can rotate the fang, folding it against the roof of the mouth, thus enabling development of significantly longer fangs, compared to body size, than found in Elapid snakes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Envenomation from many but not all of these snakes can frequently cause flaccid paralysis. However, bites from individual species may also cause local tissue toxicity, tissue necrosis, coagulopathy, hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, or acute kidney injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viperidae</strong> &ndash; Viperid snakes have a broad distribution that encompasses many regions that contain elapid snakes but also includes Europe and North America. These snakes are commonly referred to as vipers (eg, Russell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93582 \">picture 5</a>), carpet, saw-scaled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93577\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93577 \">picture 6</a>), or Gaboon pit viper), adders (eg, puff or night adder), asps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93583\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93583 \">picture 7</a>), bushmasters, and pit vipers (eg, rattlesnakes, Central Asian, green tree vipers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93576\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93576 \">picture 8</a>), habus or Malayan pit viper (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93574\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93574 \">picture 9</a>). The tables provide medically important Viperid snakes in Africa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93455 \">table 1</a>), Asia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93454 \">table 2</a>), Central and South America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93457 \">table 3</a>), Australia and the Pacific Islands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93456 \">table 4</a>), Europe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93459 \">table 5</a>), and the Middle East (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93458 \">table 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Snakes belonging to the Viperidae family typically have folding, long fangs, triangular heads with an abrupt transition to the body, and smaller numerous scales on the head. Pit vipers also have heat-sensing pits towards the front of the head (for infra-red &ldquo;vision&rdquo;) and elliptical pupils (for nocturnal species).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Viperid envenomations are frequently associated with local reaction (pain, blistering, bruising, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling), tissue necrosis, coagulopathy, hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute kidney injury, although some Viperids cause minimal local reactions. Some viperid snakebites can also cause paralysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24216746\"><span class=\"h1\">VENOM PROPERTIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Snake venoms have wide variations in composition, potency, and sites of action. A basic understanding of these characteristics helps guide appropriate evaluation and management of snake envenomation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4260873\"><span class=\"h2\">Composition and sites of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Snake venom is a complex mixture of toxins used primarily to immobilize and sometimes initiate digestion of prey and secondarily to ward off predators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>]. Composition of venom varies greatly from one species to another. Within a species the composition can also differ, sometimes according to age of the snake or the geographic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The identified components and physiologic sites of action for snake venom determine the spectrum of clinical features commonly seen after snakebite as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Locally acting toxins</strong> &ndash; These toxins predominantly consist of enzymes which cause tissue destruction through diverse mechanisms (eg, phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> [PLA<sub>2</sub>], phosphodiesterases, hyaluronidases, peptidases, metalloproteinases).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Swelling, blistering, ecchymosis, tissue necrosis, and pain indicate the presence of these proteolytic enzymes in the venom and are commonly seen after snakebites by many, but not all Viperid snakes. Local effects are minimal or absent after bites of many elapid snakes (eg, kraits, some mambas, or death adder). However, other elapid snakes can cause serious tissue necrosis (eg, some African and Asian cobras).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemically acting toxins</strong> &ndash; Systemic toxins may target a wide variety of tissues including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Neurotoxins</strong> &ndash; Neurotoxins generally target the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) presynaptically, postsynaptically, or at both sites and affect skeletal muscle. The site of venom action has significant consequences for the ability to treat the resulting paralysis as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Presynaptic</strong> &ndash; Presynaptic neurotoxins are generally based on PLA<sub>2</sub> and damage the terminal axon at the NMJ, through entry into the cell. This type of paralysis is not reversible with antivenom or anticholinesterase and may take days to weeks for recovery of function. Examples of snakes with venom active at the presynaptic NMJ include kraits and many Australian snakes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Postsynaptic</strong> &ndash; Postsynaptic neurotoxins are generally long or short chain peptides which target the acetylcholine receptor on the muscle endplate, blocking response to acetylcholine, external to the cell. This type of paralysis can sometimes be fully reversed with antivenom, or the neuromuscular block overcome with anticholinesterases (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Other types of snake neurotoxins (eg, dendrotoxins and fasciculins in African mamba venoms) are less common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Myotoxins</strong> &ndash; Snake venom myotoxins may act either systemically or locally. Chemically, they are primarily based upon PLA<sub>2</sub> and generally target skeletal rather than smooth muscle. Rhabdomyolysis may occur from enzymatic tissue damage adjacent to the bite wound and, or by actions of systemic venom myotoxins on skeletal muscle (notably some Australian snakes, sea snakes, some kraits, South American rattlesnakes, Sri Lankan Russell&rsquo;s viper). Secondary hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury can occur if muscle damage is extensive and may lead to secondary cardiotoxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Systemic hemostasis toxins</strong> &ndash; These common snake venom toxins represent a vast array of molecular types, mechanisms and targets. The common theme is interference with blood clotting, usually by increasing bleeding tendency, with resulting consumptive coagulopathy and hemorrhage. The coagulopathy can usually be reversed by timely administration of antivenom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Less commonly, clotting and thrombosis may be promoted (eg, Martinique viper venom) and cause deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, and cerebral infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">There are also toxins within this broad group that damage blood vessels, often a synergistic action which, combined with other toxins reducing clotting function, can cause significant hemorrhagic disease. Targets within the coagulation cascade include factor X, IX, and V activators; procoagulants that activate factor II (prothrombin); and direct and indirect fibrinogenolytics or fibrinogenases. There are also toxins causing direct inhibition of parts of the coagulation system (anticoagulants), and toxins either inhibiting or stimulating platelet activation directly or through action on elements, such as Von Willebrand factor. The hemorrhagins target blood vessel walls and are predominantly zinc metalloproteinases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cardiotoxins</strong> &ndash; Most cardiotoxic effects of snake venoms are secondary to hemorrhage or hypovolemia. Less commonly, hypotension can arise from direct actions of venom components, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and natriuretic peptides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Kidney </strong>&ndash; Acute kidney injury may occur from the direct action of some venoms (especially some populations of Russell&rsquo;s viper) and frequently accompanies hypotension, coagulopathy or rhabdomyolysis as a secondary effect of envenoming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Other toxins</strong> &ndash; Venoms also may contain a wide array of other, mostly minor toxins, such as histamine, serotonin, and L-amino oxidase.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4260900\"><span class=\"h2\">Potency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of methods to determine venom potency have been developed using in vivo and in vitro methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Median lethal dose in a live mouse (LD50) is a commonly used measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Based upon this approach, several types of elapid venoms appear to be most potent. However, the clinical severity of a bite depends upon several factors other than venom potency such as the amount of venom injected and the site of the bite (eg, extremity, trunk, or head).</p><p>In addition, many factors can influence LD50 measurements, including how the venom is collected, stored, reconstituted and injected. Thus, conflicting results appear in the literature, with major differences between research groups. Venom potency (LD50) should be placed in a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; perspective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As an example, the saw scaled viper (<em>Echis</em> species) has venom which ranks well down the list in potency. However, because of the coagulopathy that this venom creates in humans and poor access to quality health care that at-risk populations for this envenomation endure, more snakebite mortality and morbidity are anecdotally attributed to <em>Echis</em> species than any other group of snakes. </p><p>By contrast, the snake with arguably the most potent venom, the inland taipan (<em>Oxyuranus microlepidotus</em>), has not been recorded as causing any human fatalities, because it is rarely encountered and bites generally occur in keepers with ready access to high quality and effective care, including antivenom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1544315\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1544323\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a snakebite is reported or suspected, key information to determine includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where and when the bite occurred</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A description of the snake</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How the bite occurred and whether there was more than one bite</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any signs or symptoms and the timing of onset</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment and first aid that was provided, including timing of first aid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any recent ethanol or recreational drug use that may modify the patient's presentation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pertinent past medical history, such as current medications (especially anticoagulants or beta blockers), any prior snakebites for which antivenom was given, or allergy to animals used in antivenom production (eg, horses, sheep, rabbits)</p><p/><p>In many cases, the bite is immediately felt and the snake readily identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, some snakes, especially elapids, cause limited to no local pain or tissue necrosis when injecting venom. Patients bitten in this way may present with paralysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coagulopathy as the first sign of envenomation. This scenario is common for snakebites by nocturnal species (eg, kraits) which frequently happen to people sleeping on the ground in rural tropical areas. Subsequently, victims may develop progressive paralysis without any history of snake bite.</p><p>Similarly, victims of highly toxic snakes, especially children, may present with cardiovascular collapse or seizures without any reported snakebite.</p><p>Symptoms of snakebite can be nonspecific and frequently may be difficult to differentiate from manifestations of anxiety and emotional disturbance caused by the bite. However, findings such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache may be the first symptoms of systemic envenomation and warrant close assessment for the other clinical syndromes associated with snake envenomation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Syncope, diarrhea, and, especially in children, seizures may also occur, but less commonly.</p><p>Symptoms also vary according to the venom characteristics of the biting snake. For example, victims bitten by neurotoxic snakes may report weakness, paralysis, diplopia, or difficulty speaking or swallowing. In addition to local pain and swelling, patients with systemic envenomation by some viper species (eg, North American rattlesnake) may describe a metallic taste in their mouth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-crotalinae-rattlesnake-water-moccasin-cottonmouth-or-copperhead-bites-in-the-united-states#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of Crotalinae (rattlesnake, water moccasin [cottonmouth], or copperhead) bites in the United States&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1544331\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical findings of snakebite vary significantly by species and often evolve over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 7</a>). Frequent, repeated examinations are important to ensure detection of all signs of snake envenomation and to identify serious local or systemic effects. All patients with a potentially toxic snakebite warrant frequent measurement of vital signs and, if available, continuous cardio-respiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring. For many species additional monitoring should be performed based upon expected toxicity and may include checking for ptosis and partial ophthalmoplegia (neurotoxic snakes) or persistent oozing from any wounds or gums (venom-induced coagulopathy).

In some species (eg, Australian tiger snake [<em>Notechis scutatus</em>]) the coagulopathy develops very rapidly but reverses spontaneously around 12 to 15 hours after the bite, even without antivenom. In other species (eg, Malayan pit viper [<em>Calloselasma rhodostoma</em>]) the coagulopathy may continue for up to two weeks, unless reversed with antivenom. The combination of coagulopathic venom toxins plus hemorrhagins can cause rapid and severe effects as seen in victims of saw scaled viper (<em>Echis</em> spp) bites.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22467193\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic testing is based upon clinical findings and targeted towards the expected spectrum of toxicity from snakebites within the specific region.

On the other hand, the 20WBCT had a specificity of 100 percent in this study. Thus, a positive 20WBCT is a reasonable indication for antivenom administration, but a negative 20WBCT does <strong>not</strong> mean that antivenom should be withheld, especially if other clinical findings of coagulopathy (eg, blood oozing at puncture sites, bleeding gums, or epistaxis) are present. Furthermore, if more formal coagulation tests are available, they should be used in preference to the 20WBCT.</p><p>Point of care (POC) coagulation tests may also give erroneous results in some forms of snakebite coagulopathy and generally should <strong>not</strong> be relied upon to make decisions regarding antivenom administration. As an example, in an observational study of 15 Australian patients with snakebite that compared POC INR with conventional coagulation studies, measurement of INR by a POC device gave a false negative result in three of seven patients with venom-induced coagulopathy and one patient with anticoagulant induced coagulopathy and a false positive result in one of seven patients without coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2374816\"><span class=\"h3\">Rhabdomyolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies helpful in identifying rhabdomyolysis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid urine dipstick for blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine for myoglobin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic urinalysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum creatine kinase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>12-lead electrocardiogram</p><p/><p>Venom-induced myolysis causing massive rises in CK levels and myoglobinuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93585\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93585 \">picture 14</a>) is indicative of systemic poisoning. Furthermore, secondary renal damage, although uncommon, remains a risk in these patients. Muscle breakdown when associated with renal failure may cause a marked and rapid increase in serum potassium with resulting cardiac arrhythmias.

In addition, some Australian snakes, such as death adders, brown snakes, and copperheads, though possessing presynaptic neurotoxins, may in some cases show predominantly postsynaptic paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-30</a>]. When associated with significant improvement, anticholinesterases can also provide treatment for paralysis when administration of antivenom is delayed or antivenom is in low supply or not available. Thus, the utility of administration of anticholinesterases depends upon a knowledge of the commonly occurring snakes in the region, the severity of envenomation and paralysis, and availability of supportive treatment. It is not without risk and should be performed with appropriate medical supervision.

Results need to be interpreted based upon the clinical setting. A positive result confirms the snakebite and identifies the most appropriate antivenom to be used but is <strong>not</strong>, by itself, an indication for antivenom administration in otherwise asymptomatic patients. The assay is highly dependent upon the specimen and how it was obtained and can have low sensitivity. Thus, a negative assay does <strong>not </strong>rule out snakebite.</p><p>In patients with systemic envenoming, where antivenom is indicated, it is advisable to compare the venom detection result with a venom immunotype determined by diagnostic algorithms for Australian snakes; if the two routes provide a similar answer, an appropriate specific antivenom can be used with confidence, but if each route gives a different answer, expert advice should be sought from a clinical toxinologist, or if that will entail an unacceptable delay in treatment, polyvalent antivenom should be used.</p><p>When performing the test, carefully read the manufacturer's instructions. A description of the test procedure is available at <a href=\"http://www.toxinology.com/generic_static_files/cslavh_svdk.html&amp;token=6jrC5IFTDW+oFctvJFtWJGa/5Wjn7F2OwAONKKSoTikZBv9ncHn5b7n0HrINxmix4fQD4M6cX0EYF4pM62JRIYuqDhNkWQ1B8EQv0DUhMN0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6594\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.toxinology.com/generic_static_files/cslavh_svdk.html</a>. Although the manufacturer provides instructions for testing of blood, the results are typically unreliable and, whenever possible, swabs from the bite site or urine should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Technique for blood testing differs from what is recommended for urine or swabs from the bite site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10687722\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients, diagnosis of snakebite is straightforward because the bite is immediately felt and a snake is seen, but often a snake is not reliably witnessed and at least for some snake species, the act of biting may cause minor effects to the human victim and may go unnoticed. However, depending upon the region, snakebite should remain in the differential diagnosis of abrupt onset of paralysis, coagulopathy, myolysis, renal failure, collapse, and, especially in children, seizures, syncope, or cardiovascular collapse.</p><p>The effects of snake venom can be divided into distinct syndromes, which may vary in severity depending upon the species of snake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93455 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93454 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93457 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93456 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93459 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93458\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93458 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The evaluation of the patient should take into account each syndrome. In particular, the presence of coagulopathy may occasionally be useful in the clinical diagnosis of snake bite. As an example, in Papua New Guinea, envenomation from the death adder rarely causes a significant coagulopathy in contrast to taipan snakebites. In some regions, such as Sri Lanka and Australia, there are diagnostic algorithms which may assist in determining the most likely type of snake in patients based upon local and systemic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93179\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93179 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93180%7EEM%2F93181\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93180 graphicRef93181 \">algorithm 2A-B</a>).</p><p>Severe envenomation is suggested by one or more of the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/snakebites-worldwide-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmation of a bite from a dangerous snake (digital photograph or verified snake specimen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly progressive swelling from the bite site</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid development of local blistering or bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent oozing of blood from bite marks and other wounds (including venipunctures), suggesting coagulopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlarged, painful lymph nodes draining the region of the bite </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of systemic envenomation, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea (but be cautious as these may result from an anxiety reaction)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe headache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lethargy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle weakness marked by ptosis or &quot;heavy&quot; eyelids, ophthalmoplegia, difficulty with speech, swallowing, drooling, limb weakness, or respiratory difficulty</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle fasciculation (especially for mamba bites)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Epistaxis, bleeding from the gums, hematemesis, hematochezia, or hematuria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sudden collapse with shock</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Brown or black urine indicating hematuria or myoglobinuria</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61373588\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many patients the diagnosis of snakebite is obvious based upon clinical findings. However, sudden collapse, seizure, syncope, unexplained <span class=\"nowrap\">coagulopathy/bleeding,</span> developing descending flaccid paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, or renal failure should raise the possibility of snakebite within a wider set of differential diagnoses. In addition, a patient stating that they have suffered a snakebite may potentially present with clinical features that could have other etiologies that might become apparent by detailed history taking.</p><p>The differential diagnosis varies according to the primary clinical features snakebite victims might develop as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paralysis</strong> &ndash; Toxic encounters in addition to snake bite that may cause flaccid paralysis include paralytic tick envenomation, paralytic shellfish poisoning, nicotine poisoning (ingestion or dermal exposure), botulism, or rarely, envenomation by a blue-ringed octopus or cone snail. Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome also is an acquired form of paralysis to consider. Differentiating features include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bites by neurotoxic snakes (eg, most Australian dangerous elapid snakes, coral snakes, kraits, many cobras (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93566\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93566 \">picture 1</a>), king cobra, many sea snakes, selected rattlesnakes (particularly Latin American species), western races of Russell&rsquo;s viper, some European viper species) are associated with descending paralysis while tick paralysis or paralysis caused by Guillain-Barr&eacute; typically is ascending.

Envenomation occurs when these unusual animals are handled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The approach to muscle weakness caused by other medical illness is described separately.

The causes of rhabdomyolysis can be broadly divided into three categories: traumatic or muscle compression (eg, crush syndrome or prolonged immobilization), nontraumatic exertional (eg, marked exercise, hyperthermia, or metabolic myopathies), and nontraumatic nonexertional (eg, drugs or toxins, such as snake venoms, infections, or electrolyte disorders). In most instances, rhabdomyolysis caused by snake bite is associated with pain and local swelling and thus is readily distinguished from other causes. The causes of rhabdomyolysis and its diagnosis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> &ndash; Consumptive coagulopathy with bleeding is a common feature of bites by many snake species and, given the effect of snake venoms on multiple pathways, is characterized by prolongation of both prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) in association with decreased fibrinogen. Such primary consumptive coagulopathy is not generally a feature of other types of envenoming, except for South American <em>Lonomia</em> caterpillars, skin contact with which can cause a profound and potentially fatal coagulopathy similar to snakebite. A number of other types of envenoming can cause major systemic illness, with intravascular hemolysis, multi-organ failure and secondary DIC, in some ways similar to sepsis, but rather distinct from the primary coagulopathy caused by some snakes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sepsis, multiple trauma, obstetrical complications, or malignancy may present with similar hematologic features as snake envenomation but are readily distinguished by clinical findings (eg, the presence of fever and signs of infection [eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> petechiae] in patients with sepsis, evidence of multiple trauma, or known or suspected malignancy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bleeding may also be caused by a wide array of other disease states, including hereditary abnormalities of the hemostasis system (such as hemophilia or Von Willebrand disease). Of note, mild variants of such congenital abnormalities are an important underlying cause for unexplained, but minor changes in coagulation tests in a snakebite patient who otherwise shows no evidence of significant envenoming. In many instances, a careful history and physical examination and more rigorous laboratory testing can define the underlying cause.

(See <a href=\"#H4260873\" class=\"local\">'Composition and sites of action'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1544315\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical findings of snakebite vary significantly by species and often evolve over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959 \">table 7</a>). Frequent, repeated examinations are important to ensure detection of all signs of snake envenomation and to identify serious local or systemic effects. All patients with a potentially toxic snakebite warrant frequent measurement of vital signs and, if available, continuous cardio-respiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring. For many species additional monitoring may include checking for ptosis, partial ophthalmoplegia, or persistent oozing from any wounds or gums. A fluid balance chart should also be maintained. (See <a href=\"#H1544331\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When assessing for coagulopathy in snakebite victims, traditional coagulation studies (ie, D-dimer or fibrin degradation products, complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio) are preferred to the whole blood clotting test whenever possible. Point of care coagulation tests should <strong>not</strong> be used. (See <a href=\"#H2374800\" class=\"local\">'Coagulopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of anticholinesterases (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a>) as part of a Tensilon test can identify whether paralysis is due to snakes with purely or predominantly post-synaptic venom effects. When associated with significant improvement, anticholinesterases can also provide treatment for paralysis when administration of antivenom is delayed or antivenom is in low supply or not available. Precautions and dosing of anticholinesterases for an edrophonium (Tensilon) or neostigmine test are provided.

However, often a snake is not reliably witnessed and at least for some snake species, the act of biting may cause minor effects to the human victim and may go unnoticed. Thus, depending upon the region, snakebite should remain in the differential diagnosis of abrupt onset of paralysis, coagulopathy, myolysis, renal failure, collapse, and, especially in children, seizures, syncope, or cardiovascular collapse.
