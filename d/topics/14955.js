It codes for a homodimeric transmembrane protein (mol wt 94 kDa) that is found on most cells, but most densely on erythroid precursors and placental cells. There is a binding site for the transcription factor Stat5 in the first intron of the TfR gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Expression of constitutively active Stat5A in an erythroid cell line increased TfR levels, while lethally irradiated mice that received a transplant of <span class=\"nowrap\">Stat5a/b</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(-/-)</span> liver cells developed microcytic, hypochromic anemia.</p><p>Each TfR molecule can bind two diferric Tf molecules (four Fe3+ atoms), which it endocytoses after clustering on clathrin coated pits. The iron is off loaded in acidified vacuoles and the apotransferrin-TfR complex is recycled to the cell surface where apo-Tf is discharged and released back into the circulation. TfR mRNA has five 3' IREs and, as it occurs in other iron genes, is post-transcriptionally regulated by IRPs, being stabilized in iron deficiency and degraded in iron overload. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Systemic iron homeostasis'</a> below.)</p><p>Inactivation of TfR in mice is embryonically lethal due to severe anemia and abnormal central nervous system development. Haploinsufficiency of TfR causes microcytosis and a reduction of total body iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Conditional heart inactivation of TfR causes cardiomegaly, decreased cardiac function, failure of mitochondrial respiration, and early death of mutant mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Conditional inactivation of TfR in the epithelial cells of the intestine causes disruption of the epithelial barrier and early death of mice. Since the phenotype was unresponsive to parenteral iron treatment, the authors suggested that TfR is implicated in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The only disease associate with TfR mutations does not cause anemia but a type of combined immunodeficiency. It is due to a homozygous mutation that disrupts the TfR internalization signal, strongly impairing endocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Serum (soluble) TfR (sTfR) is a product of membrane TfR, which is released into the circulation by membrane proteases when TfR is not associated with its ligand, diferric transferrin, as occurs in iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Levels of sTfR measured in sera correlate directly with erythropoietic expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H685978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Soluble transferrin receptor'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ferritin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ferritin is the cellular storage protein for iron. It is a huge (mol wt 440 kDa), 24 subunit protein consisting of light (L ferritin, 20 kd, gene on chromosome 19) and heavy chains (H ferritin, 21 kd, gene on chromosome 11) which can store up to 4500 atoms of iron within its spherical cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. H Ferritin possesses ferroxidase activity necessary for iron uptake by the ferritin molecule. An RNA binding protein (poly (rC)-binding protein 1, PCBP1) appears to be required as a cytosolic chaperone to deliver iron to ferritin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. PCBP1 gene deletion in mice causes microcytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Ferritin synthesis is subject to at least two levels of control, including DNA transcription via its promoter and mRNA translation via interactions with iron regulatory proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Iron regulatory proteins and iron-responsive element binding protein'</a> below.)</p><p>Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and, along with transferrin and the transferrin receptor, is a member of the protein family that orchestrates cellular defense against oxidative stress and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mice lacking H ferritin die early in gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Mice heterozygous for H ferritin have slightly elevated tissue L ferritin and 7- to 10-fold more serum L ferritin than normal mice, although they do not have tissue iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These observations suggest that reduced H ferritin expression in man might be responsible for cases in which high serum ferritin is present in the absence of iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Conditional inactivation of H ferritin in duodenal cells in mice causes iron overload, indicating that ferritin in the gut is important in the control of iron absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Much of the iron stored in ferritin is accessible for metabolic needs. Ferritin is degraded through a process called ferritinophagy that requires the cargo protein NCOA4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Deficiency of NCOA4 in mice causes increased ferritin aggregates in spleen and liver macrophages and other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>]. In vitro downregulation of NCOA4 affects erythroid maturation and hemoglobin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Ferritin within erythroid precursors may be of special importance in the donation of iron for heme synthesis, especially at the beginning of hemoglobin accumulation, at a time when the transferrin-transferrin receptor pathway is still insufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. When ferritin accumulates, it aggregates and is proteolyzed by lysosomal enzymes; it is then converted to an iron-rich, poorly characterized hemosiderin which releases its iron slowly and is detected in cells by the Prussian blue reaction.</p><p>Ferritin measured clinically in plasma is usually apoferritin, a non-iron containing molecule. The plasma level generally reflects overall iron storage, with 1 ng of ferritin per mL indicating approximately 10 mg of total iron stores. Thus,</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal adult male with a plasma ferritin level of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> has iron stores of approximately 500 to 1000 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum ferritin less than 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is 99 percent specific for making a diagnosis of iron deficiency.

This subject is discussed in depth separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Other gene defects leading to iron overload or high ferritin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ferritin levels may be extremely high in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or certain rheumatologic disorders. In such cases, the ferritin tends to be less glycosylated than normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>A separate ferritin (m-ferritin) is present within mitochondria and is the product of an intronless nuclear gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Its expression is increased in tissues with high numbers of mitochondria, rather than in tissues involved in iron storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. M-ferritin likely protects mitochondria from oxidative damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron regulatory proteins and iron-responsive element binding protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expression of proteins involved in cellular iron uptake and storage is regulated by the iron status of the cell. Iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) are cytosolic RNA-binding proteins that bind to iron-responsive elements (IRE), consisting of a loop configuration of nucleotides, that are located in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of specific mRNAs encoding for iron genes (eg, ferritin, TfR, DMT1, ferroportin and the erythroid specific form of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase [eALAS]).</p><p>Binding of IRPs to their target sequences occurs when the cell is iron deficient and has different effects according to whether the IRE position is at the 5' or the 3' UTR, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When IRPs bind to the 5' IRE of ferritin, ferroportin, or eALAS, the rates of biosynthesis are decreased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When IRPs bind to the 3' end of transcripts such as TfR or DMT1, the mRNA half-life is prolonged and rates of biosynthesis are increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56268 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>IRP1 and IRP2 sense the state of the iron balance in the cell in different ways. When cellular iron levels increase, assembly with iron sulfur clusters changes IRP1 to aconitase and its binding ability is lost. Under the same conditions of cellular iron increase, IRP2 interacts with the iron stabilized FBXL5 protein, which recruits an E3 ligase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>] addressing IRP2 to ubiquitination and proteasome degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. FBXL5 has an iron- and oxygen-sensing domain representing an example of iron-oxygen connection.</p><p>The net effect is that the iron overloaded state is characterized by increased production of ferritin (to permit adequate storage) and decreased production of TfR (to minimize iron uptake). These changes are reversed in iron deficiency, which is characterized by reduced ferritin and elevated TfR synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56268 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Targeted deletion of the gene encoding IRP1 in the mouse leads to no evident hematologic change in adulthood, while targeted deletion of the gene encoding IRP2 causes misregulation of iron metabolism, refractory microcytic anemia, and a neurodegenerative disease due to abnormal neuronal accumulation of iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. These observations establish a major role for IRP2 in the regulation of iron uptake in erythroid cells. However, it has been shown that HIF-2 alpha, which has a 5' UTR IRE, is specifically controlled by IRP1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Irp1-/-</span> mice, when young or iron deficient, develop polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and sudden death from hemorrhages, due to inability to suppress the synthesis of HIF-2 alpha that stimulates both erythropoietin in the kidney and endothelin 1 in pulmonary endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. There are differences in tissue-specific expression of the two IRPs, and also specific targets.

Mutations in the HFE gene are responsible for the vast majority of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis; iron overload is also noted in mice with HFE gene deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Conditional deletion of HFE in the liver produces the phenotype of hemochromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], whereas conditional deletion in duodenal cells or macrophages does not alter systemic iron metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The HFE protein is associated in a complex with TfR. The role of the HFE protein in this complex is unclear, but diferric transferrin competes with this binding. In addition, the function of the HFE-TfR complex is linked to the response of hepcidin to iron availability in some, as yet incompletely understood, manner, since patients with hemochromatosis due to an HFE mutation have low hepcidin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>] and do not respond to oral iron challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

However, this finding has been disputed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Indeed, the diseases caused by mutations of HFE and TfR2 genes are different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Simultaneous gene deletion of both HFE and TfR2 in mice results in marked dysregulation of hepcidin and more severe iron overload than loss of the single molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

This condition is discussed in detail separately.

It exists in the following forms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin in circulating red cells and developing erythroblasts &ndash; approximately 2.5 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron-containing proteins (eg, myoglobin, cytochromes, catalase) &ndash; 400 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma transferrin-bound iron &ndash; 3 to 7 mg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remainder is storage iron in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin</p><p/><p>Adult men have approximately 1 g of storage iron (mostly in liver, spleen, and bone marrow). Adult women have less storage iron depending upon the extent of menses, pregnancies, deliveries, lactation, and iron intake. Only a small amount of iron enters and leaves the body on a daily basis. Most iron is recycled from the breakdown of old red blood cells by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Essentially all circulating iron is bound to transferrin. This chelation renders the iron soluble and prevents iron-mediated free radical toxicity. Iron homeostasis is regulated strictly at the level of intestinal absorption and release of iron from macrophages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal iron absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gastrointestinal mucosa plays a major role in regulating iron absorption, which varies according to the form of iron in the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A Western daily diet contains approximately 15 mg of iron. Some of this is heme iron, of which approximately 30 percent is promptly absorbed, likely via its own transport system. A candidate heme iron transporter, named heme carrier protein 1, has been found in the apical brush border membrane of duodenal enterocytes in the mouse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>].</p><p>The remaining iron, accounting for almost all of the iron in the diet in non-Western countries, is poorly absorbed, with less than 10 percent being taken into the mucosal cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71736\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71736 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Heme dietary sources (fish, poultry, and meat) have a higher bioavailability than do non-heme (vegetable) sources (30 versus 10 percent). In addition, intraluminal factors can affect absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64874 \">table 1</a>). Ascorbic acid and meat sources enhance the absorption of non-animal sources of iron such as cereal, breads, fruits, and vegetables, whereas tannates (teas), bran foods rich in phosphates, and phytates inhibit iron absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/165-170\" class=\"abstract_t\">165-170</a>].</p><p>Molecular mechanisms of intestinal heme absorption are unclear. The proposed heme carrier protein 1, which is highly expressed in the gut and stimulated by hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>], functions as a folate transporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>]. A heme exporter, Feline Leukemia Virus Receptor 5 (FLVR5) is expressed in enterocytes, macrophages and erythroblasts with the likely function of exporting heme excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Heme exporter'</a> above.)</p><p>Iron in food is prominently ferric (Fe3+), which is poorly soluble above a pH of 3 and is therefore poorly absorbed. In comparison, ferrous iron (Fe2+) is more soluble, even at the pH of seven to eight seen in the duodenum. As a result, it is more easily absorbed.</p><p>Ferrous iron is taken up at the mucosal side by the intestinal transporter, DMT1. Transcription of both DMT1 and Dcytb is stimulated by hypoxia inducible factor-2 (HIF-2&alpha;) in the hypoxic environment of intestinal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/71,172\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,172</a>]. In this process, Dcytb provides reduction of ferric to ferrous iron. The iron is thought to enter the cell where it binds to cytosolic low molecular weight iron carriers and is transported to the basolateral portion of the cell. To enter the circulation, iron must be transported across the basolateral membrane by the duodenal iron exporter, ferroportin. Upon its release, the ferrous iron is oxidized to the ferric form, and loaded onto transferrin. This oxidation process involves hephaestin, a homologue of ceruloplasmin, a known ferroxidase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucosal cells, in addition to the cellular mechanisms noted above, respond to specific physiologic signals (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hepcidin'</a> above) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54929\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54929 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105245\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105245 \">figure 1</a>). The rate of iron absorption is appropriately enhanced when iron stores are reduced or absent. The degree of erythropoiesis also has an effect, as iron absorption is increased when there is increased erythropoiesis.</p><p>In hypoxia, hepcidin is downregulated to allow increased iron export through ferroportin, while hypoxia inducible factor-2 (HIF-2&alpha;) increases the expression of key genes that contribute to iron absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. Suppression of hepcidin in hypoxia has been proposed to be mediated by HIF-1 alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>] but occurs indirectly through erythropoietic expansion. Candidate proteins for hepcidin suppression in erythropoiesis expansion are cytokines produced by the erythroblasts. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is especially increased in serum of patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia, was first proposed as a major hepcidin inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>]. However, mice with GDF15 gene deletion who are treated with phlebotomy are able to suppress hepcidin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>]. Erythroferrone (erfe), a member of the TNF-alpha family that is strikingly increased in erythroblasts of mice a few hours after phlebotomy or erythropoietin administration, has been shown to play a major role in hepcidin inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. However, erfe does not inhibit hepcidin when the BMP pathway is overactive, as in mice lacking Tmprss6, strengthening the complex process of hepcidin inhibitory control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].</p><p>Iron absorption is especially increased in disorders that cause ineffective erythropoiesis, such as beta thalassemia, dyserythropoietic and sideroblastic anemia, or variants of the myelodysplastic syndrome. On the other hand, intestinal cells can hold onto iron in the iron-replete state; this iron is lost when the mucosal cells are sloughed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. All of these regulatory processes are mainly mediated by hepcidin through its interaction with ferroportin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This function of hepcidin appears to be especially important when there are competing needs for iron, such as when anemia, iron deficiency, and infection coexist, as shown in African children in the malaria setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>].</p><p>Iron absorption is decreased in conditions of iron excess through hepcidin increase, a process lost in hereditary hemochromatosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no normal mechanism of regulated iron loss. Iron is lost in sweat, shed skin cells, and perhaps some gastrointestinal loss at a rate of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. A normal adult Western male has 1 to 2 mg of heme iron and 10 to 15 mg of other iron in his diet. If 30 percent of the heme iron and 10 percent of the other iron is absorbed, then the total rate of iron absorption is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, a man can easily stay in iron balance and even build up iron stores. On the other hand, a woman with an additional menstrual iron loss of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> generally has lower iron stores than men, and is always delicately poised to become iron deficient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76998 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>There is abundant expression of DMT1 in the proximal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. This raises the possibility that there is an iron excretory pathway that is overcome by constitutive reabsorption. If this hypothesis is correct, pharmacologic blockade of this pathway could represent an important therapeutic maneuver for syndromes of iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron release from macrophages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 to 25 mg of iron are released daily from the breakdown of senescent red cells in the macrophages. Hemoglobin heme released from phagocytosed red cells is catabolized by microsomal heme oxygenase to biliverdin and carbon monoxide and the resulting iron is released to the circulation through ferroportin or stored in ferritin according to the body needs and to the local concentration of hepcidin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/179\" class=\"abstract_t\">179</a>]. Thus, hepcidin coordinates both duodenal iron absorption as well as macrophage iron release. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hepcidin'</a> above.)</p><p>Upon its release from ferroportin, ferrous iron is oxidized to the ferric form, and loaded onto transferrin. The oxidation process involves ceruloplasmin, a known copper dependent multioxidase. This could explain the iron overload that is seen in aceruloplasminemia, an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterized by anemia, diabetes, retinal degeneration, and neurologic symptoms. Affected patients evidence inherited mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene, along with marked parenchymal iron accumulation in conjunction with an absence of circulating serum ceruloplasmin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-iron-balance/abstract/180\" class=\"abstract_t\">180</a>].
