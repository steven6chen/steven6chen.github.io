The pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is not fully understood. Nevertheless, a number of conditions are known to induce this disorder with varying degrees of certainty, with gallstones and chronic alcohol abuse accounting for two-thirds or more cases in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78423 \">table 1</a>). This list will undoubtedly continue to grow, and the number of cases diagnosed as &quot;idiopathic&quot; will decrease as our understanding of the disease improves.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the etiology of acute pancreatitis.

Acute pancreatitis is the leading gastrointestinal cause of hospitalization in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of acute pancreatitis is increasing in many European and Scandinavian countries due to increased alcohol consumption and better diagnostic capability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a retrospective study from the Netherlands, the observed incidence of acute pancreatitis increased by 28 percent between 1985 and 1995.</p><p>Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions have led to a decrease in mortality from acute pancreatitis, especially in those with severe, often necrotizing pancreatitis. Mortality in acute pancreatitis is usually due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and organ failure in the first two-week period, while after two weeks it is usually due to sepsis and its complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>A multicenter prospective study of 1005 patients with acute pancreatitis reported overall mortality of 5 percent (1.5 percent in mild acute pancreatitis and 17 percent in severe pancreatitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While the overall mortality in all hospitalized patients with acute pancreatitis is approximately 10 percent (range 2 to 22 percent), the mortality in the subset with severe acute pancreatitis may be as high as 30 percent</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of studies of acute pancreatitis, overall mortality was approximately 5 percent, 3 percent, and 17 percent in all cases of acute pancreatitis, interstitial, and necrotizing pancreatitis, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, the mortality rate was 12 percent with sterile necrosis, 30 percent with infected necrosis, and 47 percent with multisystem organ failure. However, mortality rates in necrotizing pancreatitis may be lower in centers of expertise (range 6 to 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H822795\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANICAL AMPULLARY OBSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ampullary obstruction can be induced by gallstone and a variety of disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78423 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallstones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ampullary obstruction can be induced by gallstones. The mechanism by which the passage of gallstones induces pancreatitis is unknown. Two factors have been suggested as the possible initiating event in gallstone pancreatitis: reflux of bile into the pancreatic duct due to transient obstruction of the ampulla during passage of gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; or obstruction at the ampulla secondary to stone(s) or edema resulting from the passage of a stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, only 3 to 7 percent of patients with gallstones develop pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524685462\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gender and stone size may be risk factors for gallstone pancreatitis. The risk of developing acute pancreatitis in patients with gallstones is greater in men; however, the incidence of gallstone pancreatitis is higher in women due to a higher prevalence of gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Small gallstones are associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One study found that stones with a diameter of less than 5 mm were significantly more likely than larger stones to pass through the cystic duct and cause obstruction at the ampulla (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Biliary sludge and microlithiasis'</a> below). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis should be suspected if the patient has a prior history of biliary colic.</p><p>Laboratory values obtained during the acute attack may assist in making the diagnosis.

In this review, a serum ALT concentration of 150 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> or more (approximately a threefold elevation) had a positive predictive value of 95 percent for the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentration was nearly as useful as ALT, while the total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations did not assist in making the diagnosis.</p><p>In addition, all patients with a first attack of acute pancreatitis (irrespective of elevations in liver tests) should have an abdominal ultrasound to search for gallstones, common duct stones, or signs of extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction.</p><p>If gallstone pancreatitis is suspected and there is no history of alcohol abuse, endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram (ERCP) with papillotomy if surgery is not possible or cholecystectomy will decrease the recurrence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, biliary sludge is commonly found in 20 to 40 percent of patients with acute pancreatitis with no obvious cause. In the absence of any other etiology, biliary sludge should be suspected as the cause in patients with acute pancreatitis with a transient elevation in liver tests.</p><p>Biliary sludge is a viscous suspension in gallbladder bile that may contain small stones (&lt;5 mm in diameter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is formed by modification of hepatic bile by gallbladder mucosa; thus, hepatic bile samples may be insufficient for its diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Microscopic analysis of bile in patients with sludge often shows cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Sludge is typically found in patients with functional or mechanical bile stasis, such as those undergoing a prolonged fast, with distal bile duct obstruction, or on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> can complex with bile to form a sludge within the biliary system when its solubility in bile is exceeded; stone formation can rarely occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) of the pancreas are being recognized increasingly and may occasionally present as acute pancreatitis, especially in elderly nonalcoholic males.

Approximately 10 percent of chronic alcoholics develop attacks of clinically acute pancreatitis that are indistinguishable from other forms of acute pancreatitis. </p><p>Alcohol may act by increasing the synthesis of enzymes by pancreatic acinar cells to synthesize the digestive and lysosomal enzymes that are thought to be responsible for acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] or over-sensitization of acini to cholecystokinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.) However, the exact mechanism of pancreatic injury, the genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of pancreatitis in alcoholics, and the reason why only a small proportion of alcoholics develop pancreatitis, are unclear.</p><p>There is debate about the presence of underlying chronic pancreatitis in patients presenting with acute alcoholic pancreatitis. It was initially thought that alcohol causes chronic pancreatitis, and that alcoholics who present with clinically acute pancreatitis have underlying chronic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, some long-term follow-up studies of patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis have shown that not all patients progress to chronic pancreatitis, even with continued alcohol abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This suggests that some alcoholics may have nonprogressive acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SMOKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Until recently, smoking was thought to be a risk factor due to its association with alcohol.

However, the actual incidence of acute pancreatitis in patients with hyperparathyroidism is low. In one large series, for example, acute pancreatitis occurred in only 17 of 1153 patients (1.5 percent) with hyperparathyroidism, a frequency similar to that in the general hospital population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In addition, other potential causes were evident in 11 of the 17 cases, and the symptoms of acute pancreatitis were not ameliorated by treatment of the hypercalcemia.</p><p>The low incidence of pancreatitis in patients with chronic hypercalcemia suggests that other factors (eg, acute elevations of serum calcium) are responsible for pancreatitis in these patients. An experimental model, for example, found that acute calcium infusions in rats led to hyperamylasemia and dose-dependent morphological alterations characteristic of acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC MUTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several genetic mutations have been associated with pancreatitis.

Mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) have been associated with an autosomal recessively inherited pancreatitis. Pancreatitis has also been associated with low penetrance mutations in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), which may act as a disease modifier and lower the threshold for developing pancreatitis from other genetic or environmental factors. Mutations in chymotrypsin C (CTRC) have also been identified in pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Class I and II drugs have the greatest potential for causing acute pancreatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70788\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70788 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>Several medications have been associated with drug induced pancreatitis and a number of different mechanisms of drug-induced pancreatitis have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. These mechanisms include immunologic reactions (eg, 6-mercaptopurine, aminosalicylates, sulfonamides), direct toxic effect (eg, diuretics, sulfonamides), accumulation of a toxic metabolite (valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>), ischemia (diuretics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>), intravascular thrombosis (estrogen), and an increased viscosity of pancreatic juice (diuretics and steroids). Acute pancreatitis has been reported in association with GLP-1 agonist treatment. At the current time, there are insufficient data to know if there is a causal relationship. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H866773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Pancreas'</a>.)</p><p>Drug-induced pancreatitis has no distinguishing clinical features. A high index of suspicion and careful drug history are therefore essential for making the diagnosis. The time course of developing the disorder depends upon the drug involved. As an example, pancreatitis may develop within a few weeks after beginning a drug associated with an immunologically mediated adverse reaction; in this setting, the patient may also have a rash and eosinophilia. In contrast, patients taking valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> may not develop pancreatitis until after many months of use, presumably due to the chronic accumulation of toxic metabolic products. Proving the association with a particular drug may not always be straightforward, even in suspected cases. Thus, patients restarted on their medications should be closely monitored and the drug promptly discontinued if symptoms recur.</p><p>The prognosis of drug-induced pancreatitis is generally excellent and mortality is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIONS AND TOXINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatitis has been associated with the following infections, although the frequency with which these infections lead to pancreatitis is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viruses &ndash; Mumps, coxsackievirus, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, HIV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteria &ndash; Mycoplasma, Legionella, Leptospira, Salmonella</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fungi &ndash; Aspergillus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasites &ndash; Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Ascaris</p><p/><p>Only 70 percent of individuals have a characteristic syndrome caused by the infectious agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Acute pancreatitis may be part of primary HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>] but more frequently occurs as a complication of medications taken to treat the virus (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a>) or opportunistic infections (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>), or due to the opportunistic infection itself (eg, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>The venom of arachnids and reptiles (brown recluse spider, some scorpions, and the Gila monster lizard) has been associated with pancreatitis due to cholinergic stimulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt or penetrating trauma can damage the pancreas, although these injuries are uncommon due to the retroperitoneal location of the gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. The diagnosis of traumatic pancreatitis is difficult and requires a high degree of suspicion. Trauma can range from a mild contusion to a severe crush injury or transection of the gland; the latter usually occurs at the point where the gland crosses over the spine. This injury can cause acute duct rupture and pancreatic ascites. Healing of pancreatic ductal injuries can lead to scarring and stricture of the main pancreatic duct, with resultant obstructive pancreatitis in the gland downstream from the stricture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREAS DIVISUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreas divisum is a common anatomic variant, occurring in approximately 7 percent of autopsy series. It results from failure of the embryologically derived dorsal and ventral pancreas to fuse, resulting in separate pancreatic ductal systems. Whether pancreas divisum causes pancreatitis or is an incidental finding is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas divisum: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic ischemia is an uncommon cause of clinically significant pancreatitis.

In one report, for example, 81 of 300 patients (27 percent) undergoing cardiac surgery developed hyperamylasemia and three patients subsequently developed necrotizing pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Preoperative renal insufficiency, postoperative hypotension, and perioperative administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> were significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pancreatitis is rare during pregnancy. In a retrospective cohort study of 16,000 deliveries, only eight cases of acute pancreatitis were noted; five were due to gallstones and the others were idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A number of cases of hyperlipidemia associated with pancreatitis in pregnancy have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Hyperlipidemic gestational pancreatitis usually occurs only in women with preexisting abnormalities in lipid metabolism, although it is not clear if pregnancy increases the risk of pancreatitis in women who have underlying hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>In a retrospective cohort study of 96 pregnant patients with acute pancreatitis, the majority (96 percent) did not have complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Fetal outcomes were good, although there was a higher risk of prematurity as with other severe, inflammatory diseases. Acute pancreatitis was complicated by disseminated vascular coagulation in the third trimester in 3 percent. Patients who developed pancreatitis in the first trimester had the highest risk of fetal loss (20 percent) and preterm delivery (16 percent). </p><p>The management of acute and chronic pancreatitis in pregnancy is similar to that in nonpregnant individuals. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> is required, adjustments should be made to meet the needs of the gravida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

Autoimmune pancreatitis can sometimes present as acute pancreatitis, although the usual presentation is by weight loss, jaundice, and pancreatic enlargement on imaging, mimicking a neoplasm.

An approach to establishing the cause of acute pancreatitis is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76483 \">table 4</a>). Our approach to determining the etiology of acute pancreatitis, which is largely consistent with guidelines issued by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), is outlined below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history should focus on previous symptoms or documentation of gallstones, alcohol use, history of hypertriglyceridemia or hypercalcemia, family history of pancreatic disease, prescription and nonprescription drug history, history of trauma, and the presence of concomitant autoimmune diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On admission, all patients should have a serum amylase or lipase, triglyceride level, calcium level, and liver biochemistries. Hypertriglyceridemia may be missed if obtained after prolonged fasting. Fasting triglyceride levels should be obtained after recovery once the patient has resumed a normal diet. In patients with suspicion of autoimmune pancreatitis (a very rare cause), antinuclear antibody levels and serum IgG4 levels could be obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abdominal ultrasound should be obtained on admission in all patients with acute pancreatitis to evaluate for cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis. The examination should be repeated after recovery if the initial examination is inadequate or if clinical suspicion for gallstones remains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) even after one attack if the cause is not clear to look for pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors at or near the ampulla, microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct, and early chronic pancreatitis. Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of &quot;idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis&quot;. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with unexplained pancreatitis who are at risk for underlying malignancy (age older than 40) and or worrisome clinical features including weight loss and new onset of diabetes, CT with pancreas protocol or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) should be obtained. Alternatively, EUS can be used to screen for malignancy, ampullary masses, pancreatic ductal dilatation, features of chronic pancreatitis and microlithiasis. If the above imaging tests are abnormal, ERCP should be performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with recurrent episodes of pancreatitis (irrespective of age), EUS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ERCP should be considered. EUS is the preferred initial test. If ERCP is performed, it should be performed by an endoscopist with experience in pancreatic endotherapy. It should be noted that there is significant controversy about sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and pancreas divisum as causes of idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis. If the etiology is not identified on EUS, sphincter of Oddi manometry may be considered to measure biliary and pancreatic pressures. Alternatively, one could proceed to biliary and or pancreatic sphincterotomies without measuring biliary and pancreatic pressures with a presumed diagnosis of type 2 sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We look for an inherited cause of pancreatitis in patients with a strong family history compatible with pancreatitis or with onset of symptoms at a young age (&lt;35 years).
