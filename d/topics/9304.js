Most infection is asymptomatic; clinical manifestations include amebic dysentery and extraintestinal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Worldwide, approximately 50 million people develop colitis or extraintestinal disease, with over 100,000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Extraintestinal manifestations include amebic liver abscess and other more rare manifestations such as pulmonary, cardiac, or brain involvement; these are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraintestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraintestinal Entamoeba histolytica amebiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are four species of intestinal amebae with identical morphologic characteristics: <em>E. histolytica</em>, <em>E. dispar</em>, <em>E. moshkovskii, and E. bangladeshi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Most symptomatic disease is caused by <em>E. histolytica</em>; <em>E. dispar</em> is generally considered nonpathogenic. Reported infections with <em>E. moshkovskii</em> are becoming more frequent, with increasing evidence of its potential pathogenicity emerging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The pathogenic potential of <em>E. bangladeshi </em>remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Issues related to intestinal <em>E. histolytica</em> infection will be reviewed here; issues related to extraintestinal <em>E. histolytica </em>infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraintestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraintestinal Entamoeba histolytica amebiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17143399\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amebiasis occurs worldwide; the prevalence is disproportionately increased in developing countries because of poor socioeconomic conditions and sanitation levels. Infection with <em>E. dispar</em> occurs approximately 10 times more frequently than infection with <em>E. histolytica</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Areas with high rates of amebic infection include India, Africa, Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. The overall prevalence of amebic infection may be as high as 50 percent in some areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In developed countries, amebiasis is generally seen in migrants from and travelers to endemic areas. <em>E. histolytica</em> is not a common cause of travelers' diarrhea, and gastrointestinal infection is uncommon in travelers who have spent less than one month in endemic areas. In one prospective study of German travelers to the tropics, only 0.3 percent had pathogenic <em>E. histolytica</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Institutionalized patients and sexually active homosexuals are also at increased risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In the United States and Europe, homosexual males are principally colonized with nonpathogenic <em>E. dispar</em>; in these regions, HIV-infected patients are not considered to be at increased risk for intestinal or extraintestinal amebiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. In Japan and Taiwan, however, <em>E. histolytica</em> is much more prevalent among male homosexuals. Invasive, extraintestinal amebiasis (eg, hepatic abscesses) are more frequent in HIV-infected patients in these countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17143536\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parasite exists in two forms, a cyst stage (the infective form) and a trophozoite stage (the form that causes invasive disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69977 \">figure 1</a>). Infection occurs following ingestion of amebic cysts; this is usually via contaminated food or water but can be associated with venereal transmission through fecal-oral contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Cysts can remain viable in the environment for weeks to months, and ingestion of a single cyst is sufficient to cause disease. The cysts pass through the stomach to the small intestine, where they excyst to form trophozoites. The trophozoites can invade and penetrate the mucous barrier of the colon, causing tissue destruction and increased intestinal secretion and can thereby ultimately lead to bloody diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The host-parasite interaction is complex, and the virulence of different strains of <em>E. histolytica</em> is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Colitis results after penetration of the trophozoite through the intestinal mucous layer, which otherwise acts as a barrier to invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The trophozoite is able to kill both epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, which is thought to occur through a number of different mechanisms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secretion of proteinases by the trophozoites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lysis of target cells via a contact-dependent mechanism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Killing of mammalian cells by apoptosis (programmed cell death)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of amebapores, a family of small peptides that can form pores in lipid bilayers, resulting in cytolysis of infected cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in intestinal permeability, probably via disruption of tight-junction proteins</p><p/><p>The pathogenicity of amebic trophozoites is facilitated by adherence to colonic epithelial cells via a specific lectin (the galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine lectin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Mammalian cells without N-terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues are resistant to adherence by amebic trophozoites, which is consistent with an important role for the lectin in adhesion. This lectin also plays a role in immunity, since mucosal immunity against the lectin seems to mediate some degree of protection from invasive disease following colonization. One study from Bangladesh showed that children with a mucosal IgA response against the lectin had 86 percent fewer new infections during a one-year period than children without this response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and, when reinfected, had a lower incidence of symptomatic disease over a four-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other amebic molecules such as lipophosphopeptidoglycan, peroxiredoxin, arginase, and lysine, and glutamic acid-rich proteins are also implicated in the pathogenesis of amoebiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of entamoeba infections are asymptomatic; this includes 90 percent of <em>E. histolytica</em> infections. <em>E. dispar</em> is generally considered to be nonpathogenic, although there have been reports describing <em>E. dispar</em> as a potential cause of amebic liver abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and chronic diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While <em>E. moshkovskii</em> was traditionally thought to be nonpathogenic, it has also been associated with diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The pathogenicity of <em>E. bangladeshi</em> remains to be investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Factors that influence whether infection leads to asymptomatic or invasive disease include the <em>E. histolytica</em> strain and host factors such as genetic susceptibility, age, and immune status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Risk factors for severe disease and increased mortality include young age, pregnancy, corticosteroid treatment, malignancy, malnutrition, and alcoholism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A systematic review of patients with amoebic colitis who received steroids for initially misdiagnosed colitis noted that rapid progression of disease following steroid therapy was common, and 25 percent of patients died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Clinical amebiasis generally has a subacute onset, usually over one to three weeks. Symptoms range from mild diarrhea to severe dysentery, producing abdominal pain (12 to 80 percent), diarrhea (94 to 100 percent), and bloody stools (94 to 100 percent), to fulminant amebic colitis. Weight loss occurs in about half of patients, and fever occurs in up to 38 percent. Amebic dysentery is diarrhea with visible blood and mucus in stools and the presence of hematophagous trophozoites (trophozoites with ingested red blood cells) in stools or tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Fulminant colitis with bowel necrosis leading to perforation, and peritonitis has been observed in approximately 0.5 percent of cases; associated mortality rate is more than 40 percent. Toxic megacolon can also develop.</p><p>Amebic colitis has been recognized in asymptomatic patients. Among 5193 asymptomatic individuals in Japan undergoing colonoscopy for evaluation of positive fecal occult blood tests, for example, four were found to have amebic ulcerative lesions in the cecum or ascending colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Rarely, intestinal amebiasis may present as a chronic syndrome of diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain without dysentery, lasting for years and mimicking inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p>Uncommonly, localized colonic infection resulting in a mass of granulation tissue forming an ameboma can occur, mimicking colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Patients with amebomas usually are found to have a tender palpable mass. Other rare complications of amebiasis include perianal cutaneous amebiasis and rectovaginal fistulae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic techniques include microscopy, antigen detection, serology, molecular techniques, and colonoscopy with histological examination. Culture techniques are limited to research settings.</p><p>Diagnosis is best accomplished by the combination of serology or antigen testing together with identification of the parasite in stool or extraintestinal sites (such as liver abscess pus).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5026049\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The demonstration of cysts or trophozoites in the stool suggests intestinal amebiasis, but microscopy cannot differentiate between <em>E. histolytica</em> and <em>E. dispar</em> or <em>E. moshkovskii</em> strains. In addition, microscopy requires specialized expertise and is subject to operator error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Organism excretion can vary; a minimum of three specimens on separate days should be sent to detect 85 to 95 percent of infections. Specimens can be concentrated and stained with iodine to detect cysts. To look for trophozoites, a saline wet mount and a fresh smear stained with iron hematoxylin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Wheatley's trichrome should be performed; fixation with polyvinyl alcohol for delayed staining is often useful.</p><p>Stool specimens are frequently positive for blood in the setting of invasive intestinal amebic disease. The presence of ingested erythrocytes is not pathognomonic for <em>E. histolytica</em> infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57615\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57615 \">picture 1</a>); ingested erythrocytes may also be observed with <em>E. dispar</em>. Fecal leukocytes are not always present since white cells may be destroyed by the organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7060717\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigen detection is sensitive, specific, rapid, easy to perform, and can distinguish between <em>E. histolytica</em> and <em>E. dispar</em>. Stool and serum antigen detection assays that use monoclonal antibodies to bind to epitopes present on pathogenic <em>E. histolytica</em> strains (but not on nonpathogenic <em>E. dispar</em> strains) are commercially available for diagnosis of <em>E. histolytica</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Antigen detection kits using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay, or immunofluorescence have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Antigen detection has many advantages, including ease and rapidity of the tests, capacity to differentiate between strains, greater sensitivity than microscopy, and potential for diagnosis in early infection and in endemic areas (where serology is less useful).</p><p>The TechLab <em>E. histolytica</em> stool antigen test is an ELISA test that is specific for <em>E. histolytica</em>. The assay detects the <em>E. histolytica</em>&ndash;derived <span class=\"nowrap\">Gal/GalNAc</span> lectin in stool specimen; it has a sensitivity of 87 percent and a specificity of &gt;90 percent compared with culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. A study comparing the TechLab <em>E. histolytica</em>&ndash;specific antigen detection test with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays showed comparable sensitivities when performed directly on fresh stool specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serology is a useful diagnostic tool for amebiasis. <em>E. histolytica</em> infection results in the development of antibodies; <em>E. dispar</em> infection does not. Antibodies are detectable within five to seven days of acute infection and may persist for years. Approximately 10 to 35 percent of uninfected individuals in endemic areas have antiamebic antibodies due to previous infection with <em>E. histolytica</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Therefore, negative serology is helpful for exclusion of disease, but positive serology cannot distinguish between acute and previous infection.</p><p>Indirect hemagglutination (IHA) is the most sensitive serologic assay; it is positive in approximately 90 percent of patients with symptomatic intestinal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Agar gel diffusion and counterimmunophoresis are less sensitive than IHA but usually only remain positive for 6 to 12 months, which may make them more useful in endemic areas. A commercially available ELISA that has a sensitivity of 93 percent compared with IHA has also been developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of parasitic DNA or RNA in feces via probes can also be used to diagnose amebic infection and to differentiate between the three different strains.</p><p>PCR techniques can detect <em>E. histolytica</em> in stool specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/32,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,35,36</a>]. Studies have shown that PCR is significantly more sensitive than microscopy and that it was 100 percent specific for <em>E. histolytica</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. PCR is about 100 times more sensitive than fecal antigen tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>A number of investigators have developed PCR methods for the diagnosis of intestinal amebiasis and differentiation between pathogenic and nonpathogenic amebae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. These methods are highly sensitive and specific research tools but are generally not yet commercially available for diagnostic clinical testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual inspection of the colon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sigmoidoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colonoscopy can be performed to make the diagnosis of amebiasis and to exclude other causes of symptoms. However, colonoscopy is not appropriate as a routine diagnostic tool since presence of amebic ulcerations increase the likelihood of perforation during instillation of air to expand the colon.</p><p>Cecum and colon are the most common sites of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In one study, endoscopic findings of amebic colitis (including discrete ulcers or erosions) were observed in the cecum, rectum, ascending colon, transverse colon, sigmoid colon, and descending colon (93, 45, 28, 25, 20, and 15 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Scrapings or biopsy specimens, best taken from the edge of ulcers, may be positive for cysts or trophozoites on microscopy, and antigen testing for <em>E. histolytica</em> may be positive. Colonic lesions in amebic dysentery range from nonspecific mucosal thickening and inflammation to classic flask-shaped amebic ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66341\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66341 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F96413\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96413 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9471115\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of <em>E. histolytica</em> amebiasis includes other causes of acute diarrhea or bloody stools, particularly bacterial pathogens including <em>Shigella, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile,</em> and some <em>Vibrio</em> species. These are distinguished based on culture results or molecular diagnostic assays. Noninfectious etiologies include ischemic bowel and inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All <em>E. histolytica</em> infections should be treated, even in the absence of symptoms, given the potential risk of developing invasive disease and the risk of spread to family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The goals of antibiotic therapy of intestinal amebiasis are to eliminate the invading trophozoites and to eradicate intestinal carriage of the organism.</p><p><em>E. dispar</em> infections do not require treatment. In countries where amebic infections are endemic, asymptomatic patients incidentally found to have stools positive for amebae are frequently presumed to have infection with <em>E. dispar</em> and are not further evaluated or treated. As antigen tests that can differentiate between <em>E. dispar</em> and <em>E. histolytica</em> become more widely available in these countries, this practice may change. The need for treatment of <em>E. moshkovskii </em>is uncertain; it may be reasonable to treat symptomatic infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7060848\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive colitis is generally managed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (alternative therapies include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a>, ornidazole, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitazoxanide</a>), followed by a luminal agent (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a>, diiodohydroxyquin, or diloxanide furoate) to eliminate intraluminal cysts. A 10-day course of metronidazole eliminates intraluminal infection in many cases, but a second agent is still warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Asymptomatic patients with <em>E. histolytica</em> (and not <em>E. dispar</em> or <em>E. moshkovskii</em>) should be treated with an intraluminal agent alone.</p><p>Dosing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> is 500 to 750 mg by mouth three times daily for 7 to 10 days in adults and 35 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in three divided doses for 7 to 10 days in children. Shorter duration of metronidazole is generally not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

Amebic cysts are resistant to chlorine at the levels used in water supplies, but disinfection with iodine may be effective. Avoiding sexual practices that may lead to fecal-oral contact is also advisable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travel-advice#H22624013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travel advice&quot;, section on 'Behavioral precautions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccine development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence of partial acquired immunity to the organism. Protection from invasive disease has been associated with mucosal IgA antibodies to the amebic adherence lectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and Gal-lectin based vaccinations have conferred some protection in various animal models against <em>E. histolytica</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, recurrent intestinal infection and persistent colonization may occur despite detectable antiamebic antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Thus, it seems probable that acquired, but incomplete, immunity against infection occurs, and a vaccine that can reduce infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive disease may therefore be feasible.</p><p>The relative importance of systemic and mucosal, cellular, and humoral immunity is unclear. Several amebic proteins associated with virulence have been identified and are being studied as potential vaccine components. Development of both parenteral and oral vaccines for humans is in progress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-entamoeba-histolytica-amebiasis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7061138\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal amebiasis is caused by the protozoan <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>. There are three species of intestinal amebae with identical morphologic characteristics: <em>E. histolytica</em>, <em>E. dispar</em>, and <em>E. moshkovskii</em>. <em>E. dispar</em> is nonpathogenic and does not cause clinical disease; most symptomatic disease is caused by <em>E. histolytica</em>. The pathogenic potential of <em>E. moshkovskii</em> remains unclear. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amebiasis occurs worldwide; the prevalence is disproportionately increased in developing countries because of poor socioeconomic conditions and sanitation levels. Areas with high rates of amebic infection include India, Africa, Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. In developed countries, amebiasis is generally seen in migrants from and travelers to endemic areas. (See <a href=\"#H17143399\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical amebiasis generally has a subacute onset, usually over one to three weeks. Symptoms range from mild diarrhea to severe dysentery, producing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stools. Fulminant colitis with bowel necrosis leading to perforation and peritonitis can occur, as can toxic megacolon. Amebic colitis has been recognized in asymptomatic patients as well. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is best accomplished by the combination of serology or antigen testing together with identification of the parasite in stool or extraintestinal sites (such as liver abscess pus). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All <em>E. histolytica</em> infections should be treated, even in the absence of symptoms, given the potential risk of developing invasive disease and the risk of spread to family members. The goals of antibiotic therapy of intestinal amebiasis are to eliminate the invading trophozoites and to eradicate intestinal carriage of the organism. We suggest treatment of invasive colitis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest subsequent treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a> to eliminate intraluminal cysts (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Dosing is outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of amebic infection in travelers to endemic areas involves avoidance of untreated water in endemic areas and uncooked food, such as fruit and vegetables, that may have been washed in local water. Amebic cysts are resistant to chlorine at the levels used in water supplies, but disinfection with iodine may be effective.
