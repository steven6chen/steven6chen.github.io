Non-narcotic medical therapies are often inadequate, and opioids commonly induce nausea, constipation, and other side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Non-pharmacologic therapies are commonly administered with the aim of improving pain control and quality of life, while reducing the risk of drug-induced side effects. Such therapies include celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) with injection of alcohol in patients with pancreatic cancer or celiac plexus block (CPB) using steroids in patients with chronic pancreatitis. </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of CPN and CPB in the management of pain occurring secondary to pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis, respectively, while focusing on endosonographic methods. It will also briefly review other applications of endoscopic ultrasound guided neurolysis, as well as emerging data concerning direct celiac ganglia neurolysis (CGN) and block (CGB), the most recently introduced technical variation of the standard technique.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and an overview of palliative treatments for pancreatic cancer are discussed separately.

The splanchnic nerves are located above and posterior to the diaphragm and anterior most often to the 12th thoracic vertebra. The celiac plexus is located below and anterior to the diaphragm and surrounds the origin of the celiac trunk. The celiac plexus is comprised of a dense network of ganglia and interconnecting fibers. Celiac ganglia are typically located between T12 and L2 and, in most patients, two to five ganglia are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The celiac plexus transmits the sensation of pain for the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The nerves that supply the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] receive nociceptive stimulation and then transmit this pain information to the celiac plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Stimuli reach the thalamus and cortex of the brain and this information is perceived as pain. Descending inhibitory mechanisms may also modulate the ascending pain information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NON-EUS METHODS (FOR CELIAC &quot;PLEXUS&quot; NEUROLYSIS AND BLOCK)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPN and CPB can be performed percutaneously, surgically, or under endosonographic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The retrocrural or classic approach involves injection of the solution so that diffusion occurs over the splanchnic nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Modifications have been created in an attempt to improve the accuracy of needle placement and pain relief, while reducing procedure-related complications. These techniques differ with respect to the route of needle insertion, use of radiologic guidance versus a blind procedure, and chemical composition of the injectate. The anterocrural or &quot;true&quot; CPN results in injection anterior to the diaphragm thereby diffusing over the celiac ganglia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy for pancreatic cancer pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While CPN is considered safe, it provides limited benefit in terms of the degree and duration of pain relief and little advance has been made since the original description in 1914 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 24 studies with 1145 patients who were treated with percutaneous CPN for the palliation of cancer pain (63 percent with pancreatic cancer), good to excellent pain relief was noted in 70 to 90 percent of patients up to three months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>A more recent meta-analysis examined six randomized trials with 358 patients undergoing percutaneous celiac plexus block for pancreatic cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At four weeks, patients in the treatment arm had a significant improvement in pain compared with the control arm. The difference between the treatment and control arms was -0.42 on a 10-point visual analog scale (with lower values corresponding to better pain control). The difference at eight weeks was -0.44. In addition, opioid consumption was significantly lower in the treatment arm.</p><p>The following illustrate the range of findings in individual reports.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 137 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who had surgical chemical splanchnicectomy, mean pain scores were significantly lower in the CPN group compared with placebo at two, four, and six months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another controlled trial included 100 patients with pain from unresectable pancreatic cancer who were randomly assigned to percutaneously administered CPN or systemic analgesic therapy alone with a sham injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Opioid consumption and the frequency of opioid side effects were similar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A double-blind study involving 24 patients found that percutaneously administered CPN was associated with a significant reduction in analgesic consumption and drug-related side effects compared with patients treated with drugs alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fourth study suggested that percutaneously administered CPN combined with systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> may prevent deterioration in quality of life by improving the duration of the analgesic effect and by reducing the morphine dose and side effects compared with treatment with NSAIDs and morphine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fifth study examined the efficacy of laparoscopic CPB in patients with pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The study included 20 patients who were undergoing <span class=\"nowrap\">diagnostic/staging</span> laparoscopy for unresectable pancreatic cancer.

The meta-analysis described above concluded that despite a few reports favoring one technique over another, efficacy of pain relief was not influenced by the technical approach or the use of radiologic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy for chronic pancreatitis pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies evaluating percutaneous CPB for controlling pain from chronic pancreatitis have been small retrospective case series and have reported marginal benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. One study found that percutaneous CPN effectively relieved pain associated with malignant disease, but was not as effective for benign disease (73 versus 37 percent response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. While limited data suggest percutaneous CPN produces short-term pain relief (weeks to months), extended pain relief typically requires repeat therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EUS METHODS (FOR PERFORMING CELIAC &quot;PLEXUS&quot; NEUROLYSIS AND BLOCK)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPN has been performed under EUS guidance, which compared with the percutaneous approaches, has the theoretical benefits of enhancing needle localization and spread of the injectate, minimizing complications and improving pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Patients are questioned regarding allergies and use of anticoagulants. Informed consent is obtained with specific attention to the unique complications associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">CPN/CPB</span>. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis using conscious sedation, unless analgesic consumption <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> comorbidities require monitored anesthesia care. Patients are initially hydrated with 500 to 1000 mL normal saline to minimize the risk of hypotension. Throughout the procedure patients are continuously monitored by an automated noninvasive blood pressure device and pulse oximeter.</p><p>Linear array endosonographic imaging (GF-UC30P, Olympus Corporation, Center Valley, PA; GF UC140P-AL5 or GF UC 160 PAT8, Pentax Precision Instruments, Orangeburg, NY) from the posterior lesser curve of the gastric fundus permits identification of the aorta, which appears in a longitudinal plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77966\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77966 \">image 1</a>). The aorta is traced distally to the celiac trunk, which is the first major branch below the diaphragm.</p><p>It was initially believed that the celiac plexus could not be identified as a discrete structure, but instead located based upon its position relative to the celiac trunk. However, it is now appreciated that celiac plexus can be recognized directly (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Color Doppler is used to confirm the vascular nature of the adjacent structures. A 22-gauge needle is primed with saline to remove air and then placed through the biopsy channel and affixed to the hub.</p><p>A dedicated 20-gauge needle with a &quot;spray&quot; needle with multiple side holes is available, which facilitates spread of the injected material (EUSN-20-CPN: Cook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, NC). The selected needle is inserted under EUS guidance immediately adjacent and anterior to the lateral aspect of the aorta at the level of the celiac trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81618\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81618 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79530\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79530 \">image 2</a>). The needle is flushed with 3cc of normal saline to remove any tissue acquired during insertion. An aspiration test is performed to rule out vessel penetration prior to each injection. For CPN in pancreatic cancer patients, 10 mL (0.25 percent) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> is injected followed by 10 mL dehydrated (98 percent) alcohol. The alcohol, which produces an echogenic cloud, may lead to discomfort despite sedation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57496\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57496 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>Before withdrawing the needle, it should be flushed with 3 mL normal saline to prevent seeding of the needle track with alcohol, which may produce transient severe postprocedure pain. The entire process is then repeated on the opposite side of the aorta. Occasionally, altered anatomy resulting from significant lymphadenopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bulky tumors may require injection of the entire solution into one &quot;unilateral&quot; site. Left-sided unilateral injection is more likely to be associated with insufficient pain relief. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy for pancreatic cancer pain'</a> below.)</p><p>After the procedure, which takes about 15 minutes, the vital signs are monitored for two hours. Prior to discharge, the blood pressure is checked in both a supine and erect position to assess for orthostasis.</p><p>An alternative approach that has been described for patients with advanced abdominal cancer involves EUS-guided broad plexus neurolysis (BPN), in which the injection is performed at the level of the superior mesenteric artery, resulting in a broader distribution of neurolysis. In one trial with 67 patients assigned to either conventional CPN or BPN, patients in the BPN group had significantly better short- and long-term pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>For CPB in patients with chronic pancreatitis, some authorities substitute a steroid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> suspension 40 mg-bilateral, 80-unilateral, Fujisawa USA, Deerfield, IL) in place of alcohol. Although use in patients with benign disease is controversial, a few centers administer a small volume of alcohol (4cc-bilateral, 8cc-unilateral) in addition to steroid to increase the neurolysis. If alcohol, which is bactericidal, is not given along with the steroid, we suggest administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly if the patient is receiving acid-suppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy for pancreatic cancer pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of small trials have evaluated EUS CPN for pancreatic cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>]. In one meta-analysis, EUS CPN decreased pain by a mean visual analog score of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.37-0.82) at eight weeks in cases compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a second meta-analysis, the proportion of patients with pain relief was 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the second meta-analysis, it was noted that patients who had injections on both sides of the celiac artery had a higher rate of pain relief than those who only received injections on one side (85 versus 46 percent). A third meta-analysis included 119 patients and found that EUS CPN alleviated abdominal pain in 73 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The early use of CPN in patients with inoperable cancer may improve pain relief compared with conventional pain management. In a randomized trial, 580 patients with suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma with related pain underwent EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Inoperable adenocarcinoma was found in 96 patients, who were assigned to either CPN or conventional pain management. At three months, patients treated with CPN had significantly greater pain relief, with a trend toward lower <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> consumption. There was no difference between the groups in quality of life scores or survival.</p><p>A study of 47 patients identified factors associated with poor responses to CPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Insufficient pain relief was more likely among patients with direct tumor invasion of the celiac plexus compared with those who lacked direct invasion (73 versus 28 percent) and among those in whom ethanol was only distributed to the left side of the celiac plexus (47 versus 6 percent).</p><p>No large trials have directly compared EUS compared with percutaneous approaches, limiting the ability to directly compare their efficacy and safety. Nevertheless, EUS-guided CPN performed for the palliation of pancreatic cancer pain appears to be as safe and effective as CPN performed by other techniques. Furthermore, an advantage of the EUS approach is that it can be performed while staging and obtaining biopsies of the tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy for chronic pancreatitis pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accumulating experience suggests that EUS guided celiac plexus block (CPB) performed with steroid injection rather than ethanol may be effective for the control of pain related to chronic pancreatitis, although its role has not yet been well established.</p><p>In two meta-analyses, the rate of pain relief for patients with chronic pancreatitis following EUS-guided CPB was 51 to 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. One of the largest studies looking at EUS-guided CPB for chronic pancreatitis pain included 90 patients. That study found a significant improvement in overall pain scores in 55 percent of patients at four and eight weeks of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A persistent benefit beyond 12 and 24 weeks was observed in 26 and 10 percent of patients, respectively.

In comparison with the surrounding retroperitoneal fat, the ganglia are echo-poor and often display similar echogenicity to that of the left adrenal gland. Central echo-rich strands or foci are present, and echo-poor threads can be seen arising from ganglia. These threads connect to the ganglia, or course along the anterior surface of the celiac trunk. Color Doppler ultrasonography confirms little or no flow within these structures. A review of the CT images of patients with visualized celiac ganglia demonstrated comma-shaped structures between the celiac artery and left adrenal gland corresponding to the ganglia visualized by EUS.</p><p>In contrast to lymph node fine-needle aspiration (FNA), aspiration of ganglia typically induces transient pain during the FNA and the corresponding cytologic examination displays nerve cell bodies in the absence of lymphocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54517\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54517 \">picture 1</a>). EUS trucut biopsy specimens have also been performed, again inducing transient pain with corresponding histology and revealing nerve cells in the absence of lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>It was initially unclear how often ganglia could be visualized by EUS and whether the presence of pathological factors (eg, inflammation or malignancy) was necessary for their visualization. We evaluated 200 consecutive nonselected patients and documented ganglia visualization in 81 percent of patients overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The rate of ganglia detection varied based upon the instrument used (radial EUS 79 percent versus linear EUS 86 percent) and among endosonographers (65 to 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patient age, alcohol consumption, cigarette use, body mass index, or the presence of chronic abdominal pain or malignancy had no bearing on the identification or number of ganglia identified.</p><p>The high rate of ganglion visualization and the lack of correlation with other pathologic processes suggested that factors such as edema, fibrosis, inflammation, and malignancy were unnecessary for the visualization of ganglia. Similar conclusions were reached in a later study involving 57 consecutive patients using radial echoendoscopy in which the ganglia were detected in 89 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Our general approach is to target as many ganglia as possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76500\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76500 \">figure 2</a>). We position the needle tip within the central point of ganglia smaller than 1.0 cm within the axis of the needle plane.

Intraganglia injection is typically accompanied by the immediate onset of pain, which manifests as an abrupt increase in patient movement, attempted verbalization, altered pulse and respiration including patients undergoing anesthesia-assisted sedation. These manifestations resolve abruptly within a few seconds after ganglia injection.

An initial report included 33 patients who underwent 36 procedures for unresectable pancreatic cancer (CGN n = 17, CGB n = 1) or chronic pancreatitis (CGN n = 5, CGB n = 13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Injection included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> (0.25 percent) and alcohol (99 percent) for CGN, or bupivacaine (0.25 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (DepoMedrol, [80 mg per 2cc] for CGB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Ganglia could be seen and accessed in 33 of 35 patients (95 percent). In two patients, the ganglia could not be identified (n = 1) or were diminutive (n = 1) and standard techniques were used.</p><p>In patients with chronic pancreatitis, four of five patients (80 percent) who received alcohol reported pain relief versus 5 of 13 (38 percent; p = 0.11) who received steroids. When pain relief occurred, the benefit was rated as complete or partial in four and five patients, respectively. Use of narcotics increased, remained equivalent, and decreased in 0, 15, and 3 patients, respectively.</p><p>A randomized trial suggested that CGN may be superior to CPN for patients with chronic pancreatitis. The trial included 68 patients who were assigned to either undergo CGN or CPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The primary endpoint was a response to treatment, which was defined as a decrease in pain score of three or more points from baseline (on a scale of 0 to 10) on post-procedure day seven. Secondary endpoints included complete pain relief (a pain score of 0 or 1), duration of pain relief, and complications. Four of 34 patients in the CGN group (18 percent) did not undergo neurolysis because the celiac ganglia were not identified on EUS. On intention-to-treat analysis, more patients in the CGN group compared with the CPN reported a positive response (74 versus 46 percent). The complete response rate was also higher for the CGN group (50 versus 18 percent). There was no difference between the groups with regard to duration of pain relief or complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of initial pain exacerbation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the study described above, patients were categorized as having &quot;immediate&quot; pain when discomfort was observed while the needle was within the ganglia, which was distinguished from &quot;initial&quot; pain exacerbation, which began in the recovery room or soon thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thirteen (36 percent) patients (CGN, n = 7; CGB, n = 6) experienced an &quot;initial&quot; pain exacerbation lasting a mean of 2.2 days for CGN and 1.1 days for CGB. Hospitalization was required in three patients (CGN [n = 1, one day], CGB [n = 2, one and two days]), and another patient who underwent CGB was evaluated in the emergency department and treated with opioid analgesics without hospitalization.</p><p>Initial pain exacerbation predicted enhanced pain relief at follow-up. For pancreatic cancer, seven of seven patients (100 percent) who had an initial pain exacerbation reported eventual efficacy of CGN versus 9 of 11 who did not have pain (81 percent; p = 0.23). For patients with chronic pancreatitis, 5 of 6 (83 percent) versus 4 of 12 (33 percent; p = 0.05) had subsequent pain relief depending on whether they did or did not experience an initial exacerbation of their pain. For the group as a whole, eventual pain relief was more often reported in patients who developed initial pain compared with those who did not (12 of 13 (92 percent) versus 13 of 23 (57 percent; p&lt;0.03), respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147380561\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER APPLICATIONS OF EUS-GUIDED NEUROLYSIS AND NERVE BLOCK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are lacking on the use of EUS-guided celiac plexus and ganglia interventions for other indications.</p><p>EUS-guided neurolysis and nerve block have been studied for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain. In a pilot study of five patients with pelvic pain due to cancer, EUS-guided injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> and alcohol in to the superior hypogastric plexus resulted in a mean reduction in pain scores from 9 to 3 after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The pain relief persisted from 2 to 16 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, serious complications with CPN or CPB are uncommon. As an example, in a series of 189 EUS-guided CPBs and 31 CPNs, four complications were observed (overall complication rate of 1.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Three occurred after CPB (1.6 percent) and one after CPN (3.2 percent). The complications included asymptomatic hypotension (CPN), retroperitoneal abscess (CPB) and severe self-limited postprocedural pain in two patients (CPB).</p><p>Transient diarrhea and hypotension are common manifestations of the sympathetic blockade that can occur following CPN or CPB and may be seen in up to 38 and 44 percent of patients, respectively, whether performed by EUS or percutaneous approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The celiac plexus is a dense network of abdominal visceral afferent nerve fibers and sympathetic fibers of the splanchnic nerves. Thus, interruption of the plexus with an alcohol injection not only reduces pain transmission from the abdominal organs (pancreas, liver, stomach, kidney, small bowel, and colon) but can also result in a sympathetic blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Clinical manifestations of sympathetic blockade can include diarrhea and hypotension due to a relative unopposed visceral parasympathetic activity. In addition, cephalic spread of the neurolytic agent may result in involvement of the cardiac nerves and plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In the report of direct ganglia injection described above, transient hypotension defined by a decrease in blood pressure greater than 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic occurring within three minutes of upright tilt developed in 12 patients (33 percent), two of whom required additional fluid administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. For CPB, diarrhea was reported in two patients (11 percent) lasting one and two weeks. Four patients (22 percent) with pancreatic cancer subjectively noted marked (n = 2) and mild (n = 2) improvement of their narcotic induced constipation. No other complications were reported.</p><p>In our series of 58 patients who underwent EUS-CPN for pancreatic cancer pain, self-limiting diarrhea lasting less than 48 hours occurred in 9 percent of patients and one patient had persistent symptoms that lasted for seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Transient hypotension reflected by a fall in the blood pressure by 10 to 15 percent was observed in approximately 20 percent of cases. All episodes responded to infusion of intravenous fluids and no patient experienced a sustained episode of hypotension. Transient abdominal pain lasting less than 48 hours was noted in 9 percent of patients.</p><p>Infectious complications of EUS-CPB are uncommon. In a series of 90 patients, only one developed an infectious complication (a peripancreatic abscess), which resolved with a two-week course of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The authors speculated that there may have been a predisposition to infection because the patient was taking a proton pump inhibitor at the time of the procedure and may have had gastroduodenal colonization with bacteria. As a result, they suggested that prophylactic antibiotics should be considered in patients who are receiving acid suppression when a steroid agent is used for the CPB. The bactericidal nature of ethanol (used in patients with malignancy) appears to minimize this risk for infection and we do not routinely use antibiotics in this setting irrespective of concurrent usage of antacid agents.</p><p>Major complications from percutaneous CPN are rare, occurring in approximately 1 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These include lower extremity weakness and paresthesias, paraplegia, pneumothorax, renal puncture, and prolonged gastroparesis or diarrhea. Neurologic complications related to CPN are most commonly associated with the posterior approach and appear to occur as a consequence of ischemia of the spinal cord or injection directly into the spinal cord or somatic nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, paraplegia has also been reported with intraoperative celiac plexus block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Ischemia of the spinal cord may result from thrombosis or spasm of the artery of Adamkiewicz, which is located on the left of the spine between T8 and L4 and perfuses the lower two-thirds of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The anterior approach may decrease the incidence of neurologic complications since the needle does not traverse the perispinal region or somatic nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A fatality related to gastric and aortic necrosis following CPN has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer and abdominal pain requiring opioid analgesics are potential candidates for CPN. The timing of the block relative to pain onset appears to be an important predictor of pain response in patients with pancreatic cancer. In one study, CPN was more effective when the block was performed early after pain onset rather than late in its course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Early pancreatic cancer pain appears to derive mainly from the celiac plexus, while pain during the terminal stages of disease may also involve other visceral and somatic nerves. Thus, CPN performed soon after the onset of pain from pancreatic cancer may increase the rate of response.</p><p>Selection of patients with pain related to chronic pancreatitis for CPN is less clear. Patients with pain refractory to high doses of opiates may be appropriate candidates although the response may be minimal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EUS-CPN appears to be as safe and effective as other methods for performing CPN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EUS-CPN may be the most cost-effective of all CPN techniques since tumors can be staged and biopsied at the time of CPN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain relief lasting for up to 24 weeks has been observed in approximately 70 percent of patients.
