The organisms proved difficult to isolate and characterize. Analysis of <em>Bartonella</em> 16S ribosomal RNA was instrumental in identifying and classifying this species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although <em>Bartonella</em> species are frequently described as emerging pathogens, <em>Bartonella</em> infection was likely an ancient bacterial disease in humans, as suggested by the detection of <em>Bartonella</em> <em>quintana</em> in the dental pulp of a human that died more than 4000 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The microbiology and pathogenesis of <em>Bartonella</em> infections will be reviewed here.

Prior to 1993, the only member of the <em>Bartonella</em> genus that had been identified was <em>Bartonella bacilliformis</em>. In 1993, DNA hybridization data led Brenner and coworkers to propose to unite the genera <em>Bartonella</em> and <em>Rochalimaea</em>, retaining the genus name <em>Bartonella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 1995, members of the genus <em>Grahamella</em> were merged with the <em>Bartonella</em> genus, but <em>Grahamella</em> spp are not known to cause human disease.</p><p>The three most important <em>Bartonella</em> spp known to cause human disease are <em>B. bacilliformis</em>, <em>B. quintana</em>, and <em>Bartonella henselae</em>. Other <em>Bartonella</em> spp reported to have caused disease in humans, but whose role is less well defined, are <em>Bartonella elizabethae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], <em>Bartonella vinsonii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], <em>Bartonella clarridgeiae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], <em>Bartonella grahamii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], <em>Bartonella koehlerae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], <em>Bartonella alsatica</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and <em>Bartonella rochalimae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Infection with <em>B. elizabethae</em> may be more common than previously appreciated. As an example, investigators performed <em>Bartonella</em> serologic testing on samples collected in 1997 and 1998 from 204 injection drug users in New York City and found 46 percent had positive serologic reactions to <em>B. elizabethae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, one group of investigators used 16S RNA gene sequencing to identify a new serogroup of <em>B. henselae</em>, termed serogroup &quot;Marseille&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Although analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA sequences have characteristically been used to differentiate <em>Bartonella</em> spp, investigators have determined that nucleotide base sequence data for a 940-bp fragment of the citrate synthase-encoding gene (gltA) appears more useful than the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence data for investigating the evolutionary relationships of <em>Bartonella</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Phylogenetic studies have determined that the highly virulent pathogen, <em>B. bacilliformis</em>, is the sole representative of an ancestral lineage, and other <em>Bartonella</em> species that cause human disease have evolved in a separate lineage; the evolution of the newer species has correlated with their adaptation to distinct mammalian reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Bartonella</em> spp are gram-negative, pleomorphic bacteria that stain very poorly in tissues using Gram stain but will stain black with silver-impregnated stains, such as the Warthin-Starry stain. The organisms are slow growing and regardless of which special techniques are used, typically require at least seven days before growth can be detected. Routine culture procedures have low yield, unless the cultures are held for an extended period. Growth of <em>Bartonella</em> spp is optimized when specimens are incubated in fresh media at 35 to 37&ordm;C with 5 to 10 percent CO2 concentrations and greater than 40 percent humidity; some of the <em>Bartonella</em> spp, such as <em>B. bacilliformis</em>, may grow better at lower temperatures (25 to 30&ordm;C). The preferred medium is freshly prepared rabbit-heart infusion agar, but the organism can grow on various forms of chocolate or blood agar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p><em>Bartonella</em> typically does not trigger automated CO2 detection systems. <em>Bartonella</em> has been identified by using acridine orange staining of blood culture broth after seven days of incubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One group has described a chemically defined, cell-free, extract-free, liquid medium that supports the growth of <em>Bartonella</em> spp, including growth from clinical specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another report used a novel, chemically-modified, insect-based liquid culture medium that allowed the growth of at least seven <em>Bartonella</em> species, including <em>B. henselae</em> and <em>B. quintana</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Growth of <em>Bartonella</em> from biopsy specimens has also been successful using tissue homogenates co-cultivated with endothelial cell monolayers, but microbiology laboratories do not routinely perform these techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL RESERVOIRS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most <em>Bartonella</em> spp that cause human disease are associated with well-defined mammalian reservoirs, including humans, domestic animals, rodents, and wild animals. More recently, the identified range of natural reservoirs for <em>Bartonella</em> species has expanded to include bats and marine animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. These mammalian reservoirs can have prolonged infection with <em>Bartonella</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic evidence suggests that cats serve as the major reservoir for <em>B. henselae</em> human infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. One study in northern California documented <em>B. henselae</em> bacteremia in 56 percent of cats less than one year of age and 34 percent of those at least one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Moreover, 90 percent of the cats less than one year old and 77 percent one year or older had a positive <em>B. henselae</em> serology test. One report found that <em>Bartonella</em> bacteremia was more common in cats owned by patients with CSD compared with control cats (17 of 19 [89 percent] versus 7 of 25 [28 percent], p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thirteen of the 19 bacteremic cats remained culture positive during the ensuing 12-month period. Among the <em>Bartonella</em> isolates from these cats, 23 were identified as <em>B. henselae</em> and one isolate appeared to be a new <em>Bartonella</em> spp. In a follow-up study, investigators examined the role of cat contacts as the source of human infection and found four of five <em>B. henselae</em> isolates from human-cat pairs had closely related pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns, thus further strengthening the proposed role of cats in transmitting this organism to humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Cats infrequently display clinical signs of <em>B. henselae</em> infection, even when they are persistently infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, autopsy findings on these cats often show abnormal histopathology, including peripheral lymph node hyperplasia, splenic follicular hyperplasia, lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">cholangitis/pericholangitis,</span> lymphocytic hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis, and interstitial lymphocytic nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There may be strain differences in the ability to cause overt infection in cats. Among nine cats inoculated with a virulent strain of <em>B. henselae</em> (LSU16), for example, all developed an inoculation papule, a febrile illness, bacteremia by day 14, a peak in bacteremia at 14 to 28 days postinfection, and strong antibody responses to <em>B. henselae</em>, as determined by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In France, <em>B. clarridgeiae</em> was detected in the blood of 15 of 94 stray cats (16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the San Francisco area, two new species of <em>Bartonella</em>, including <em>B. koehlerae</em>, were characterized from 25 isolates recovered from cats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Expanded information regarding the frequency and natural history of <em>B. koehlerae</em> infection in cats will require further investigation.

Both of these organisms can establish prolonged infection in humans, and invasion and persistent infection of red blood cells play a major role in <em>Bartonella</em> establishing chronic infection in humans. In addition, the persistence of organisms in red blood cells enables transmission via blood-sucking arthropods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rats, mice, and dogs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an extensive analysis of rats from 13 sites in the United States and Portugal, <em>Bartonella</em> spp were isolated from the blood of 63 of 325 <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> (19 percent) and 11 of 92 <em>Rattus</em> <em>rattus</em> (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The <em>Bartonella</em> spp isolated from these rats were most similar to <em>B. elizabethae</em>. <em>B. elizabethae</em> has also been isolated from a rat in Peru [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a subsequent study, multiple <em>Bartonella</em> species were isolated from <em>R</em>. <em>norvegicus </em>and<em> R. rattus</em> that were captured in New Orleans and New York City, and flea infestation predicted isolation of <em>Bartonella</em> in <em>R</em>. <em>norvegicus</em> in both cities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].<em> B. vinsonii</em> appears to have both mice and dogs as reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These pathogens, however, do not play a major role in human disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308802955\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTHROPOD VECTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308802963\"><span class=\"h2\">Fleas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cat flea, <em>Ctenocephalides felis</em>, serves as the major vector for cat-to-cat transmission of <em>B. henselae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Cats that harbor fleas infested with <em>B. henselae</em> can become infectious to humans after they scratch or bite the fleas, a process whereby the cat inoculates its claws or saliva with flea feces that are rich with <em>B. henselae</em> organisms. Subsequently, these cats can infect humans with <em>B. henselae</em> through a scratch, bite, or lick. Cat-to-human transmission most often occurs through cat scratches that result in intradermal inoculation of the contaminated flea feces. Some data suggest fleas may directly transmit <em>B. henselae</em> to humans, but this remains unproven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308802971\"><span class=\"h2\">Lice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human-to-human transmission of <em>B. quintana</em> occurs via contact with the human body louse (<em>Pediculus humanus corporis</em>) or head louse (<em>Pediculus humanus capitis</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], specifically as a result of cutaneous inoculation of lice feces on the skin through scratching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In one study, investigators found a higher viability of <em>B</em>. <em>quintana</em> in body lice feces compared with head lice feces, and this finding correlated with a relatively weakened gastrointestinal tract immune response to <em>B</em>. <em>quintana</em> in the body lice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This study provides a pathogenic mechanism to explain the greater role body lice have relative to head lice in the transmission of <em>B. quintana</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308802979\"><span class=\"h2\">Sandflies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>Lutzomyia verrucarum </em>sandfly has clearly been identified as the vector for <em>B. bacilliformis</em>. In one study, blood was surveyed from 50 animals living in the homes of 11 families whose children had recent bartonellosis in an endemic region of Peru [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. <em>Bartonella</em>-like bacteria were recovered from four of nine small rodents, but none of the strains was classified as <em>B. bacilliformis</em> using serologic and genotypic methods. Five of these isolates probably represented three previously unrecognized <em>Bartonella</em> spp, and one was a likely strain of <em>B. elizabethae</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308802987\"><span class=\"h2\">Ticks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unclear if ticks transmit <em>Bartonella</em>. Although several reports have suggested possible tick transmission of <em>Bartonella</em> species to humans, subsequent studies have reported conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Details of the complex pathogenesis of <em>Bartonella</em> infection in humans has expanded, with an improved understanding of how <em>Bartonella</em> causes a persistent, intracellular infection that escapes both innate and acquired immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Most existing data have found that <em>Bartonella</em> primarily infects erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/17,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,48</a>].</p><p>Experts have generated a model for the life cycle of <em>Bartonella</em> infection that begins with the inoculation of <em>Bartonella</em> into either a mammalian or human reservoir host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Following cutaneous inoculation, the <em>Bartonella</em> organisms (which are not capable of immediately infecting erythrocytes) appear to establish early dermal infection in migratory cells that transport the <em>Bartonella</em> organisms to vascular endothelial cells, and perhaps other cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The <em>Bartonella</em> organisms then adhere to and invade endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Subsequently, the organisms spill into and seed the bloodstream where intraerythrocytic infection occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>The propensity to parasitize erythrocytes stems from <em>Bartonella</em>&rsquo;s requirement for heme, due to an inherent inability to synthesize heme or protoporphyrin IX. Heme is the nonprotein component of hemoglobin that consists of the iron in the ferrous state (Fe2+) bound in the center of protoporphyrin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Interaction with erythrocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The entry of <em>Bartonella</em> into erythrocytes involves adhesion, deformation, and invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Flagella play a major role in the organism's search for potential host cells and may also assist in binding to erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Cell binding involves attachment to a red blood cell glycolipid receptor and the release of deformin, a compound that induces extensive indentations in erythrocyte membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Cell entry appears to involve several processes, including flagellum-induced entry into the invaginations created by deformin and a process not clearly elucidated that involves the invasion associated locus proteins A and B (known as IalA and IalB); these proteins are synthesized from the invasion-associated locus gene region known as ialAB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>The <em>Bartonella</em> organisms enter the cell either free within the cytosol or within a vacuole, and subsequently replicate primarily in the erythrocytic vacuole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Eventually, the organism can escape from the cell and, in some instances, causes cell lysis; the cell lysis correlates with the anemia frequently associated with clinical <em>B. bacilliformis</em> infection. Alcoholics may have more bacteria per erythrocyte than healthy blood donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Interaction with endothelial cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. quintana</em>, <em>B. henselae</em>, and <em>B. bacilliformis</em> all interact with endothelial cells and all can induce angiogenesis. <em>Bartonella</em> have outer membrane proteins, referred to as trimeric autotransporter adhesins, that play a central role in the adhesion to endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Infection of endothelial cells in vitro with <em>B. henselae</em> leads to activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), the key transcription factor involved in angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. HIF-1 subsequently triggers the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that leads to proliferation of endothelial cells.

The activation of HIF-1 depends on the expression of <em>Bartonella</em> adhesin A (formerly known as &quot;type IV pili&quot;), a very large protein that mediates binding of <em>B. henselae</em> to extracellular matrix proteins and to endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>In an in vitro model using human umbilical vein cells and extracellular matrix protein, <em>B. henselae</em> induced long-term endothelial survival and angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The organism produced more angiogenesis than did treatment with VEGF itself. These findings could explain how <em>B. henselae</em> causes vasoproliferative disorders, such as bacillary angiomatosis and peliosis hepatis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-bartonella-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Bartonella infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p><em>Bartonella</em> species appear to increase the production of NF kappa-beta by endothelial cells, a process that recruits monocytes and macrophages, thereby expanding the bacterial cell habitat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune response to <em>Bartonella</em> infections has become an active subject of investigation. The type and severity of the infection typically correlates with the host&rsquo;s immune function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. One study of the immune response to <em>B. henselae</em> infections in immunocompetent mice found infection with this organism induced a cell-mediated immune response with a Th1 phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In particular, after <em>B. henselae</em> was inoculated into the peritoneum of mice, the animals developed cellular proliferative responses, mainly from CD4 cells, that peaked eight weeks after infection.</p><p>In response to the infection, the animals increased production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, but not interleukin (IL)-4. In another study, investigators from Italy examined the interaction of <em>B. henselae</em> and macrophages in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Using a mouse macrophage cell line, they found entry of <em>B. henselae</em> into macrophages occurred within 30 minutes and peaked at approximately 160 minutes. Treating the cells with IFN-gamma significantly decreased the number of intracellular <em>B. henselae</em> and the IFN-gamma was associated with nitric oxide release. The investigators concluded that IFN-gamma activation of macrophages likely plays a major role in clearing <em>B. henselae</em> infection, and this microbial activity of IFN-gamma is mediated largely by nitric oxide production.</p><p><em>Bartonella</em> species evade the host immune response using multiple adaptive strategies. One study that involved humans found increased IL-10 production among homeless persons with <em>Bartonella</em> bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The overproduction of IL-10 correlated with an attenuated inflammatory response and, therefore, may play a role in persistent infection in homeless persons. The escape from the immune response is also thought to result from the prolonged antagonism of the host Toll-like 4 (TLR4) receptors by the <em>Bartonella</em> outer membrane lipooligosaccharides, an effect that blunts the normal host production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Further, the type IV secretion system proteins produced by <em>Bartonella</em> spp appear to play a significant role in erythrocyte binding and in subversion of multiple host endothelial cell functions that are critical for establishing chronic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-biology-of-bartonella-species/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207887592\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Bartonella </em>species are fastidious, gram-negative bacteria, which cause a range of manifestations including cat scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis and other infections in patients with HIV infection, as well as culture-negative endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three most important <em>Bartonella </em>spp known to cause human disease are <em>Bartonella bacilliformis</em>, <em>Bartonella quintana</em>, and <em>Bartonella henselae</em>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Bartonella</em> spp are gram-negative, pleomorphic bacteria that stain very poorly in tissues using Gram stain but will stain black with silver-impregnated stains, such as the Warthin-Starry stain. The organisms are slow growing and regardless of which special techniques are used, typically require at least seven days before growth can be detected. Routine culture procedures have low yield, unless the cultures are held for an extended period. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most <em>Bartonella</em> spp that cause human disease are associated with well-defined reservoirs, usually domestic and wild animals. Cats serve as the major reservoir for <em>B. henselae</em> human infections, but infrequently display clinical signs of <em>B. henselae</em> infection. Humans serve as the reservoir for <em>B. quintana</em> and <em>B. bacilliformis</em>. Vectors (fleas, lice, and sandflies) also play an important role in <em>Bartonella</em> infection in humans. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Natural reservoirs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of <em>Bartonella</em> infection in humans is not completely understood. Most existing data have focused on <em>Bartonella</em> infection of erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Flagella play a major role in the organism's search for potential host cells and may also assist in binding to erythrocytes. <em>B. quintana</em>, <em>B. henselae</em>, and <em>B. bacilliformis</em> all interact with endothelial cells and all can induce angiogenesis.
