Follicular occlusion may be a key pathogenic event in the development of DCS. DCS may occur in association with other follicular occlusive disorders such as acne conglobata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and pilonidal cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Data on treatment options for DCS are limited.

A classification scheme proposed by the participants of a 2001 workshop on cicatricial alopecia sponsored by the North American Hair Research Society further classified DCS as a neutrophilic form of primary cicatricial alopecia based upon pathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a> and <a href=\"#H192597718\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192597694\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DCS most commonly occurs in black males aged 20 to 40 years. However, DCS has also been reported in Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] and other racial or ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/1,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7</a>], as well as in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192597700\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of DCS is unknown. A defect in follicular keratinization leading to obstruction of the follicle is suspected to contribute to the development of DCS. This theory is supported by the observation that DCS occurs in association with other disorders of follicular occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H503059023\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Proposed pathogenic events in DCS are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sebaceous and keratinous material accumulates within dilated hair follicles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release of this material into the dermis triggers an intense neutrophilic inflammatory reaction followed by abscess and sinus tract formation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary bacterial infection can occur, leading to exacerbation of the disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192597706\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DCS usually manifests as boggy, suppurative nodules on the vertex and posterior scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91508%7EDERM%2F75929%7EDERM%2F103149%7EDERM%2F103150%7EDERM%2F103151\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91508 graphicRef75929 graphicRef103149 graphicRef103150 graphicRef103151 \">picture 1A-E</a>); however, other sections of the scalp can be affected. Drainage of pus or blood from involved skin is common. Because interconnecting sinuses are often present between nodules, the application of pressure to a nodule can result in drainage from a distant site. Patients often use head scarves, hats, or gauze dressings to hide these clinical manifestations.</p><p>Exudate from nodules of DCS is usually sterile; however, secondary infection can occur. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and anaerobic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] have been isolated from sites of DCS.</p><p>Hair loss in DCS is usually patchy and most prominent on the skin overlying nodules. Although hair loss can be reversible in early stages of disease, scarring alopecia can develop in persistent cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The clinical course of DCS is chronic. Patients frequently experience periodic flares of varying severity, depending on the degree of inflammation. Pain or pruritus may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. Hypertrophic or keloidal scarring may occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81039\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81039 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H503059023\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DCS is considered a component of the follicular occlusion tetrad, a group of four disorders (hidradenitis suppurativa, acne conglobata, DCS, and pilonidal sinus) thought to have follicular occlusion as a key pathogenic event. Patients with DCS may exhibit disorders in the follicular occlusion tetrad. Additional disorders, such as marginal keratitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, and sternoclavicular hyperostosis also have occurred in patients with DCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/1,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-18</a>].

Characteristic histologic findings of DCS are dense, predominantly neutrophilic, mixed-cell perifollicular infiltrates in the dermis. There may be abscesses in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Follicular dilatation may be evident in early disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>]. Granulomatous inflammation, scarring, and fibrosis are common in advanced or late-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192597724\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of DCS can usually be made clinically, although a culture should be performed to rule out secondary infection, and a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other forms of cicatricial alopecia if overlapping features are observed. In general, the diagnosis should be suspected in patients with a chronic, relapsing eruption characterized by multiple boggy, suppurative nodules on the scalp (see <a href=\"#H192597706\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above). Adult men of African ancestry represent the most common patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H503059433\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient history should include an assessment of the duration of hair loss and associated symptoms. Patients with DCS typically complain of chronic and recurrent scalp nodules associated with purulent or bloody drainage. Given the association of DCS with other disorders in the follicular occlusion tetrad, patients also should be asked about a history of signs or symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa, acne conglobata, or pilonidal cysts. Performance of a full skin examination is helpful for identifying patients with these diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H259635175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acne-vulgaris#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acne vulgaris&quot;, section on 'Acne conglobata'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilonidal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pilonidal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The physical examination of the hair and scalp should include an assessment of the distribution and extent of involvement. Boggy nodules, typically 1 to 3 cm in diameter, involving the posterior and vertex scalp are typical of DCS. Palpation of the scalp aids in the detection of the classic boggy texture. Drainage of pus or blood and patches of alopecia overlying nodules are common findings.</p><p>The physical examination may also help to assess for the likelihood of hair regrowth. A loss of follicular orifices suggests permanent, scarring alopecia. General principles for the clinical evaluation of patients with hair loss are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674146843\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoscopy may be a useful adjunctive procedure in the clinical assessment of patients with DCS. Common findings are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early disease:</strong> Empty follicular openings, yellow dots, and black dots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced disease:</strong> Yellow structureless areas and three-dimensional yellow dots imposed over dystrophic hair shafts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>End-stage disease:</strong> Confluent ivory-white areas without follicular openings</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H586652392\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the diagnosis of DCS is uncertain, a scalp biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate DCS from other cicatricial alopecias. A 4 mm punch biopsy is usually adequate. The recommended site for a biopsy is within a boggy, suppurative, or tender nodule; the goal is to sample a clinically active (ie, inflamed) lesion. Classically, histologic examination of DCS reveals a perifollicular neutrophil-predominant, mixed-cell inflammatory infiltrate. (See <a href=\"#H192597718\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p>Some dermatopathologists prefer to receive two scalp biopsy specimens to allow for examination of the tissue in both vertical and horizontal sections.

On examination, yellowish crusts or collarettes of scale at sites of ruptured pustules and tufted folliculitis (multiple hairs emerging from a single inflamed follicular orifice) are common findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91503 \">picture 3</a>). The deep-seated nodules characteristic of DCS are not a typical feature of folliculitis decalvans.

Patients with advanced disease may develop keloid-like plaques or nodules. Although scarring and keloids may occur as a consequence of DCS, fibrotic, keloid-like papules or plaques are not the primary clinical feature in DCS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-keloidalis-nuchae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acne keloidalis nuchae&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial folliculitis</strong> &ndash; Bacterial folliculitis is characterized by inflamed follicular papules or pustules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97630 \">picture 5</a>). Unlike DCS, large boggy nodules or abscesses are not typical features of folliculitis.

Occasionally, a pilar cyst may become inflamed or infected. The presence of multiple nodules that are boggy or suppurative helps to distinguish DCS from pilar cysts.

Multiple interventions have been used to achieve these goals; however, the ideal approach to treatment is unclear. Data on treatments are primarily limited to case reports and small series with limited follow-up, precluding conclusions on the relative efficacy of treatments. Our approach to the treatment of DCS is reviewed here. Other approaches may be reasonable.</p><p>Oral antibiotic therapy may have beneficial antiinflammatory and antibacterial effects and is our preferred first-line treatment for patients with mild to moderate DCS, given the favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Tetracyclines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, are commonly given. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>, a drug that targets follicular occlusion, is our preferred initial treatment for patients with severe DCS and patients with milder disease who do not respond well to oral antibiotics. Treatment with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin is often discontinued during periods of remission to minimize the duration of drug therapy. However, there is a high risk of relapse after treatment.</p><p>Occasionally, patients present with very painful or fluctuant nodules for which an immediate intervention is necessary for symptom relief. Adjunctive therapies, such as intralesional corticosteroid injection and incision and drainage are useful in this setting. However, these interventions do not alter the course of DCS and should not be used as primary treatments.</p><p>Limited data suggest that other medical interventions may be of benefit for DCS. Examples include oral zinc and biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Procedural therapies, such as laser hair removal, carbon dioxide laser ablation, and surgical excision, have also seemed beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192597744\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of disease influences our selection of initial treatment. While a severity scale for DCS is lacking, clinical severity can be assessed based upon a number of factors, including the number and size of lesions (eg, few to several or numerous), the amount of drainage (eg, slight or copious), and the extent of scarring (eg, localized or extensive).</p><p>Because secondary infection of DCS is possible, a bacterial culture should be performed prior to initiating treatment. If the culture identifies pathogenic bacteria, an antibiotic should be selected accordingly to treat the infection. The patient can then be transitioned to treatment directed at the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H674145014\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H674145030\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674145014\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild to moderate disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics (especially tetracyclines) are our preferred initial treatment for mild to moderate disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192597750\"><span class=\"h4\">Oral antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetracycline</a> derivatives, most notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, are widely used in the treatment of DCS. However, clinical trials evaluating antibiotic therapy are lacking and evidence is limited. In a retrospective study of 21 patients with DCS, four of five patients treated with doxycycline (mean daily dose of 100 mg per day) had a great reduction in disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>We frequently initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg twice daily for a period of three months.

If a partial but insufficient response occurs after three months, we often switch from doxycycline to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> for another three months. In our experience, some patients who have inadequate responses to doxycycline exhibit greater improvement with minocycline. Alternatively, the patient can be treated with an alternative antibiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/5,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23,24</a>] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]) or transition to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> therapy.

In a separate case series of four patients, treatment of DCS with oral isotretinoin 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for up to four months after a four-month course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> (300 mg twice daily) led to remissions lasting for up to one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a retrospective study, seven of eight patients treated with isotretinoin (mean daily dose of 30 mg) had a significant reduction in inflammatory activity.</p><p>The recommended dose range is 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Remission often occurs within three months in patients who respond to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Clinical experience suggests that treatment duration should be for at least four months after resolution or marked reduction of clinically active lesions. Relapse several weeks to months after discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> is common; however, in some patients, the severity of disease may be lower than prior to treatment.</p><p>Potential adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> include dry skin and mucous membranes, hypertriglyceridemia, elevation of liver transaminases, vision changes, and teratogenicity.

DCS most commonly affects men of African ancestry between the ages of 20 and 40; however, other individuals can develop DCS. (See <a href=\"#H192597694\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of DCS is unclear. The disease may result from a defect of follicular keratinization that leads to obstruction of hair follicles. DCS may occur in association with other follicular occlusive disorders. (See <a href=\"#H192597700\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H503059023\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with DCS typically develop multiple boggy, suppurative nodules on the vertex and posterior scalp with interconnecting sinus tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91508%7EDERM%2F75929%7EDERM%2F103149%7EDERM%2F103150%7EDERM%2F103151\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91508 graphicRef75929 graphicRef103149 graphicRef103150 graphicRef103151 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Purulent or bloody drainage is common. Hair loss is usually patchy. (See <a href=\"#H192597706\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of DCS usually can be made based upon the clinical evaluation. Scalp biopsies can be helpful for confirming DCS when the diagnosis is uncertain. A bacterial culture should be performed to rule out secondary infection. (See <a href=\"#H192597724\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on the treatment of DCS are limited and the ideal approach to treatment is unclear. We suggest oral antibiotic therapy for initial therapy for patients with mild to moderate disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> for initial therapy for patients with severe disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Intralesional corticosteroid injection and incision and drainage are useful adjunctive therapies for achieving rapid symptom relief.
