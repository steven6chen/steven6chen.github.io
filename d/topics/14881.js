Although most patients with cutaneous SCC present with localized disease that is cured with local treatment, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and death related to this disease occasionally occur. &quot;High-risk&quot; cutaneous SCCs are tumors that exhibit clinical or histologic features that have been associated with increased risk for aggressive tumor behavior. The best approach to the management of high-risk cutaneous SCC is not definitively known. Mohs micrographic surgery, surgical excision with complete tissue margin assessment, and radiation therapy are commonly used in the management of these lesions.</p><p>The clinical and pathologic features of high-risk cutaneous SCC and the management of patients with these tumors will be reviewed here. The risk factors and diagnosis of cutaneous SCC, the treatment of low-risk cutaneous SCC, and systemic therapy for advanced cutaneous SCC are reviewed separately.

Cutaneous SCC may occur in individuals of all races and ethnicities, but most frequently occurs in people with light skin who sunburn easily. Highly-curable, localized cutaneous SCC occurs most frequently; locoregional or distant metastases develop in less than 1 percent to 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. However, it has been estimated that deaths from cutaneous SCC are as common in the central and southern United States as deaths from many other common cancers including melanoma, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal cancer, and bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Although the literature supports a correlation between certain clinical and pathologic features of cutaneous SCC with increased risk for tumor recurrence and metastasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72651 \">table 1</a>), a lack of consensus over the definition of high-risk cutaneous SCC, a paucity of high-quality therapeutic studies, and the absence of a prognostic model that integrates multiple risk factors have made the prediction of patient outcomes and the formation of definitive management guidelines challenging. As an example, a survey-based study of 117 Mohs surgeons found a lack of consistency in the approach to the evaluation and management of high-risk SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90084722\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH-RISK FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of clinical and histopathologic factors have been proposed as indicators of increased risk for recurrence or metastasis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, as noted above, a consensus on which features define high-risk cutaneous SCC has not been established; major entities such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) describe dissimilar &quot;high-risk&quot; criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83683%7EONC%2F110946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83683 graphicRef110946 \">table 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>]. In a retrospective study of 269 tumors, considerable discordance was observed between AJCC and NCCN definitions of high-risk cutaneous SCC. A small proportion of tumors were considered high-risk under the 2010 AJCC staging guidelines (14 percent), while a majority of tumors were considered high-risk under the NCCN guidelines (87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Examples of factors that have been associated with increased risk for metastasis or death on multivariate analysis in cohort studies include: clinical tumor diameter 2 cm or greater, depth of invasion &gt;6 mm or beyond the subcutaneous fat, poor differentiation, perineural invasion (PNI), location on the ear, and immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11-13</a>]. These may be the most significant drivers of poor outcomes in SCC. However, all major characteristics that have been associated with aggressive tumor behavior are reviewed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72651 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90084731\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical findings that have been used to identify high-risk cutaneous SCC include tumor location, tumor size, tumor status as primary or recurrent, and the presence of neurologic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90084740\"><span class=\"h3\">Anatomic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain tumor locations have been linked to increased risk for aggressive tumor behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Local recurrence of cutaneous SCC is estimated to occur in 2 to 22 percent of lip tumors and 5 to 19 percent of ear tumors, and metastasis develops in 3 to 20 percent and 9 to 12 percent of these lesions, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The relatively thin nature of auricular skin and the low depth of invasion required for the tumor to invade the perichondrium (approximately 2 mm) may contribute to the increased risk for local recurrence observed with tumors on the ear. In addition, the proximity of the ear to the lymph nodes of the parotid gland and neck may be an important factor for metastasis. A retrospective cohort study of 353 patients with cutaneous SCC of the ear found that 10.5 percent developed nodal metastasis and the five-year disease-specific survival in patients with nodal metastasis was significantly lower as compared with those without nodal metastasis (59 percent versus 99 percent ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Tumors on the cheek also may portend an increased risk for metastasis compared to tumors in some other sites; a retrospective study of approximately 9000 cases of primary cutaneous SCC found that tumors on the auricular area, lip, and cheek were more likely to metastasize than tumors on the lower leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90084747\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor diameter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from multiple studies suggest that tumors 2 cm or larger in diameter are more likely to behave aggressively than smaller tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4-6,16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,16-21</a>]. A 1992 review found local recurrence rates for tumors &ge;2 cm and &lt;2 cm of 15 and 7 percent, respectively, and rates of metastasis of 30 versus 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The findings of this review are corroborated by a retrospective study in which 25 of 200 cutaneous SCCs (12.5 percent) metastasized; skin tumors that metastasized were more likely than non-metastatic tumors to be larger than 2 cm (68 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The AJCC staging system for cutaneous SCC designates a tumor size &gt;2 cm as important for disease staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110946 \">table 2B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Tumors that reach this threshold are automatically upstaged from T1 to T2. However, the possibility that smaller lesions may metastasize should always be considered, particularly for lesions on the head and neck. In a prospective study of 266 patients with cutaneous SCC that metastasized to parotid or cervical lymph nodes, 70 percent of lesions measured &le;2 cm, indicating that factors other than tumor size likely contribute to metastatic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In concordance, lower size thresholds for identifying tumors on the head and neck as high-risk lesions have been proposed by some authors. The NCCN guidelines provide the following stratified approach for defining high-risk SCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83683 \">table 2A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;2 cm on the trunk or extremities (excluding pretibia, hands, feet, nail units, and ankles)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;1 cm on the cheeks, forehead, scalp, neck, or pretibia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;0.6 cm on the &quot;mask&quot; areas of the face (central face, eyelids, eyebrows, periorbital skin, nose, cutaneous or vermillion lip, chin, mandible, preauricular and postauricular skin, temple, and ear), genitalia, hands, and feet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90084754\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with tumors that recur locally after initial treatment are associated with an increased risk for the development of distant metastatic disease.

SCCs that arise in sites of prior radiation therapy may also be more likely to behave aggressively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72651 \">table 1</a>).

A review of 12 studies, including 241 cutaneous SCC patients with clinical and 381 with subclinical PNI, found no significant difference in the overall risk of nodal and distant metastasis by PNI classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, patients with clinical PNI had a higher risk of local recurrence and death from SCC, compared with patients with subclinical PNI (37 versus 17 percent, and 27 versus 6 percent, respectively).

As an example, a retrospective study of 136 patients with invasive cutaneous SCC on the trunk or extremity treated at a tertiary care center between 1994 and 2004 found that poorly differentiated tumors were three times more likely than well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated tumors to result in metastasis or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Whereas none of 325 tumors less than 2 mm thick metastasized during a follow-up period of up to 36 months after surgery, 9 of 60 tumors with depths greater than 6 mm (15 percent) metastasized.

The local recurrence rate for tumors that exhibit this feature is estimated to be 16 to 47 percent and metastasis is estimated to occur in 10 to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/14,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,30</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The caliber of the involved nerves in patients with PNI may provide additional prognostic information. Tumors with PNI of large nerves may portend a worse prognosis than tumors with smaller nerve involvement. The findings of a retrospective cohort study of 48 patients with cutaneous SCC and PNI (mean follow-up time = three years) support this concept; 8 of 25 patients (32 percent) with PNI involving nerves that were at least 0.1 mm in diameter died from cutaneous SCC versus 0 of 23 patients with PNI limited to smaller nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although a separate retrospective study that included 62 patients with cutaneous SCC and PNI who had the involved nerve diameter assessed failed to find a statistically significant impact of nerve diameter on prognosis, the study was limited to patients who were treated with both surgery and radiation, many of whom had positive surgical margins prior to radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, patients in this study may have had an increased likelihood for poor prognosis compared with the general population of patients with PNI.</p><p>Tumors with PNI often have other high-risk features that may impact prognosis. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 114 cases of cutaneous SCC with PNI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although the study found worse prognoses in patients with cutaneous SCC with PNI of large nerves (&ge;0.1 mm diameter) than in patients with PNI of smaller nerves (&lt;0.1 mm diameter) on univariate analysis, nerve caliber did not predict outcomes on multivariate analysis since many subjects had other prognostic risk factors, regardless of nerve caliber. This underscores the need for larger studies to clarify the risk associated with each risk factor since factors are often co-linear with multiple factors occurring together in a given patient or tumor. Patients who had small caliber nerve invasion but had no other risk factors did very well (0 percent risk of nodal metastasis and 0 percent risk of death from SCC) indicating that PNI invasion alone may not necessarily confer a poor prognosis if it is not extensive.

A 2009 systematic review that identified 91 patients treated with surgery and ART and 2358 patients treated with surgery alone found high cure rates among cases in which documentation specified the attainment of clear margins, but failed to find sufficient data to indicate which patients benefit from ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Differences in local recurrence and disease specific death rates were not detected between the two groups. Moreover, among patients with PNI, statistically significant differences in patient outcomes were not detected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, definitive recommendations on the indications for ART are lacking. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommend the use of ART for tumors that exhibit extensive perineural or large-nerve involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,84</a>], and there is general agreement among clinicians that patients with PNI of large named nerves, lymph node involvement, massive local extension, or intracranial invasion are appropriate candidates for post-surgical ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/83,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,85</a>].

A small proportion of patients develop aggressive disease characterized by local recurrence or regional or distant metastases. (See <a href=\"#H858903\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple clinical and pathologic features have been labeled as indicators of increased risk for aggressive tumor behavior. Tumor location, tumor size, tumor status as primary or recurrent, and associated symptoms should be assessed during the clinical evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H90084731\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several pathologic features portend an increased likelihood for aggressive tumor behavior. Tumors that are not well-differentiated, tumors with desmoplastic growth patterns, thick tumors, and tumors with perineural invasion are considered high-risk lesions. (See <a href=\"#H90084761\" class=\"local\">'Histologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with high-risk cutaneous SCC begins with an assessment of the extent of disease based upon clinical, pathologic, and radiologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110946 \">table 2B</a>). The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in high-risk cutaneous SCC is uncertain, but the procedure may be underutilized in high-risk SCC.

In accordance with NCCN guidelines, we suggest the use of ART in patients with tumors that exhibit extensive perineural or large-nerve involvement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also consider ART for patients with cutaneous SCC with multiple risk factors, particularly those with highly infiltrative growth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor differentiation in which surgical margins are uncertain. Radiation therapy may also be used as a primary therapy for patients who are not candidates for surgery.

The frequency of follow-up is dependent upon the extent of disease. A full skin examination, palpation of regional lymph nodes, and evaluation for neurologic symptoms should be performed at every follow-up visit.
