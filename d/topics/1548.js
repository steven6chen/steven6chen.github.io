Patients should also be informed that although some response may occur within the first two weeks of treatment, it may take many weeks (eg, 8 to 14) for a full response (severity of illness and co-morbid disease may affect how quickly depressed patients respond to treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-antidepressants-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20533497\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical tests and plasma levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific medical tests are required before starting atypical antidepressants.

However, levels can assess adherence and whether unresponsive patients are rapid metabolizers. Levels can also establish that it is safe to begin another serotonergic drug (eg, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) after discontinuing an antidepressant that has serotonergic properties (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>), in order to avoid the serotonin syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64604 \">table 1</a>).

Depressed patients with comorbid anxiety disorders may tolerate the medication better by starting with half of the suggested dose. Doses are adjusted according to patient response, tolerability, and clinical urgency. </p><p>Finding the effective dose of an antidepressant involves trial and error. After starting the drug and titrating up to the minimum effective dose, response should be monitored over the next two to four weeks. For patients who tolerate the antidepressant but do not respond, we continue titrating up the dose slowly (to avoid side effects) every two to four weeks. For unresponsive patients who do not tolerate the drug, we suggest switching to a different antidepressant.

Agomelatine acts as an agonist at melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) that are thought to provide beneficial effects upon sleep disturbances by helping to restore normal circadian rhythms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-antidepressants-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; patients with insomnia may thus prefer agomelatine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-antidepressants-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The drug also antagonizes the serotonergic 5-HT2C receptor, which in turn enhances release of dopamine and norepinephrine. Agomelatine has no effect upon extracellular serotonin levels or monoamine uptake, and has no affinity for adrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-antidepressants-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10</a>].</p><p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of agomelatine are displayed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F88061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88061 \">table 3</a>). Agomelatine is metabolized in the liver primarily by the P450 enzyme CYP1A2, and is contraindicated in patients taking medications that potently inhibit the enzyme. As an example, co-administration with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a> has been demonstrated in vivo to raise agomelatine serum concentrations 60-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-antidepressants-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].
