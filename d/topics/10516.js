COPD is the fourth leading cause of death among adults worldwide and is expected to become the third leading cause of death by 2020 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>].</p><p>In the majority of patients with COPD, symptoms and exacerbations can be controlled with interventions such as smoking cessation, vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal infections, pulmonary rehabilitation, and one or more inhaled medications (eg, bronchodilators and glucocorticoids). In a minority of patients, COPD symptoms and exacerbations are persistent despite these interventions. While refractory COPD has not been defined, the context for this diagnostic category is patients with severe, persistent symptoms or high risk for exacerbations in spite of appropriate care, or advanced disease. </p><p>The management of refractory COPD will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and COPD exacerbations are discussed separately.

In addition to dyspnea, cough, sputum production, wheezing, and chest tightness, patients with severe and very severe COPD often report fatigue, weight loss, sleep disturbance, and anorexia.</p><p>When evaluating such patients, one of the first steps is to confirm proper technique and adherence to prescribed inhalers. (See <a href=\"#H2771421326\" class=\"local\">'Adherence'</a> below and <a href=\"#H139088169\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below.) </p><p>We also re-evaluate pulmonary function tests and often obtain a chest radiograph. The second two steps help determine whether the degree of airflow limitation has worsened or a new abnormality has developed (eg, impaired gas transfer, pleural effusion, interstitial lung disease). </p><p>For patients with worsening gas transfer, particularly if it seems out of proportion to the degree of airflow limitation, we often obtain an echocardiogram with Doppler to assess for pulmonary hypertension and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to assess the extent and distribution of emphysema and determine whether a new process (eg, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer) has developed.</p><p>When managing patients with refractory disease, we assess for exercise-related oxygen desaturation using pulse oximetry during ambulation. While supplemental oxygen has not been demonstrated to reduce symptoms or enhance function, individual patients may benefit symptomatically.

Evaluating for conditions often may reveal additional therapeutic options. We typically obtain an echocardiogram and, depending on the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and history, may obtain a pharmacologic stress test.

While patients are usually very familiar with pMDIs as they have used them as rescue inhalers, they may have problems with pMDI delivery, especially with hand-breath coordination.</p><p>DPIs have the advantage of being breath actuated and thus less subject to problems with actuation-inhalation coordination. On the other hand, DPIs require a threshold inspiratory flow, which patients with advanced COPD may be unable to generate.

Roflumilast may further reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations when added to other respiratory medications that have also been shown to reduce exacerbations (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">LABA/inhaled</span> glucocorticoid combination, LAMA), although the added benefit appears modest. In practice, roflumilast use has generally been limited to COPD patients with continued exacerbations despite maximally tolerated inhaled therapies. </p><p>Initiating treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=roflumilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">roflumilast</a> 250 mcg once daily for four weeks and then increasing to 500 mcg once daily may reduce the rate of treatment discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

NAC also have antioxidant effects. For patients with bothersome sputum production that is refractory to smoking cessation, routine therapies for COPD, and a course of antibiotics (when indicated), an oral thiol preparation (eg, N-acetyl cysteine [NAC], 600 mg twice daily) can be initiated on a trial basis and continued if there is symptomatic improvement. This suggestion is based on a large multicenter trial (PANTHEON) of 964 patients with moderate to severe COPD (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 49 percent of predicted) that found a reduction in exacerbations with NAC (600 mg tablets twice daily) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Furthermore, other studies of oral NAC as <span class=\"nowrap\">mucolytic/antioxidant</span> therapy for COPD have yielded conflicting results and a systematic review concluded that evidence was insufficient to recommend this agent in COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H891696055\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a minority of patients with COPD, symptoms and exacerbations are persistent despite therapy with a long-acting muscarinic agent (LAMA, also known as a long-acting anticholinergic agent), a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), and inhaled glucocorticoid. (See <a href=\"#H891696055\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When evaluating such patients, the first steps include confirming smoking cessation, proper inhaler technique, and adherence to prescribed inhalers, assessing severity of airflow limitation with pulmonary function testing, and obtaining a chest radiograph. Depending on the results, further evaluation may include Doppler echocardiogram <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high resolution computed tomography. (See <a href=\"#H1102762732\" class=\"local\">'Reassess COPD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of common comorbidities of COPD can contribute to dyspnea and exercise intolerance, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, metabolic syndrome, lung cancer, skeletal muscle dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. Evaluating for comorbid conditions (eg, echocardiogram, pharmacologic stress test) may reveal additional therapeutic options. (See <a href=\"#H2018953148\" class=\"local\">'Assess for complicating diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have persistent symptoms despite triple inhaler therapy (LAMA, LABA, inhaled glucocorticoid), it is worth reviewing their adherence to therapy and inhaler technique. (See <a href=\"#H1903559686\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing triple inhaler therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with refractory dyspnea will experience improved exercise tolerance with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>. The exact mechanism is unclear. Caution is advised as it has more side effects than inhaled bronchodilators and a number of medication interactions. (See <a href=\"#H3475079922\" class=\"local\">'Theophylline'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with recurrent exacerbations (eg, at least two per year or one requiring hospitalization) despite triple inhalers, the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=roflumilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">roflumilast</a> or chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> may reduce the frequency of exacerbations. The choice between these medications is largely based on anticipated adverse effects as they have not been directly compared. (See <a href=\"#H2422674056\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=roflumilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Roflumilast</a> should be avoided in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C) or a history of moderate or severe depression. Potential medication interactions should be assessed. (See <a href=\"#H4124783955\" class=\"local\">'Phosphodiesterase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azithromycin</a> can be given as 250 mg daily or at a lower dose of 250 to 500 mg three times per week. We often use 250 mg three times per week to reduce adverse effects. Azithromycin should be avoided in patients with a long QT interval or if there are major concerns about hearing loss. (See <a href=\"#H1584268986\" class=\"local\">'Chronic antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who continue to have significant symptoms despite the above interventions may be considered for surgical therapy.
