New pets can pose more of a health risk. Adult pets are generally safer than younger animals, since they are less likely to be involved in playful activities that include scratching and biting.

However, a declining horse population, equine vaccination, and improved vector control have reduced the incidence of the disease. Infection of avian species results in a viremia of sufficient magnitude and frequency to maintain a reservoir of infected mosquitoes.

Effective prevention of both human and equine disease can be accomplished by immunizing equines. Mosquitoes are required as a vector for human transmission. VEE has a widespread geographic distribution from Florida to South America.</p><p>Human disease occurs after an incubation period of one to six days, and is heralded by a brief febrile illness of sudden onset, accompanied by malaise, nausea or vomiting, headache, and myalgia.
