Thrombocytopenia is often asymptomatic and may present as an incidental finding during routine evaluation or during laboratory investigations performed for other reasons. A common cause of thrombocytopenia in children is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP, previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), for which the consensus definition is more restrictive, requiring a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Our approach to the evaluation of thrombocytopenia in children will be reviewed here.

This is because circulating platelets fulfill many critical hemostatic functions, including adhesion to sites of vascular injury, secretion of mediators of hemostasis, and aggregation via fibrinogen binding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81908\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81908 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-biology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet biology&quot;, section on 'Overview of platelet function'</a>.)</p><p>The normal platelet count for children ranges from 150,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">450,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In general, the risk of bleeding does not increase until the platelet count falls significantly below <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span>. For example, surgical bleeding solely due to a decreased platelet count typically does not occur until the platelet count is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL,</span> and spontaneous bleeding typically does not occur until the platelet count is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL</span>.</p><p>The circulation time for platelets is about 8 to 10 days, after which they are removed from the circulation by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. Younger circulating platelets are larger and more hemostatically active. For example, at a platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL,</span> patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which is due to an immune-mediated destruction of platelets in the setting of a healthy bone marrow, have younger circulating platelets and, consequently, less severe bleeding symptoms than patients with a similar degree of thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow failure from leukemia, whose platelets tend to be older and less active. Thus for a given platelet count, bleeding risk will be greater in patients with thrombocytopenia due to impaired platelet production as a result of an older circulating population of platelets. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Reticulated platelets'</a> below.)</p><p>When thrombocytopenia is recognized or suspected, implementing reasonable precautions to minimize bleeding risk is recommended. These include trauma precautions (eg, avoidance of contact sports and use of helmet while cycling) and avoidance of drugs that impair platelet function (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BLEEDING SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many children with mild or moderate thrombocytopenia may be asymptomatic, and thrombocytopenia may be first detected on a complete blood count obtained for another reason. Patients with symptomatic thrombocytopenia generally present with cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucosal bleeding (eg, easy bruising, petechiae, gingival bleeding, epistaxis). Some affected children may have persistent, profuse bleeding from superficial cuts. In post-menarcheal females, thrombocytopenia may present as menorrhagia (excess menstrual flow) and metrorrhagia (uterine bleeding between periods). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-evaluation-and-approach-to-diagnosis#H2710291910\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Evaluation and approach to diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Excessive menstrual bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>The pattern of bleeding differs between patients with thrombocytopenia and those with disorders of coagulation factors, such as hemophilia. Patients with thrombocytopenia are more likely to have bleeding after minor cuts, and less likely to have deep bleeding into tissues, muscles and joints, or to have delayed bleeding. In patients with thrombocytopenia, posttraumatic or postoperative surgical bleeding usually responds to local measures but may persist for hours or days after small injuries. In addition, patients with coagulation disorders tend not to have petechiae, which are characteristic of platelet defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous bleeding is usually manifested as petechiae or superficial ecchymoses. These cutaneous manifestations are sometimes known as &quot;dry purpura.&quot; Petechiae are pinhead-sized, red, flat, discrete lesions attributable to red cells, which have extravasated from capillaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73905 \">picture 1</a>). They often occur in crops in dependent areas, are nontender, and do not blanch under pressure. Petechiae that are confluent form a type of purpura that is <strong>not palpable</strong> (in contrast to the palpable purpura seen in vasculitic disorders). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasculitis in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ecchymoses are non-tender areas of bleeding into the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59402\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59402 \">picture 2</a>). The affected area of the skin is usually associated with multiple colors due to the presence of extravasated blood (red, purple) and breakdown of heme pigment by skin macrophages (green, orange, yellow). Ecchymotic lesions in patients with thrombocytopenia are usually small, multiple, superficial, and can develop without noticeable trauma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29097110\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucosal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucosal bleeding is usually manifested as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and bullous hemorrhage on the buccal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71480 \">picture 3</a>), but also may include gastrointestinal and genitourinary bleeding. Mucosal bleeding is sometimes known as &quot;wet purpura&quot;. Thrombocytopenic patients with mucosal bleeding usually have cutaneous bleeding as well. Although not rigorously validated, the presence of wet purpura is widely perceived as the more serious of the two findings and a risk factor for potentially life-threatening hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a rare but serious consequence of thrombocytopenia, and the most common cause of death in affected patients. When ICH occurs, it is often preceded by a history of head trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4714305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Intracranial hemorrhage'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial step in the evaluation of suspected thrombocytopenia in children is verification of a low platelet count. Once thrombocytopenia has been confirmed, the evaluation is focused on determining the underlying etiology, so that directed therapeutic measures can be implemented. The evaluation includes a detailed history, complete physical examination, and laboratory testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Verification of thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial step in the evaluation of suspected thrombocytopenia in children is verification of a low platelet count. In particular, a platelet count that is inconsistent with the clinical presentation of the patient (such as a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL</span> in a patient with no petechiae or other abnormalities) should be confirmed before extensive evaluation is undertaken, to ensure that the low platelet count is not due to artifact or laboratory error. This can be accomplished through a repeat of the platelet count, or, as is preferable, review of the peripheral blood smear by a qualified observer. </p><p>Spurious thrombocytopenia can be caused by improper collection or inadequate anticoagulation of the blood sample, resulting in platelet clumps that are counted as leukocytes by automated cell counters. In addition, agglutination of platelets by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-dependent antibodies, which are normally present in 0.1 percent of adults, may cause a falsely low platelet count (also referred to as pseudothrombocytopenia). EDTA exposes a normally concealed epitope on the platelet membrane, glycoprotein (GP) <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa,</span> which interacts with these antibodies resulting in platelet clumping. Examination of the blood smear will demonstrate large clumps of agglutinated platelets or adherent platelets surrounding neutrophils. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should document the timing and severity of present and past bleeding symptoms.

The duration and onset of any bleeding symptoms may help to determine whether the thrombocytopenia is acquired or congenital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic symptoms &ndash; Systemic symptoms (fever, bone pain, weight loss, and decreased energy) may suggest a systemic disease, such as malignancy or autoimmune disorder (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]).

This disorder is caused by an enteric pathogen that produces Shiga toxin. HUS is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal injury, usually developing 5 to 10 days after the onset of diarrhea.

A family history of leukemia or thrombocytopenia could signal a familial predisposition to the former, highlighting the importance of identifying such cases for purposes of surveillance and genetic counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Bleeding into the skin is one of the most common findings in patients with thrombocytopenia, and may include petechiae, non-palpable purpura, and ecchymoses (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous bleeding'</a> above). Sites of bleeding should be noted, especially dependent parts of the body, and a marking pen may be used to outline areas of bleeding or demarcate involved and uninvolved skin areas. Serial examinations can monitor the patient's clinical course by noting changes in the number of petechiae or bleeding pattern within involved areas. In hospitalized patients, careful examination for bleeding should be performed at the sites of indwelling catheters, drains and incisions, areas of previous trauma, and exit sites of venous access devices. The gingival and oral cavity should be examined carefully for evidence of bleeding.</p><p>Other components of the physical exam that may provide clues to the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth parameters &ndash; Short stature is a common finding in inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.
