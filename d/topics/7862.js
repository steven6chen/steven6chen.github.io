The author concluded that grand multiparity was dangerous because, in his study, maternal mortality increased steadily from the 5<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup> pregnancy. This topic will discuss issues related to grand multiparity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122650247\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A reasonable definition of grand multiparity is &ge;5 live births and stillbirths &ge;20 weeks of gestation, with great grand multiparity defined as &ge;10 live births and stillbirths &ge;20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, other definitions are also used. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Variability in the definition of parity'</a> below.)</p><p>Pregnancy losses under 20 weeks of gestation are considered abortions. Abortions are not counted toward parity, but are counted toward gravidity (ie, the number of times a woman has been pregnant, including her current pregnancy). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122650227\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States in 2014, 2.8 percent of live births were the fifth child in the family, 1.7 percent were the sixth or seventh child, and 0.5 percent were the eighth child and over [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Africa has the highest rate of grand multiparity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS AFFECTING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARITY AND PREGNANCY OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between obstetric complications and parity has been studied extensively, with inconsistent findings. In addition to the usual limitations of observational data, there are several reasons for the discordancy:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Variability in the definition of parity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are discrepancies in the way clinicians define parity. A study that evaluated the definition of parity among obstetricians and midwives in London noted that 62 percent defined parity as pregnancies &ge;24 weeks of gestation irrespective of outcome, 25 percent defined parity as pregnancies &ge;24 weeks ending in live birth, and 13 percent defined parity by the number of pregnancies irrespective of outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Only 21 percent of those surveyed described twin pregnancies as a single parous experience.</p><p>In addition, there is a discrepancy between the clinical definition of parity and the definition used by the United States National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), an organization within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The NCHS defines parity as the number of prior live births, excluding stillbirths and fetal deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], while most clinical investigators in the United States have defined parity as the number of births (live births and stillbirths) &ge;20 weeks of gestation. Other gestational age cut-offs to define a parous event (eg, birth after 28 weeks of gestation) are used in other parts of the world.</p><p>Finally, investigators have variably defined grand multiparity as a parity of four, five, six, seven, or eight. Thus, one study may report outcomes for women para &ge;6 compared with those &lt;6, while another reports outcomes for women para &ge;5 compared with those &lt;5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Variability in the definition of controls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have compared grand multiparas to different referent groups, including women of parity 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], 1 to 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], 2 to 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], 2 to 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>], 1 to 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], 1 to 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], 2 to 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and the general obstetrical population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This makes it difficult to compare findings among studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonlinear relationship between parity and pregnancy outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between parity and birth outcome is not linear. In a cross-sectional analysis of births to women of parity 0 to 8 in Australia between 1992 and 1997, multivariate analysis showed that the risk of pregnancy complications was highest in nulliparas, lowest in multiparas who had one to three deliveries, and intermediate in multiparas with four or more deliveries (for any obstetric complication: nulliparas OR 1.75, Para 1 to 3 OR 0.96-1.03, Para 4 to 8 OR 1.19-1.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These findings suggest that the risk in obstetric complications associated with parity is bimodal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate adjustment for maternal age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the complications that have been associated with grand multiparity have also been independently associated with advanced maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Increasing maternal age is associated with increasing prevalence of comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, which also increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Thus, maternal age is an important confounder that must be accounted for to minimize bias in interpretation of results.</p><p>The importance of maternal age was illustrated in a retrospective cohort study that examined the birth outcomes of 4937 young (under 35 years of age) grand multiparas (parity &ge;5) and over 83,000 young primiparas in Utah [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Young grand multiparas were at significantly lower risk for &quot;any intrapartum complication&quot; (eg, placental abruption, placenta previa, intrapartum vaginal bleeding, umbilical cord prolapse, fetal distress, malpresentation, surgical delivery, instrumented delivery) compared with young primiparas. In addition, young grand multiparas were at significantly lower risk for any intrapartum complication when compared with older grand multiparas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Healthy person effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have had obstetrical complications in their first few pregnancies may be more likely to end childbearing before becoming grand multiparas compared with women who had uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. Thus, grand multiparas may represent a healthier group than women of lower parity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multivariate analysis of parity and pregnancy outcome reported a significantly increased risk of &quot;any obstetric complication&quot; among women of parity 4, 5, 6, and 7 to 8 when compared with primiparas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The obstetric complications included antepartum hemorrhage, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, premature rupture of membranes, threatened premature labor, postpartum hemorrhage, and third-degree lacerations.

Large observational studies have consistently shown that women who undergo multiple repeat cesarean deliveries are at increased risk of maternal morbidity, and the risk increases with the number of cesarean deliveries. The largest prospective study of maternal morbidity associated with multiple cesarean deliveries included 6201 first; 15,808 second; 6324 third; 1452 fourth; 258 fifth; and 89 sixth cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The odds of placenta previa and accreta progressively increased with the number of cesarean deliveries, and women with placenta previa were at very high risk of also having placenta accreta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80662 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51302 \">table 2</a>). The risk of peripartum hysterectomy at the fourth cesarean delivery was 1 in 40, increasing to 1 in 11 at the sixth cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repeat-cesarean-delivery#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repeat cesarean delivery&quot;, section on 'Is there an unsafe number of repeat cesarean deliveries?'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of uterine rupture may be increased in grand multiparity, and is known to be increased in any woman undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;</a>). A retrospective study reported the rate of uterine rupture during a trial of labor after a single previous cesarean was no higher than the background risk associated with TOLAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The authors identified 6 uterine ruptures among 1922 TOLACs (0.3 percent) in women with &ge;6 births and 1 previous cesarean. Other smaller series have reported mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. It is difficult to determine the true risk of uterine rupture in these studies because of the low rate of this complication and differences in study methods and terminology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H672025224\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM RISKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term maternal effects of grand multiparity are not well established. There is convincing evidence that the risk of pelvic organ prolapse increases with increasing parity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. As an example, in the Oxford Family Planning study, a prospective cohort study of more than 17,000 women followed for 17 years, the risk of hospital admission for pelvic organ prolapse increased markedly after the first and second births compared with nulliparity (four-fold and eight-fold increase, respectively), but increased less rapidly for subsequent births (nine-fold increase after the third birth; 10-fold increase after the fourth birth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Among parous women, 75 percent of prolapse cases can be attributed to pregnancy and childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Specific factors, such as forceps delivery, may be particularly important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Women with pelvic organ prolapse may present with symptoms related specifically to the prolapsed structures, such as a bulge or vaginal pressure, or with associated symptoms, including urinary, defecatory or sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The prevalence of diastasis recti increases with increasing parity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectus-abdominis-diastasis#H116789987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectus abdominis diastasis&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>).

It has also been associated with an increased risk of some cancers, such as the <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/biliary</span> tract, but data are less consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grand-multiparity/abstract/57,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,65-67</a>]. These findings require further investigation to better understand confounding factors, such as age, obesity, smoking, and duration of breastfeeding.
