Radiosynovectomy is preferred in patients with inhibitors, advanced HIV infection, hepatitis, or multiple joint involvement. A 1992 study of knee synovectomy in 11 patients (eight open, five arthroscopic) showed a reduction in recurrent hemarthroses at an average follow-up of two and eight years for the arthroscopic and open groups, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients generally had slower disease progression following synovectomy. For radioactive procedures, several radioisotope-colloid complexes have been used. Comprehensive reviews of radiosynovectomy using different radioisotopes have found the procedure to be well-tolerated and associated with a reduced frequency of bleeding, and have provided protocols and advice regarding specific radioisotopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A complication associated with synovectomy is decreased range of motion, an important issue in the young child who cannot fully cooperate with a program of physical therapy.

Arthroplasty produced clinical and functional improvement with a reduction in the burden of disease to levels similar to those of patients with osteoarthritis undergoing hip arthroplasty. Functional ability did not reach normal levels because of residual symptoms and impairment of other joints. In a 2015 series that focused on the longevity of the 88 prosthetic knees in 74 people with hemophilia who underwent total knee arthroplasty over a 13-year period, the prosthetic remained in place in 81 cases (92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Another complication of joint disease and the associated decline in physical activity is the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

This is especially true for central nervous system bleeding, which can lead to chronic neurocognitive, educational, and behavioral deficits. This was demonstrated in a 2012 study that compared academic and behavioral outcomes in 16 boys with hemophilia who had a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) versus 16 controls who were matched for age, type of hemophilia (A or B), disease severity, and maternal education level; all were HIV negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Compared with controls, boys with a history of intracerebral bleeding had mildly reduced functioning in some but not all domains. There were reductions in intellectual functioning, vocabulary, and fine motor control. Scores were similar to controls for socio-emotional function, executive functioning, and socialization. Further study in this area and in interventions to support these individuals is needed.</p><p>Individuals who experience an intracerebral hemorrhage should undergo neuropsychiatric evaluation. In addition, all individuals with neurocognitive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral dysfunction should be offered age-appropriate educational resources and other supports. A general review of such resources is presented separately.

For patients who require dialysis, options include peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis without heparin in the extracorporeal circuit, hemodialysis with factor replacement, and renal transplantation.

In resource-rich settings, life expectancy has become similar to that of the general population. This is illustrated in the following large series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2007 study from the United Kingdom that followed 6018 people with hemophilia without HIV infection, median life expectancy was 63 years for those with severe disease and 75 years for those with mild to moderate disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Bleeding deaths were increased relative to the general population; cardiovascular deaths were decreased relative to population controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2006 study from the Netherlands that followed 967 people with hemophilia from 1992 to 2001, life expectancy was approximately 63 to 67 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The main causes of death were AIDS and HCV infection. When viral deaths were excluded, life expectancy was 72 years. Cancer-related deaths were almost twice as common as cardiovascular causes. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all patients was 2.3; higher SMR correlated with severity of factor deficiency (5.1, 2.6, and 1.3 for severe, moderate, and mild disease, respectively). SMR was lower for HIV-negative individuals and was unaffected by the type of hemophilia (A or B).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2000 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments in the United States in which mortality was assessed in 2950 individuals with hemophilia A or B over a three-year period, the median life expectancy was 38.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. HIV infection or AIDS was the most common cause of death, accounting for 124 of the 236 deaths recorded (53 percent); liver disease accounted for an additional 19 deaths (8 percent). When HIV-infected people were excluded from the analysis, life expectancy was 64.1 years. As noted above, care through a hemophilia treatment center (HTC) was associated with a longer life expectancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis#H3152089715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Hemophilia treatment centers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2022971881\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe hemophilia can have reductions in quality of life (QOL), self-esteem, and social interactions because of repeated bleeding episodes, chronic hemarthroses, transfusion-related infections, and other side effects of treatment such as the development of inhibitors. As an example, health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) was studied in 721 participants in the 2008 Hemophilia in the Netherlands 5 (HiN5) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Occupational disability was reported by 35 percent of the patients with severe hemophilia, compared with 9 percent in the general population (odds ratio [OR] for occupational disability with severe hemophilia, 3.1). Efforts are underway to study these issues in greater depth and to find additional ways to improve QOL in patients with severe hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407202574\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a 2016 report from the CDC and the Hemophilia Treatment Center Network (HTCN) in the United States, in which cause of death was assessed in 7486 men with hemophilia A or B, liver failure was the most common cause of death overall, accounting for 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-complications-and-age-related-comorbidities-in-people-with-hemophilia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Hemorrhage accounted for 15 percent of deaths in those with severe hemophilia and 11 percent in those with mild hemophilia.

Hemophilia is not a contraindication to HIV or HCV treatment. Liver transplantation is an option for those with severe liver disease; this also will cure the hemophilia.

Optimal management of these conditions is challenging because many of the interventions routinely used to treat these conditions increase bleeding risk.
