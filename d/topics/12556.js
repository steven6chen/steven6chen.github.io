These disorders are extremely common. The archaic term &quot;rheumatism&quot; is sometimes used to refer to these manifestations.</p><p>Although soft tissue rheumatic disorders refer to nonarticular pain, patients often attribute their symptoms to nearby joints. Thus, when patients complain of hip pain, the cause is often not pain in the joint itself, but rather in the &quot;hip region&quot;: the groin, buttock, upper lateral thigh, greater trochanteric area, and iliac crest. Similarly, complaints of elbow, wrist, knee, and shoulder pain frequently mean pain in the general region of those joints, and may reflect soft tissue lesions such as epicondylitis, tenosynovitis, and bursitis.</p><p>Soft tissue disorders may be divided into several broad categories and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tendinitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enthesitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasciitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bursitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurovascular entrapment disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myofascial pain syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized pain disorders</p><p/><p>Many of these disorders occur in the absence of systemic disease, and some are a consequence of chronic repetitive low-grade trauma and overuse. Many are self-limiting and respond to conservative measures.</p><p>This topic will provide a brief overview of the soft tissue rheumatic disorders. A general discussion on the approach to the patient with these disorders is also included. More detailed discussions of these disorders are presented separately.

Tendinitis often results from overuse or a sports injury but may also be due to inflammatory rheumatic diseases or metabolic disturbances such as calcium apatite deposition. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also been associated with the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Tendinitis, tendinosis, and tendinopathy are some of the terms used to characterize acute or chronic tendon pain. The term tendinitis can be confusing because inflammation is often not seen on histopathology, and the other terms may be more appropriate. For the purposes of this discussion, we will use the common term tendinitis. A more detailed discussion on terminology is included elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy#H32168053\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Pathology and terminology: tendinosis versus tendinitis'</a>.)</p><p>Common sites of tendinitis include supraspinatus tendinitis of the shoulder (rotator cuff tendinopathy), lateral and medial epicondylitis (tennis and golfer&rsquo;s elbow), bicipital tendinitis, Achilles tendinopathy, and flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris tendinitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biceps tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039367479\"><span class=\"h2\">Enthesitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The enthesis is the site of insertion of ligaments, tendons, joint capsules, and fascia to bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62565\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62565 \">figure 1</a>). Since the area is highly vascular, it is susceptible to bacterial invasion and antigen deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Enthesitis is often seen in spondyloarthropathies; common sites are the insertion of the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon region (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults#H61262077\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Musculoskeletal features'</a>). Ultrasonography is helpful for delineation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Enthesitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039367672\"><span class=\"h2\">Fasciitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fasciitis includes Dupuytren's palmar contracture, fascia lata fasciitis, and plantar fasciitis. They have discrete and disparate pathologies which include proliferation and degeneration of fascia. These disorders are discussed in more detail separately, as are other forms of fasciitis that have more systemic involvement, including necrotizing fasciitis and eosinophilic fasciitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupuytrens-contracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plantar-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plantar fasciitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic fasciitis&quot;</a>). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often in useful in identifying these conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213399284\"><span class=\"h2\">Bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bursitis is inflammation of the small fluid-filled pads, called bursae, that act as cushions between the bones and adjacent tendons and muscles, protecting the soft tissues from underlying bony prominences. Bursitis may result from direct trauma, repetitive injury, or infection, or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout. A diagnosis of bursitis is based on the findings of exquisite local tenderness at bursal sites, pain on motion and at rest, and sometimes associated regional loss of active movement. Swelling may be evident when bursitis occurs close to the body surface (eg, bunion or prepatellar bursitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213399474\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Musculoskeletal structural disorders are relatively common. In healthy young adults, for example, one study found that a total of 158 separate congenital, developmental, and acquired abnormalities were detected in 73 percent of 127 medical students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Findings included decreased joint range of motion and articular laxity, as well as synovitis, tendinitis, and bursitis. Participants in contact sports had the highest prevalence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-hypermobility-syndrome#H26926661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint hypermobility syndrome&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Subtle disorders often contribute significantly to pain syndromes in the lower extremity. &quot;Miserable malalignment syndrome&quot; is a term used to describe a combination of malalignments of the leg that include excess femoral anteversion with internal rotation of the hip, genu valgus, squinting patellae, external tibial torsion, and flat feet. Affected individuals are predisposed to overuse injuries and are often advised to avoid sports such as long-distance running. Structural disorders frequently contribute to injury in sports participants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Body asymmetry is a common cause of many regional pain disorders. When one side of the face is smaller, for example, temporomandibular joint dysfunction is more common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64450\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64450 \">picture 1</a>). The rest of the ipsilateral body may also be small in such patients, sometimes resulting in a scapulothoracic syndrome related to scoliosis or back pain in association with a short leg or an underdeveloped buttock.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213399587\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular entrapment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurovascular entrapment disorders may occur within the spinal canal (foraminal or central spinal stenosis) or nerve root, or along the course of a peripheral nerve. The peripheral sites most commonly affected are compression of the median nerve at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), compression of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel, and compression of the tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel. Less commonly, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in entrapped under the inguinal ligament (meralgia paresthetica). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meralgia-paresthetica-lateral-femoral-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic triad of peripheral neurovascular entrapment includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sensation of swelling and pain in the involved region</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paresthesias distal to the site of entrapment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness in advanced cases</p><p/><p>Tapping over an involved peripheral nerve (Tinel sign) or compression with an inflated blood pressure cuff proximal to the nerve may produce a sensation of electric shock and therefore aid in the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15807767\"><span class=\"h2\">Complex regional pain syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often related to nerve injury, other trauma, surgery, or a vascular event such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Alternative names include reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), algodystrophy, causalgia, and shoulder-hand syndrome. It was renamed by a consensus development conference in 1995 as CRPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is usually characterized clinically by exquisite burning pain, edema, allodynia, abnormal sudomotor activity, and hyperesthesia in the limb, which may feel cold or hot and may change color, and by local bone demineralization.</p><p>Two types of CRPS have been recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRPS type I (formerly termed RSD) &ndash; Refers to patients without a definable nerve lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRPS type II (formerly termed causalgia) &ndash; Refers to patients with a definable nerve lesion</p><p/><p>The causes, clinical features, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CRPS (RSD and causalgia) are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Prevention and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Myofascial pain syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a regional pain disorder caused by the presence of trigger points within muscles or their fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81019 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. It has been described as &quot;hyperirritable spots, usually within a taut band of skeletal muscle or in the muscle's fascia that is painful on compression and can give rise to characteristic referred pain, tenderness, and autonomic phenomena&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MPS shares some similar features with fibromyalgia which are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81771 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia#H1397504\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia&quot;, section on 'Myofascial pain syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>MPS is a relatively common source of chronic pain in the general population. The lack of universally accepted diagnostic criteria has resulted in variable estimates from epidemiologic studies, and most of the available data pertain to musculoskeletal pain in general. One study that estimated the prevalence of myofascial pain in a general internal medicine practice found that the primary complaint of 30 percent of patients was due to myofascial pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The pain of MPS is of a deep aching quality, occasionally accompanied by a sensation of burning or stinging. The pain often occurs in just one anatomic region, and patients often complain of restricted active movement in that area.</p><p>Myofascial trigger points (MTP) are the characteristic findings on physical exam. One or more trigger (pain) points will be found if the examiner gains familiarity with the likely point locations for each body region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66839%7ERHEUM%2F79295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66839 graphicRef79295 \">figure 3A-B</a>). Trigger points often feel indurated to palpation, and palpation reproduces the pain in the &quot;target zone,&quot; often at some distance away. Trigger points may result from acute trauma, repeated minor microtrauma of daily living, or the chronic strain of sedentary work or living habits. Thus, evaluation of such patients with myofascial pain should include inquiry into activities and habits of movement. Patients with whiplash-associated myofascial pain have a higher prevalence of trigger points along the semispinalis capitis muscle than at other sites in the neck, jaw, and upper shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-joint-protection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of joint protection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MPS may include other common regional pain disorders such as tension headaches, idiopathic low back and cervical strain disorders, repetitive strain syndromes, occupational overuse syndrome, cumulative trauma disorder, work-related musculoskeletal disorder, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In the head and neck, the pain may be associated with unexplained dizziness and with neurocognitive disturbances. The etiology of these complaints is not understood, although some neurovestibular abnormalities are often found in patients with TMJ and myofascial pain of the head. These poorly understood pain disorders are also associated with fatigue, sleep abnormalities, and mood disturbances, which may also be observed with fibromyalgia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a>). Chronic, unexplained pelvic and urethral pain, sometimes termed the female urethral syndrome, is often considered to be a variation of myofascial pain.</p><p>Many clinicians are skeptical about the existence of trigger points. Confusion also arises when differentiating trigger points from the tender points of fibromyalgia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 4</a>). Fibromyalgia tender points are said to differ in that they typically are not indurated and occur in tissues other than muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81771 \">table 1</a>). However, some find little difference in the tender point and trigger point examination in patients with fibromyalgia and MPS. A number of reports have questioned the reliability of the tender point evaluation, and they have been eliminated from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myofascial pain is generally treated similarly to fibromyalgia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>). However, myofascial pain also responds well to local treatments such as application of a cold spray and passive stretch of the involved muscle. Trigger point injections, using dry needling, saline, or botulinum toxin, have been effective in clinical trials for the treatment of myofascial pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/16,17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized pain disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized pain disorders include the hypermobility syndrome, fibromyalgia, and somatoform disorders. These disorders all may cause widespread pain and in some cases disability.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypermobility syndrome results from loss of muscle tone in a person with joint laxity. Widespread arthralgias and a sensation of joint swelling (without objective physical signs of swelling) that lasts for hours rather than days are typical of this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-hypermobility-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint hypermobility syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome marked by widespread pain, fatigue, and is often associated with a variety of other symptoms. There is often overlap of this disorder with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56019\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56019 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Six points of management can often be initiated during the first visit in a patient with a suspected soft tissue rheumatic disorder, even before the results of appropriate laboratory or radiologic tests are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclude systemic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eliminate aggravating factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain the illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide self-help strategies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide pain relief</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain prognosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Exclude systemic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory connective tissue disorders and other systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, occult neoplasm, and drug reactions should be considered and excluded, if possible, in patients presenting with a suspected soft tissue rheumatic disorder. Such concurrent disorders are common. In a classic study, nearly 300 patients with work-related carpal tunnel syndrome underwent a systematic search for concurrent medical diseases. One hundred and nine separate atraumatic illnesses (principally hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and various arthropathies) capable of causing arm pain or carpal tunnel syndrome were diagnosed. Nearly 70 percent of these conditions would have been missed if only record reviews and patient histories had been utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The extent of the work-up is dependent upon the diagnosis. As an example, a patient with tendinitis or bursitis following a cumulative movement strain is not likely to benefit from radiologic or laboratory studies. By contrast, a patient presenting with enthesitis of the Achilles tendon and inflammatory back pain who is under the age of 40 may require additional studies to evaluate for ankylosing spondylitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment can, in many cases, be initiated prior to receiving the test results.

In addition, validation that their problem is &quot;real&quot; (eg, in patients with myofascial pain syndrome [MPS] or fibromyalgia) often relieves anxiety.

Heat can readily be applied by hot packs or hot water bottles and can increase the threshold for pain, produce analgesia by acting on free nerve endings, and decrease muscle spasm. A review of the effects of superficial heat on low back pain showed moderate evidence for heat therapy providing a small short-term reduction in pain and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is not at all clear that heat should be used to treat patients with inflammatory diseases. Heat is not indicated in acute arthritis, since it contributes to increased inflammation and pain, but may be helpful for some patients with moderate joint inflammation, where it may reduce pain and muscle spasm. Ice is sometimes useful to control pain and swelling because it induces vasoconstriction of superficial and intra-articular tissues, reduces local metabolism, and slows nerve conduction. It may be applied using cold packs, ice baths, and vapocoolant sprays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In addition to the RICE regimen, other simple, frequently used measures include use of oral or topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and other topical applications with agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F93846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93846 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>If simple measures have not sufficed, injecting the affected area with a long-acting glucocorticoid-local anesthetic mixture can be effective in bursitis, tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or MPS. (See appropriate topic reviews for description of the injection technique in the different disorders.)</p><p>The use of diagnostic ultrasound promises to greatly improve our diagnostic accuracy and broaden our understanding of soft tissue rheumatic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Ultrasonography should also afford greater precision in defining sites to be injected with corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Acupuncture is another method that is employed to relieve pain. Its clinical value varies and seems to be based on the condition being treated and the specific methodology employed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since it is not at all clear that botulinum toxin injections are clearly superior to the injection of less costly agents, we do not recommend using botulinum toxin for tender or trigger point injections. Several studies suggest that botulinum toxin type A may provide pain relief in MPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>], while others have found an analgesic effect similar to injection of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] or saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and less than or similar to that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Relief from carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis, or tendinitis may require only a few days, while symptoms due to hypermobility syndrome or disorders of other structural deficits may require several months before moderate or great improvement is seen.</p><p>The expected clinical course should be explained to the patient at the initial visit if possible. Patients should also understand that this course is dependent upon the performance of the self-help program, and that their response to the program may impact the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20377049\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue rheumatic disorders refer to nonsystemic, focal pathologic syndromes involving the periarticular tissues, including muscle, tendon, ligament, fascia, aponeurosis, retinaculum, bursa, and subcutaneous tissue. These disorders are extremely common. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue disorders may be divided into several broad categories and include tendinitis, enthesitis, fasciitis, bursitis, structural disorders, neurovascular entrapment disorders, complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS), and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). Many of these disorders occur in the absence of systemic disease, and some are a consequence of chronic repetitive low grade trauma and overuse. Many are self-limiting and respond to conservative measures. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Specific syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tendinitis (or tendonitis), which often results from overuse, is a disorder with common features of local pain and dysfunction, inflammation, and degeneration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enthesitis, which is an inflammation of the site of the insertion of the tendon to the bone, is often seen in spondyloarthropathies. Common sites are the insertion of the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon region. (See <a href=\"#H1039367479\" class=\"local\">'Enthesitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bursitis is inflammation of the small fluid-filled pads, called bursae. Bursitis may result from direct trauma or repetitive injury, infection, or it may be a manifestation of a systemic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout. (See <a href=\"#H1213399284\" class=\"local\">'Bursitis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Musculoskeletal structural disorders are relatively common, sometimes subtle, and often contribute to pain syndromes and to injury in sports participants. Body asymmetry is a common cause for many regional pain disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1213399474\" class=\"local\">'Structural disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurovascular entrapment disorders may occur within the spinal canal (foraminal or central spinal stenosis) or along the course of a peripheral nerve. The diagnostic triad of peripheral neurovascular entrapment includes a sensation of swelling and pain in the involved region, paresthesias distal to the site of entrapment, and weakness. (See <a href=\"#H1213399587\" class=\"local\">'Neurovascular entrapment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A diagnosis of CRPS requires the presence of regional pain and sensory changes following a noxious event, often far from the involved site. The pain is of a severity greater than that expected from the inciting injury and is associated with characteristic clinical findings. (See <a href=\"#H15807767\" class=\"local\">'Complex regional pain syndromes'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Prevention and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In MPS, hyperirritable spots, often in just one body region, usually within a taut band of skeletal muscle or in the muscle's fascia, can give rise to characteristic referred pain. There are usually one or more trigger (pain) points; these are typically indurated and painful on compression. Myofascial trigger points may result from acute trauma, repeated minor microtrauma of daily living, or from a chronic strain of sedentary work or living habits. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Myofascial pain syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia#H1397504\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia&quot;, section on 'Myofascial pain syndromes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six points of management can often be initiated during the first visit in a patient with a suspected soft tissue rheumatic disorder, even before the results of appropriate laboratory or radiologic tests are available. These are excluding systemic disease, eliminating aggravating factors, explaining the illness, explaining self-help strategies, providing pain relief, and explaining the prognosis.
