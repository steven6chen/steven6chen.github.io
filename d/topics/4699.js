Although it was thought to primarily affect children, it is being diagnosed increasingly in adults.</p><p>CVS was first described in France in 1861 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The first English-language publication, in 1882, described three essential clinical features of the disorder, which still hold true today [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three or more recurrent discrete episodes of vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varying intervals of completely normal (or baseline) health between episodes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes are stereotypical with regard to timing of onset, symptoms, and duration</p><p/><p>A critical fourth criterion that has been added subsequently includes the absence of an organic cause of vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children and adults. A guideline on this topic has also been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is no longer considered to be rare in children. Studies in predominantly Caucasian populations have reported a prevalence of 1.9 to 2.3 percent and an incidence of 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/100,000</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The average age was 9.6 years at the time of diagnosis, while the average age at the onset of symptoms was 5.3 years. The overall gender ratio appears to be higher in girls than boys by a ratio of 55:45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/4,8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-13</a>]. A family in which CVS appears to be inherited has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The disorder appears to be less common in adults, although there are no population-based studies from which prevalence estimates can be derived. One of the largest studies included 101 adult patients seen during a six-year period at an academic medical center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Adult patients could be divided into two groups, pediatric and adult onset groups beginning at mean ages of 13 and 32 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. These groups also differed significantly in gender profiles (86 percent versus 57 percent female). Another study found that the CVS began at an average age of 35 (range 14 to 73 years) but was not diagnosed until patients were on average 41 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The average length of episodes was six days (range 1 to 21 days), with symptom-free intervals averaging three months (range 0.5 to 6 months). Similar findings have been described in other reports in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Although there appear to be similarities in CVS across age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], a few differences between adults and children have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults have on average approximately four cycles per year in contrast with 12 cycles per year in children and adults with young onset CVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults have longer episodes of six days' duration in contrast to children with a mean of two days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age of onset covers a broad span in adults, while in children the age of onset is often in the toddler or preschool years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults have usually been symptomatic for longer prior to diagnosis, possibly reflecting the increased recognition of CVS by pediatricians.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggering events are less common in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea between episodes (coalescent CVS) is more common in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CVS in children, but not in adults, is highly associated with two common mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms, 16519T and 3010A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) remains unknown, and it may represent a heterogeneous group of disorders. An association between CVS and migraine headaches has been most consistently described, suggesting that there may be a common pathophysiologic process. However, CVS has also been linked to autonomic abnormalities (elevated sympathetic tone), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation (Sato variant), mitochondrial dysfunction, menses (estrogen sensitivity), and food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">CVS and migraines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CVS has been linked to migraine headaches and abdominal migraine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80667 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This connection is based upon the discreteness of episodes, the progression from cyclic vomiting to migraine headaches in many patients, the presence of a strong family history of migraine headaches in affected children (approximately 80 percent), and the response to antimigraine therapy in up to 80 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. Sympathetic autonomic dysfunction may predispose children to both CVS and migraine headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of migraine in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based upon the prevalence data, CVS (mean age five) may lead to abdominal migraines (age nine), which in turn lead to migraine headaches (age 11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, more children progress directly from CVS to migraines than from CVS to abdominal migraines to migraines. Abdominal migraines can be distinguished from CVS in that the core symptom of abdominal migraines is abdominal pain, with little or no vomiting. Both syndromes may have headache as a feature and respond to antimigraine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitochondrial disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitochondrial disorders of fatty acid oxidation (eg, medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency), respiratory chain defects (eg, MELAS: Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Syndrome), and mitochondrial DNA deletions can be associated with episodes of metabolic crisis and vomiting, usually triggered with infection or prolonged fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hereditary ataxias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One group suggested that about one-half of patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome have evidence for maternal inheritance of a mitochondrial DNA sequence variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Compared with controls, mothers of affected patients were more likely to have a history of migraine, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and hypothyroidism, disorders that the researchers hypothesized may cluster in families with cyclic vomiting syndrome due to predisposing mitochondrial DNA sequence variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The efficacy of mitochondrial-targeted therapies, coenzyme Q10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] and L-carnitine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] and L-carnitine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>], in CVS strengthens the hypothesis of a mitochondrial component in disease pathogenesis. This hypothesis is further strengthened by an association of both CVS and migraine headache with the same two mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adults have been found to have augmented sympathetic tone with low to normal parasympathetic tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/15,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25</a>]. Adolescent patients with CVS are frequently found to meet criteria for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and treatment of that comorbid condition helps prevent episodes of vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients who have a hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy (such as Riley Day Syndrome) can also have clinical features resembling CVS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperreactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated corticotropin, cortisol, vasopressin, prostaglandin E2, and catecholamines have been described in a group of children with cyclic vomiting, profound lethargy, and hypertension, the so-called Sato variant characterized by hypertension and prolonged episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Animal studies suggest that CVS may be a brain-gut disorder in which corticotropin-releasing factor induces gastric stasis and vomiting by vagal stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1429156916\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine (catamenial CVS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to menstrual migraine headaches, some girls develop catamenial CVS at the onset of their menstrual period. Some respond to treatment with a low-dose estrogen or progesterone-only birth control pill, although oral contraceptives and other steroids can also precipitate vomiting episodes and other symptomatology in some. An association between symptoms and menses has also been described in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Food allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensitivity to cow's milk, soy, and egg white protein may be a trigger for CVS attacks in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similar to migraines, other food triggers include chocolate, cheese, and monosodium glutamate. The relationship between food allergy and CVS is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cannabis use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cessation of prolonged, high-dose cannabis use has been associated with resolution of episodic vomiting in case reports suggesting a causal link [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. In one series, the association was characterized by repetitive hot water bathing behavior during vomiting cycles, which can also be seen during CVS attacks in both adults (56 percent) and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/20,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,37</a>]. However, many adults with CVS self-medicate with cannabis to alleviate their daily nausea, and this can be a source of diagnostic confusion. At present, the distinction between CVS and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (Rome IV criteria) is unclear as there is definite phenotypic overlap between the two conditions. Clearcut CVS can be delineated once cannabis-using patients abstain from cannabis for at least two weeks; if the emesis continues, then further work-up for CVS can be undertaken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the proposed diagnostic criteria suggests two essential features of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS).

In children, nausea and lethargy are considered to be key diagnostic features.</p><p>The specific pattern of vomiting episodes is variable among patients but, importantly, is stereotypical for an individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In general, CVS episodes tend to begin in the early morning hours (2:00 to 7:00 AM) and last approximately the same duration. Most have a prodromal period of pallor, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lethargy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62483 \">table 2</a>). In children, the attacks last an average of 24 to 48 hours. Approximately one-half of children have attacks at regular intervals, commonly occurring every two to four weeks, while the others have an unpredictable temporal pattern of vomiting. Approximately three-quarters of parents can identify a trigger, which is usually infectious (upper respiratory) or psychological (negative or positive) events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>As noted above, episodes tend to be longer in adults (approximately three to six days) with longer intervening intervals of normal health (approximately three months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Although intervening periods of normal health are important for distinguishing CVS from functional nausea and vomiting, as many as 40 to 63 percent have interictal nausea or low-grade daily vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54863 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Frequently observed characteristics on presentation and difficulty in establishing the diagnosis are illustrated in the following studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/16,17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each patient had been evaluated by at least two physicians (typically with repeated imaging and endoscopic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]) and had been hospitalized at least once.

A minority of children who progress from CVS to migraine headaches will first pass through a phase of abdominal migraines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consistent with NASPGHAN recommendations, in the absence of the warning signs we limit evaluation to screening laboratory testing (electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine) and urinalysis during an episode. An upper gastrointestinal series to the ligament of Treitz should be performed in all children to exclude malrotation or non-fixation with possible intermittent volvulus. In those with unilateral or flank pain, an abdominal ultrasound should be performed to exclude acute hydronephrosis. In those with metabolic warning signs, a lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, serum amino acids, and urine organic acids should be performed during the early part of the episode before intravenous fluids are administered. For those with neurological signs, a computed <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/magnetic</span> resonance imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">(CT/MRI)</span> scan of the head should be performed. For upper gastrointestinal bleeding, an endoscopy usually reveals prolapse gastropathy or Mallory-Weiss tear. For those with persisting upper gastrointestinal symptoms between episodes, an upper endoscopy should be performed between episodes. The presence of esophagitis on endoscopy (performed during or near an episode) does not imply that reflux is an underlying cause, since half of patients will have esophagitis but will not respond to antireflux measures.</p><p>Only one in eight children with recurring cyclical or sporadic episodes of vomiting who were evaluated extensively were found to have another underlying disorder that required intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the cost of an extensive diagnostic testing and annual ambulatory and hospital treatment of CVS was estimated to be $17,035 per child in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A cost decision-analysis concluded that a more cost-effective diagnostic strategy in children was to obtain an upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) to rule out malrotation followed by a two-month trial of antimigraine therapy, with further studies reserved for those with continued symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In adults, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis has been suggested to exclude malignancy and other structural disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may require supportive care during severe bouts of cyclic vomiting, which may include admission to the emergency department <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospital, intravenous fluids, antiemetics, sedatives, and occasionally analgesics. Children should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist, neurologist, or metabolic specialist. Recognized precipitating factors (more commonly observed in children) should be avoided whenever feasible. Examples include physical exhaustion from lack of sleep, motion (car rides, amusement park rides), fasting, and certain foods (eg, chocolate, cheese).</p><p>No specific therapy has been proven to be effective for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in controlled trials. However, several large open-label series in both children and adults indicate that there is effective empiric treatment, especially tricyclic antidepressants. Treatment with medications should be guided by three considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether there is a family history of migraines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency of episodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of episodes</p><p/><p>Treatment can also be considered as abortive (administered during the prodrome or onset of the attack), prophylactic (given daily to prevent further episodes), and supportive (provided during the attack to alleviate symptoms).</p><p>The decision to administer prophylactic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abortive medications depends upon the frequency and severity of the attacks, similar to the principles that guide treatment of patients with migraine headaches. Abortive therapy can be used if episodes occur less than once every one to two months or are mild. In contrast, prophylactic daily therapy with antimigraine medications is warranted if attacks occur more than once every one to two months or are severe enough to require hospitalization or substantial disability.</p><p>A trial of antimigraine medications is also reasonable in patients with a family history of migraine headaches. In children, a history of migraines in the family or patient was associated with 79 percent response to an antimigraine agent compared with 36 percent in those without a migraine association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The single most effective agent based upon large case series in children and adults is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, a tricyclic antidepressant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/16,24,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24,49,50</a>]. Some authors recommend antimigraine therapy even in the absence of a personal or family history of migraines if, after careful evaluation, the diagnosis of CVS seems certain. The choice of specific agents is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2523266804\"><span class=\"h2\">Abortive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triptans and NK1 antagonists have had an abortive effect in some children. There was a response in 54 percent of 35 attacks using subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> and 33 percent of six attacks using the nasal spray. Sumatriptan appears more effective if administered early in the prodromal phase and if the episodes are shorter in duration.

Low-dose estrogen or progesterone-only birth control pills can be used as directed in females with catamenial CVS in whom vomiting attacks occur at the time of menses; however, birth control pills can also exacerbate symptoms in CVS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/4,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,54</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrogen-associated-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estrogen-associated migraine&quot;</a>).

The goal becomes one of alleviating symptoms including vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and headache and replenishing fluid, energy, and electrolytes. Anecdotal experience in children suggests that intravenous administration of a 10 percent dextrose solution can decrease the frequency and duration of vomiting episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] in about one-half of patients. Between emesis, frequent low-fat feedings have been advocated to decrease the frequency of episodes. These observations may have a pathophysiologic basis in the impaired carbohydrate and fat metabolism that has been described in children with mitochondrial variants that may predispose to cyclic vomiting syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mitochondrial disorders'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to 10 percent intravenous dextrose, anecdotal experience suggests that high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> (0.3 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/dose,</span> maximum about 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose),</span> sedation (eg, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>), and a quiet, dark room to reduce stimulation are often helpful. However, it has been recommended that intravenous doses of ondansetron not exceed 16 mg (8 mg for patients &ge;75 years old) because of the risk of QT prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Management of abdominal and headache pain usually begins with the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>. If possible, narcotics should avoided as they can worsen vomiting and induce dependence over time. Taking long, hot showers or baths occurs more commonly in adults with CVS (56 percent) but also occurs in children as well. Drinking water to induce vomiting (and thus lessening nausea) is a common behavior and does not indicate a factitious or psychiatric etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2540764564\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents that have been used prophylactically (with variable success) in children include antimigraine agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>), antiemetics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aprepitant</a>), anticonvulsants (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>), prokinetics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>), and mitochondrial supplements (carnitine, coenzyme Q10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/31-33,49,51,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33,49,51,57,58</a>].

Up to 50 percent may experience anticholinergic (dry mouth, constipation) and sedative side effects (morning tiredness). Cardiotoxicity (tachyarrhythmia) can be avoided by maintaining the QTc interval &lt;460 msec. It typically takes one to two months for the effects of amitriptyline to become evident once the target dose is reached. Some CVS patients who do not respond to 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day have very low or undetectable blood levels of amitriptyline and respond when the amitriptyline dose is further increased and blood levels reach therapeutic levels of 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Although it appears to affect primarily children, it is being recognized increasingly in adults, beginning either in childhood or adulthood. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of CVS remains unknown, although it may represent a heterogeneous group of disorders. An association between CVS and migraine headaches has been consistently described in the majority of patients, suggesting that there may be a common pathophysiologic process. However, CVS has also been linked to mitochondrial disorders, autonomic dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperreactivity, endocrine sensitivity (catamenial CVS), food allergy, and possibly chronic high-dose cannabis use. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criteria have been proposed based upon consensus of experts by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and Rome IV Committees. The specific pattern, severity, and duration of vomiting episodes varies among patients but, importantly, is stereotypical for an individual patient. Cyclic vomiting syndrome remains a diagnosis based primarily upon the history and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment can be considered as prophylactic, abortive, and supportive. Most treatments have been based upon case series, open-label trials, or clinical experience, forming the basis for the following suggested approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If episodes occur more often than monthly, if they are prolonged or debilitating, or if they result in recurrent emergency department or hospital admissions, daily prophylactic therapy is recommended. If episodes are less frequent or are mild, abortive therapy at the onset of episodes is often preferred. If abortive therapy fails after two or three attempts, a switch to prophylactic therapy is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The NASPGHAN Consensus Statement recommends first-line prophylactic therapy based upon age, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a> for children under five years and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> for those five and over. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> is the recommended second-line prophylactic agent. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pizotifen-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pizotifen</a>, a drug similar to cyproheptadine, is available outside of the United States. In adults, amitriptyline appears effective even if there is no history of headache or family history of migraine. Amitriptyline which can be safely administered and side effects minimized is used as follows. Begin at a low dose (0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and titrate as needed to 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or higher per day at bedtime. Monitor for side effects and obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) for QTc interval at the target dose and above.

These agents appear more effective if administered during the prodromal phase prior to onset of vomiting. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care is initiated if abortive approaches fail and is used to alleviate symptoms and replace fluid losses in the emergency department or hospital. This includes intravenously administered fluids, antiemetics, analgesics, and sedatives. In children, NASPGHAN recommendations include intravenous dextrose (10 percent), high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> (0.3 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose, up to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>.
