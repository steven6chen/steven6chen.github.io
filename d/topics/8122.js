In one series of 549 patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of focal hepatic lesion(s), 585 of 805 lesions (72 percent) were hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Hemangiomas are often solitary, but multiple lesions may be present in both the right and left lobe of the liver in up to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They range in size from a few millimeters to over 20 cm. The majority are small (&lt;5 cm). Those larger than 5 cm have been referred to as giant hemangiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Most patients with hepatic hemangiomas are asymptomatic and have an excellent prognosis. Symptoms are more likely with large lesions. The diagnosis is often considered in patients found to have a focal liver lesion in whom hemangiomas need to be distinguished from other tumors. An approach to such patients is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of hepatic hemangiomas have ranged from 0.4 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. The highest estimates have been derived from autopsy studies, suggesting that these lesions are common in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. This observation is confirmed by the increasing recognition of hemangiomas in asymptomatic patients undergoing radiologic imaging tests of the abdomen for other reasons.</p><p>Although they can be diagnosed at any age, 60 to 80 percent of cases are diagnosed in patients who are between the ages of 30 and 50 years. In adults, hemangiomas occur more frequently in women with a ratio of 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Lesions responsible for symptoms are more likely in young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The etiology of hepatic hemangiomas is incompletely understood. They are considered to be vascular malformations or hamartomas of congenital origin that enlarge by ectasia rather than by hyperplasia or hypertrophy.</p><p>Hormonal influence over tumor growth is suggested by enlargement during pregnancy and estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> therapy and regression after withdrawal of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In one report, enlargement occurred over time in 23 percent of patients receiving estrogen hormone therapy as compared with only 10 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, estrogen receptors have not been demonstrated in all tumors, and tumor growth has been demonstrated in the absence of estrogen therapy and in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, cavernous hemangiomas vary in size from a few millimeters to many centimeters. The larger lesion may be pedunculated and on gross examination appear as cystic lesions with a dark color. They can be found in both lobes of the liver, but are more often found in the right lobe. Lesions are well circumscribed and often surrounded by a thin capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The cut surfaces exhibit a red-brown appearance with a spongy consistency that may show hemorrhage, scarring, or calcification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53994\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53994 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Microscopically, the tumor is composed of cavernous vascular spaces of varying sizes, lined by a single layer of flat endothelium and filled with blood. The vascular compartments are separated by thin fibrous septae and may contain thrombi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65735 \">picture 2</a>). Large hemangiomas may develop a collagenous scar or fibrous nodule as thrombosis occurs. Rarely, there may be focal stromal calcification and ossification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cavernous hemangiomas of the liver may be associated with hemangiomas in other organs, bile duct hamartomas, and focal nodular hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangiomas are typically discovered incidentally at laparotomy, autopsy, or during an imaging test performed for unrelated conditions. Lesions &gt;4 cm are more likely to cause symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The most common symptoms are abdominal pain and right upper quadrant discomfort or fullness. However, the relationship of the hemangioma to symptoms is not always clear. In one report, for example, abdominal pain was due to other causes in 54 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Less common symptoms include nausea, anorexia, and early satiety, which may develop with large hemangiomas due to compression of adjacent organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Acute abdominal pain can result from thrombosis or bleeding within the tumor and associated stretching and inflammation of Glisson's capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Discomfort from an acute thrombosis can last up to three weeks and be associated with fever and abnormal liver function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Giant hemangiomas in children have been associated with high-output cardiac failure and hypothyroidism. High-output cardiac failure is reported in numerous case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one series of 16 infants presenting with hepatic hemangiomas within four months of birth, 58 percent were diagnosed with high-output cardiac failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Hypothyroidism is due to the presence of high levels of 3 iodothyronine deiodinase activity in the hemangioma tissue, which catalyzes the conversion of thyroxine and triiodothyronine to biologically inactive hormones, reverse triiodothyronine, and 3,3'-diiodothyronine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Cutaneous hemangiomas in children may be a marker for hepatic hemangiomas. In one report, hepatic hemangiomas were detected by ultrasound in 22 percent of infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a study of infants presenting to a dermatology clinic with numerous (&gt;6) or one large (&gt;5 cm) cutaneous hemangioma(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], the presence of a single large cutaneous hemangioma was generally associated with a single hepatic hemangioma while multiple or miliary cutaneous hemangiomas were associated with the presence of multiple hepatic hemangiomas.</p><p>The Kasabach-Merritt syndrome is a consumptive coagulopathy in children that has been described in association with giant hemangiomas. Patients have severe thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated fibrin degradation products, and fragmentation of red blood cells. However, the association with hemangiomas has been questioned since detailed evaluation of affected patients has suggested that the associated tumor may actually be a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (a rare malignant tumor), which can resemble a giant hemangioma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorpuscular non-immune hemolytic anemia: Fragmentation hemolysis and hypersplenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other rare presentations include the development of hemobilia following rupture into the biliary tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and steroid-resistant polymyalgia rheumatica, which can be cured by resection of the hemangioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Hepatic hemangiomatosis, the presence of innumerable hemangiomas, is rare in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/16,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32</a>]. The etiology is unknown, although an association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia-osler-weber-rendu-syndrome#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Hepatic involvement'</a>.)</p><p>Physical findings are usually unremarkable, but occasionally reveal a palpable liver or mass. A bruit is seldom heard over the hemangioma.</p><p>Liver function tests are usually normal, unless there has been a complication such as thrombosis, bleeding, or compression of the biliary tree. Alpha-fetoprotein is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of hepatic hemangiomas is incompletely understood, and studies describing clinical and radiologic follow-up have reported variable results, with progression rates ranging from 18 to 39 percent over 1 to 10 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/6,10,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,35-39</a>]. In one study that followed the progress of 68 hemangiomas in 47 patients over one to six years, 56 hemangiomas (82 percent) remained unchanged in size, three lesions could not be found, seven were less obvious, one smaller, and only one lesion was found to have increased in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a second series that included 150 hemangiomas (mean size 3.2 cm) that were examined on at least two imaging studies at least one year apart, the mean annual volumetric growth rate was 3 percent, and 39 percent of lesions increased in size by 5 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Larger lesions were more likely to demonstrate growth. Among the lesions less than 3 cm at baseline, 19 of 46 (41 percent) grew by 5 percent or more, whereas among the lesions 5 cm or larger, 9 of 16 (56 percent) grew by 5 percent or more. </p><p>Significant growth has been demonstrated in occasional patients with resultant symptoms and need for surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/17,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,40,41</a>]. Development of spontaneous rupture is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/8,10,42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,42-45</a>]. It usually occurs in large hemangiomas that are peripherally located; however, follow-up of giant hemangiomas (tumors &gt;5 cm in size) has shown that even these rarely enlarge or rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Traumatic rupture of cavernous hemangioma following blunt trauma to the abdomen is also rare, but highlights that traumatic rupture of the liver may be associated with underlying liver pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Iatrogenic rupture or intratumoral bleeding has been described following liver biopsy or fine-needle aspiration, which has resulted in a reluctance of most clinicians to perform such tests in patients with known or suspected hemangiomas. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous needle biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic hemangiomas have characteristics that can suggest the diagnosis on ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A minority of lesions are atypical and may require multiple imaging tests to achieve a confident diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain abdominal radiographs may show calcification within the tumor. However calcification is not specific for hemangiomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound typically reveals a well-demarcated, homogeneous, hyperechoic mass. The hemangioma may be hypoechoic in patients with fatty infiltration of the liver due to the bright signal from the surrounding parenchyma. Blood flow within the hemangioma can be demonstrated by color Doppler in only 10 to 50 percent of hemangiomas, and thus color Doppler does not improve the accuracy of ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. Sonographic findings also depend upon the size of the hemangioma. One study characterized 158 hemangiomas as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions &lt;2 cm had an echogenic pattern</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions between 2 and 5 cm were mainly echogenic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77575\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77575 \">image 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions &gt;5 cm had mixed echogenicity probably because of intratumoral thrombosis and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, some malignant liver lesions have similar acoustic patterns, and therefore other imaging modalities are usually required for confirmation. On the other hand, the diagnosis can be strongly suggested by ultrasound in approximately 80 percent of patients with lesions &lt;6 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible hemangioma on ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting recommendations regarding the appropriate follow-up for patients with &quot;typical&quot; ultrasound appearance of a hepatic hemangioma ranging from confirmatory cross-sectional contrast-enhanced imaging to repeat ultrasound after a time interval. As noted above, the radiological appearances of a hemangioma on ultrasound overlap with those of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic metastases. As a result, the follow-up care of patients with an ultrasound diagnosis of a hemangioma depends upon their risk of primary or secondary hepatic malignancy.</p><p>All patients with a history of liver disease or known or suspected extrahepatic malignancy should undergo a confirmatory examination such as a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. In patients with no evidence of liver disease or extrahepatic malignancy and &quot;typical&quot; appearances of hemangioma on ultrasound, an acceptable alternative is to repeat the ultrasound at three to six months to document stability. In a study of 213 &quot;typical&quot; hepatic hemangiomas, one lesion (0.47 percent) classified as a hemangioma was later diagnosed as a neuroendocrine hepatic metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, one patient had a coexistent lung mass on chest radiograph on the same day he was diagnosed with a liver lesion that was a &quot;typical&quot; hemangioma, but was subsequently diagnosed with a hepatic metastasis from a lung cancer. Thus, patients with a possible hepatic hemangioma who subsequently develop liver disease or extrahepatic malignancy require further evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Contrast-enhanced ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound contrast agents consist of gas-filled echogenic microbubbles that enhance the ultrasound signal produced by flowing blood. Contrast agents may improve the detection of focal liver lesions and tumor vascularity. Hepatic hemangiomas have a peripheral globular contrast pooling in the early phase that become larger and more numerous in later phases. In one study of 58 patients with histologically proven hemangiomas, 74 percent of patients had the typical peripheral nodular enhancement while 10 percent of cases were indeterminate and 16 percent had dense homogenous arterial enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a separate study of the time-related changes of enhancement appearance, the use of a diffuse and partial enhancement pattern in the early phase had sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of hemangioma of 79 and 100 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A non-contrast-enhanced CT scan of a hemangioma usually demonstrates a well-demarcated hypodense mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70560\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70560 \">image 2</a>). Calcifications are seen in approximately 10 percent of cases. Similar to ultrasound, the lesions may appear as hyperdense relative to the surrounding parenchyma in patients with fatty infiltration of the surrounding liver.</p><p>The administration of contrast results in a peripheral nodular enhancement in the early phase, followed by a centripetal pattern or &quot;filling in&quot; during the late phase. Peripheral nodular or globular enhancement representing venous lakes is seen in up to 94 percent of hemangiomas &gt;4 cm in size. A pattern of globular enhancement isodense to the aorta is seen in 67 percent of hemangiomas, a feature that helps distinguish them from hepatic metastases.</p><p>The lesions classically opacify after a delay of three or more minutes and remain isodense or hyperdense on delayed scans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70560\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70560 \">image 2</a>). Possible exceptions are hemangiomas &gt;4 cm, in which the center of the lesion may not opacify completely. Variations in vascular enhancement among hemangiomas may be due to differences in the size of the vascular spaces, the presence of cystic spaces, and the amount of scar tissue within hemangiomas. Absence of enhancement is seen in hemangiomas with large cystic areas or scar tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI has emerged as a highly accurate, noninvasive technique for diagnosing hemangiomas with a sensitivity of approximately 90 percent and a specificity of 91 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The typical MRI appearance is a smooth, well-demarcated, homogeneous mass that has low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and is hyperintense on T2-weighted images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77870\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77870 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57</a>]. The presence of intratumoral fibrosis results in areas of low intensity on T2-weighted images.</p><p>Administration of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) results in early peripheral discontinuous nodular or globular enhancement on arterial phase imaging with progressive centripetal enhancement or &quot;filling in&quot; on delayed scans similar to that seen on CT scanning. This enhancement pattern is typical of most hemangiomas &gt;2 cm; tumors &lt;2 cm show a homogeneous enhancement on early phase images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Small hemangiomas that demonstrate rapid uniform enhancement are sometimes indistinguishable from hypervascular metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Technetium-99m pertechnetate-labeled red blood cell pool study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technetium-99m pertechnetate-labeled red blood cell pool studies (99mTc-RBC pool studies) show initial hypoperfusion during arterial flow, which is followed by gradual increase of tracer peaking 30 to 50 minutes after the injection. Retention of the isotope within the lesion remains on delayed images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79488\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79488 \">image 4</a>). Sensitivity for lesions &gt;2 cm in size varies from 69 to 92 percent. Specificity approximates 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/60-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-63</a>]. False negatives can occur due to the presence of fibrosis or thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. False-positive tests are rare, but include lesions such as hypervascular malignancies and angiosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) using 99mTc-RBC increases the spatial resolution of planar scintigraphy, providing sensitivity and accuracy close to that of MRI for lesions &gt;1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The best use of 99mTc-RBC SPECT is for lesions &gt;2 cm to confirm a suspected hemangioma seen as a hyperechoic lesion in ultrasound and to clarify the diagnosis when CT findings are unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiography is rarely used for diagnosis. It is reserved for atypical tumors that cannot be diagnosed definitively after multiple noninvasive imaging tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Classical features include a large feeding vessel with displacement and diffuse pooling of contrast that produces a characteristic &quot;cotton wool&quot; appearance that persists during the venous phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with cirrhosis or history of malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a hepatic hemangioma can frequently be made confidently with ultrasound in patients without a history of malignancy or chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, because alternative diagnoses are more likely in patients with a history of malignancy or chronic liver disease, multiple imaging modalities and serum AFP determination may be required to differentiate a benign hemangioma from hyperechoic metastases or HCC as these may have similar sonographic characteristics.

All patients had undergone a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Five of the lesions were not seen on CT (all were less than 2.5 cm). A confident diagnosis of hemangioma could only be made in 11 of the 16 identified lesions; 3 required further evaluation while 2 were incorrectly labeled as &quot;suggestive of HCC.&quot; Follow-up revealed that seven hemangiomas became smaller in size and five subcapsular lesions developed overlying scar retraction, a feature previously associated with malignant hepatic neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PERCUTANEOUS NEEDLE BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a suspected hemangioma is still being debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/70-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-76</a>]. The procedure has been associated with fatal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]; large superficial lesions in subcapsular locations appear to pose the greatest risk. In addition, there is a low diagnostic yield from FNABs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. In one report, for example, FNAB was performed in 36 patients, 18 of whom had inconclusive radiological findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Diagnostic material was obtained from only 21 individuals, one of whom developed significant bleeding requiring transfusion. We do not recommend use of needle aspiration or biopsy in the evaluation of a possible hemangioma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481653725\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic patients, particularly those with lesions &lt;1.5 cm, can be reassured and observed. As discussed above, long-term follow-up of hemangiomas in such patients has confirmed that most do not grow or develop complications. We do not recommend follow-up imaging in patients with hemangiomas &le;5 cm in size, provided there is certainty of the diagnosis based on radiologic and on clinical details. On the other hand, rapid growth of a hemangioma has been reported, justifying radiologic follow-up of patients with lesions &gt;5 cm, particularly those in a sub capsular location. Our approach is to repeat imaging in 6 to 12 months for such lesions, using the imaging modality that best showed the hemangioma previously (eg, computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging). If there is no change in the size of the lesion, we do not perform additional imaging. In the absence of symptoms, the risk of bleeding is too low to justify prophylactic resection. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2293010398\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have pain or symptoms suggestive of extrinsic compression of adjacent structures should be considered for surgical resection. However, it is important that all other causes of pain have been evaluated and excluded prior to surgery. This approach is supported in one report in which 25 percent of patients had persistence of symptoms after surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Overall, indications for surgical intervention have decreased to approximately 2 percent and include the development of complications such as rupture and intraperitoneal bleeding, which has a 20 percent mortality rate, incapacitating symptoms due to large hemangiomas, or failure to exclude a malignancy by radiologic studies. Giant hemangiomas only rarely turn out to be malignant vascular tumors when resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four surgical methods are available for the treatment of hemangiomas: liver resection, enucleation, hepatic artery ligation, and liver transplantation. Mortality from surgical resection is negligible in specialized hepatobiliary centers. However, some studies suggest enucleation is associated with less blood loss and transfusion requirements compared with resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/77-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-82</a>]. However, one study that included 40 patients who underwent surgery for hemangiomas (28 liver resections and 12 enucleations) found no difference between the procedures with regard to mortality, morbidity, or transfusion requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Some authors advocate routinely performing complete extrahepatic ligation of the main arterial supply before attempting enucleation of a hemangioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Several reports have described using transcatheter arterial embolization to shrink giant hemangiomas or to treat acute bleeding prior to surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/83-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-89</a>].</p><p>Orthotopic liver transplantation has also been used successfully to treat symptomatic patients with unresectable giant hemangiomas and hemangiomas associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-surgical treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-surgical techniques include hepatic artery embolization, radiotherapy, and interferon alfa-2a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/83,93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,93-95</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial embolization has been used to control acute bleeding, to manage symptoms, and to shrink hemangiomas prior to surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/83,85,86,88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,85,86,88,89</a>]. However, it may be complicated by abscess formation, and there is no evidence of long-term efficacy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiotherapy is generally reserved for treatment of childhood hemangiomas associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. It is rarely considered a first line therapy because of its known effects on growth and the risk of secondary malignancy. It may provide some beneficial effects in reducing tumor size in settings in which resection is not technically feasible because of tumor location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interferon alfa-2a has been used in infants with life-threatening hemangiomas in extrahepatic sites, although success has not been uniform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Its efficacy for hepatic hemangiomas has not been well studied. Interferon probably works as an <span class=\"nowrap\">antiproliferative/antiangiogenic</span> agent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations regarding OCPs and pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks associated with use of oral contraceptives (OCP) or pregnancy are not well understood. There is insufficient evidence to conclusively link estrogens to the development or growth of hemangiomas. As a result, controversy exists as to whether patients with hemangiomas should be advised against pregnancy. Full-term pregnancies without complications have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>One of the largest reviews included 27 pregnancies in patients with hepatic hemangiomas ranging in size from 2.4 to 61 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hemangioma/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Enlargement occurred in 12 cases and spontaneous rupture was reported in one case with a hemangioma that was 10 cm in size. Intra-tumor hemorrhage occurred in one case and was successfully treated with arterial embolization. Maternal outcome was good in 23 cases and not mentioned in 3 cases. One patient died. Fetal outcome was good in 16 cases, not mentioned in 5, and there were 2 fetal deaths and 4 terminations. The authors conclude hemangiomas can be managed conservatively during pregnancy and vaginal delivery is acceptable as complications from lesions under 10 cm are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of hepatic hemangiomas have ranged from 0.4 to 20 percent. The highest estimates have been derived from autopsy studies, suggesting that these lesions are common in the general population. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemangiomas are typically discovered incidentally at laparotomy, autopsy, or during an imaging test performed for unrelated conditions. Lesions &gt;4 cm are more likely to cause symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic hemangiomas have characteristics that can suggest the diagnosis on ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging. A minority of lesions are atypical and may require multiple imaging tests to achieve a confident diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients, particularly those with lesions &lt;1.5 cm, but also including those with lesions &le;5 cm, can be reassured and observed without follow-up imaging, provided the diagnosis is certain. On the other hand, rapid growth of a hemangioma has been reported, justifying close radiologic follow-up of patients with lesions &gt;5 cm (eg, CT scan yearly), particularly those in a subcapsular location. In the absence of symptoms, the risk of bleeding is too low to justify prophylactic resection.
