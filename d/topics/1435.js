The early introduction of DMARDs has become standard of care, and depends upon early diagnosis<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such early diagnosis is facilitated by the 2010 American College of Rheumatology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACR)/European</span> League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The goals of DMARD use are not only to ameliorate the symptoms and signs of active RA, but also to prevent structural joint damage and avoid functional impairment or enable its restoration. The development of new antirheumatic therapies, including biologic and synthetic agents targeted against specific components of the immunoinflammatory system, has required the availability of instruments that permit the assessment of disease activity and the response to therapy. Regardless of whether patients are evaluated in the context of a clinical trial or longitudinal clinical practice, the successful application of DMARD therapy requires that the goals of therapy be specified in advance and that the specific choice of DMARDs be revisited on a regular basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Clinical indicators employed in the assessment of RA activity are discussed here. The roles of both individual variables (eg, swollen joint counts and acute phase reactant measurements) and composite indices for disease activity assessment are considered, as are definitions of remission and criteria for clinically significant responses. Although much of the discussion centers on clinical trial outcome measures, we also provide recommendations for clinical practice.</p><p>A number of other topic reviews are related to the discussion of RA disease activity and complement the information provided here.

Thus, reduction of clinical disease activity through prudent DMARD use is an essential therapeutic aim.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional impairment may relate to both active RA, manifested by symptoms such as pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, and to structural joint damage occurring as the consequence of previously active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/7,9,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,13-15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With few exceptions<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], clinically active RA and the processes leading to joint destruction are linked, such that damage usually progresses in the presence of active disease<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring disease activity at regular, short-term intervals (not to exceed three months when disease is active) and appropriate modifications of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy to establish and maintain control of disease result in improved radiographic and functional outcomes in patients with RA<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. To this end, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations on the management of RA provide a treatment strategy, including recommendations for an approach to the institution of various therapeutic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to disease-modifying therapy in RA can be assessed by use of one of several response criteria that allow for an assessment of the degree of disease activity that is present, the extent of improvement that has occurred, and whether a state of remission has been achieved. (See <a href=\"#H7361102\" class=\"local\">'Response criteria'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7361200\" class=\"local\">'Remission'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic goals are the achievement of remission (ie, the virtual absence of disease activity) or a state of low disease activity as the second-best option. These goals are consistent with the recommendations of an international task force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the majority of RA patients, the achievement of sustained disease remission is associated with the cessation of joint damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/8,18,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18,27-29</a>]. However, in the majority of patients with longstanding disease, remission may not be an achievable goal, and therefore low disease activity is an acceptable alternative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While some progression of damage and residual impairment of physical function may occur in association with low disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], a state of moderate disease activity, as defined by composite measures, is generally not acceptable, as it leads to much worse outcomes by comparison with low disease activity. Nevertheless, patient-specific factors and other risks need to be taken into account when adapting therapy to attain a good outcome. (See <a href=\"#H7361032\" class=\"local\">'Composite indices for disease activity assessment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The following sections describe individual elements that are assessed in order to determine RA activity, the concepts of composite indices and response criteria, and the definitions of low disease activity and remission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11511881\"><span class=\"h1\">INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES OF DISEASE ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common indicators of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) include the following measurements (reviewed in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen and tender joint counts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient and evaluator global assessments of disease activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (ESR, CRP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of morning stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p/><p>Additional measures, which partly reflect disease activity and partly reflect disease outcome, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures of function (eg, the Health Assessment Questionnaire)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health status measures (eg, the Short Form 36)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7360990\"><span class=\"h2\">Core sets of disease activity variables</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beginning in the 1990s, several groups defined core sets of disease activity variables. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), and a group of investigators representing both the World Health Organization (WHO) and International League of Associations of Rheumatology (ILAR) all published similar core sets of activity variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. The methods used to identify these variables were driven by clinical data and met several criteria for validity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>All three core sets include swollen and tender joint counts, patient assessment of pain, patient global assessment of disease activity, and a measure of the acute phase response. As an example, the ACR core data set includes a total of seven measures: three performed by the evaluator (swollen joint count, tender joint count, and global assessment of disease activity); three collected by patient self-report (functional status, pain, and global assessment of disease activity); and a laboratory measure (either an ESR or CRP). The ACR and <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/ILAR</span> core sets both include evaluator global assessments of disease activity and physical function. By contrast, in the EULAR core set, physical function is regarded as an outcome variable rather than a process variable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7360997\"><span class=\"h2\">Swollen and tender joint counts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joints are typically assessed according to two characteristics: 1) soft tissue swelling and effusion (the swollen joint count); and 2) pain on pressure or motion (the tender joint count). In general, neither the weighting of joints by their size (ie, the cartilage surface area) nor grading them by degree of swelling or tenderness confers validity and reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>The 28 joint count has become a standard for use in both clinical practice and clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. The 28 joint count excludes assessments of the foot and ankle joints, because the interpretation of swelling and tenderness in these joints is confounded frequently by disorders other than RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/40,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42,43</a>]. Although the 28 joint count has been criticized for leaving out assessment of the feet, it has been thoroughly validated and employed reliably in clinical trials and other analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. It is the basis of today's most frequently employed composite measures of disease activity. Importantly, employing a 28-joint count for determining levels of disease activity and response does not obviate the responsibility to also assess ankles and feet in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361004\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is usually measured by visual analog scales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>], which most often use horizontal 100 mm lines. Patients indicate their degree of pain (typically over the preceding week) by placing a mark between &quot;no pain&quot; (left end, 0 mm) and excruciating pain (right end, 100 mm). Alternatives to visual analog scales include numerical rating scales (ranging from 0 to 10 in steps of 1 or 0.5) and categorical scales (eg, 5-point Likert scales), both of which are also reliable and sensitive to change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361011\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient and evaluator global assessments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Global disease activity rated by the patient, the evaluator, or both (and termed, respectively, the PGA or EGA, as appropriate) is assessed in a similar manner using visual analog scales, numerical rating scales, or Likert scales. Measuring the PGA acknowledges the importance of patient-reported outcomes. Whereas the EGA typically integrates information from both subjective and objective variables, the PGA is considered a subjective measure, which is strongly weighted for pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Because patients are more likely than medically-trained evaluators to construe functional disability as a manifestation of active disease, and because medically-trained evaluators have greater context for comparison with other RA patients, PGAs are usually scored at higher levels than are EGAs.</p><p>The typical question asked of the patient for a PGA is: &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis has affected you, how do you feel your arthritis is today?&quot; This assessment is presumed to also take into account aspects of disease activity that might be less well appreciated by the clinician (eg, fatigue or sleep disturbances).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361018\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute phase reactants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute phase reactant levels, particularly the ESR and CRP, constitute the most objective disease activity measures. Acute phase reactant levels correlate well with both clinical disease activity measurements and radiographic progression of joint damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/6,10,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,51-54</a>]. The ESR and CRP are the two biomarkers used most widely to assess disease activity. These tests are widely available, relatively inexpensive, and reflective of the cascade of inflammatory events associated with active RA; the CRP in particular is well standardized. Measurements of individual components of this response, eg, levels of the interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, are not more useful in assessing RA activity and are prone to greater variation from laboratory to laboratory. Moreover, among these cytokines, only IL-6 can be consistently and reliably measured in patient sera.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361025\"><span class=\"h2\">Other variables</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other variables associated with disease activity include the duration of morning stiffness, degree of fatigue, and the reduction in functional capacity. Morning stiffness<strong> </strong>is not contained among the core set variables because of its higher variability and lower sensitivity to change compared with other measures. A variety of patient-reported instruments are available to measure levels of fatigue, including the <span class=\"nowrap\">vitality/fatigue</span> scales that constitute part of the short form (SF)-36. A specific measure for fatigue, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue measure, has been developed. More commonly, however, fatigue is assessed simply through the use of a visual analog scale.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361032\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPOSITE INDICES FOR DISEASE ACTIVITY ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The individual variables outlined above reflect major characteristics of the disease within the population of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as a whole. Given the heterogeneity of RA, however, the predominance of these indicators may be highly variable across individual patients, and may even vary with time within individual patients. As a result, the evaluation of a single core variable (eg, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) in patients with RA would not reflect accurately the full spectrum of the disease. In addition, the evaluation of all variables within core sets often leads to heterogeneous responses and substantial methodological problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/36-38,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38,55</a>]. Thus, &quot;composite&quot; indices combining several core set variables have been developed. Several composite indices are in common use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75446\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75446 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Formulas for calculating the indices vary in complexity, some are challenging to compute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/10,41,56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,41,56-59</a>]. The Disease Activity Score (DAS), its derivative (the DAS28), the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) are described in greater detail below. Interestingly, baseline disease activity by these composite scores, and especially disease activity after three months of therapy with DMARDs is highly predictive of disease activity at later points in time (one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] allowing to adopt treatment strategies that allow rapid, dynamic changes of therapeutic agents in patients who continue with high (or sometimes moderate) disease activity by three to six months from start of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361039\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease activity score (DAS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basis of the DAS was the clinician's decision to raise or lower disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) doses based on a largely qualitative assessment of disease activity, and reflected clinical practice in about 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Several features make the DAS challenging to use in clinical trial and practice settings. First, the DAS employs the Ritchie Articular Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], a measure with major shortcomings in terms of feasibility and reliability, to evaluate joint tenderness. Second, the DAS employs an extensive 44 joint count to record the number of swollen joints. Finally, once the data required to complete the DAS are accumulated, the formula for calculating the score is quite complex, using different weights for each of the variables as well as square roots or logarithmic transformations in the case of some (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75446\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75446 \">table 1</a>). In summary, the original DAS is complicated and not very user friendly, and therefore not ideally suited to wide use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361046\"><span class=\"h3\">DAS28 score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of the DAS was important because it provided a global summative and continuous score for disease activity assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A modification of the DAS, the DAS28, eliminated the grading of joints and reduced the number of joints evaluated to 28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/41,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,59</a>]; it has been widely used in clinical trials and in practice. A calculator for the DAS28 is available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-rheumatoid-arthritis-disease-activity-score-with-erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate-das28-esr-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p>Ranges of DAS28 scores that correspond to high, moderate, and low disease activity have been proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75446\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75446 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62663\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62663 \">figure 1</a>). High disease activity relates to DAS28 &gt;5.1, moderate to DAS28 of &gt;3.2 to 5.1, low disease activity is regarded in the range of 2.6 to 3.2. A cut-off point for &quot;remission&quot; has also been proposed (DAS28 &lt;2.6). However, nearly 15 percent of patients with DAS28 scores of 2.6 (the cut-point for remission) continue to have two or more swollen joints; some may have even more than 10 swollen joints yet still be categorized as in &quot;remission&quot; using this composite index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/11,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,61-63</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7361200\" class=\"local\">'Remission'</a> below.)</p><p>The DAS28 can be calculated using either the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP). Originally, these two variants were thought to be interchangeable, but this is not the case, and the cut-points for the various disease activity states have consistently been shown to be lower for DAS28-CRP than DAS28-ESR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. Indeed, to match the remission rates found using the SDAI (see <a href=\"#H7361060\" class=\"local\">'Simplified disease activity index (SDAI)'</a> below), the current cut-points would need to be lowered to 2.2 for the DAS28-ESR and to 1.9 for the DAS28-CRP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. At the same time, however, the issue with the residual joint activity in remission was only mitigated but is still substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The greater relative weight the DAS28 gives to acute phase measures can result in a disproportionately lower estimate of disease activity compared with other measures, such as the SDAI or CDAI (see <a href=\"#H7361060\" class=\"local\">'Simplified disease activity index (SDAI)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7361067\" class=\"local\">'Clinical disease activity index (CDAI)'</a> below) when used to assess disease activity in patients receiving agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> or inhibitors of the Janus kinases (JAK) that have more pronounced effects on acute phase reactants relative to their overall clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. As revealed by the formula of the DAS28, it also gives half as much weight to a swollen joint as it does to a tender joint, although both have a similar level of severity of inflammation.

The cutpoint for remission is 2.8 and that for low disease activity is 10. The advantage of the CDAI is that it facilitates immediate treatment decisions based entirely on clinical criteria and includes assessment of the joints, the principal &quot;target organ&quot; in RA. This attribute is useful in clinical trials and practice, since it circumvents the potential problem of lab to lab variation in the measurement of acute phase reactants. A calculator for the CDAI is available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-rheumatoid-arthritis-clinical-disease-activity-index-cdai-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>).</p><p>Since the CDAI does not incorporate measures of acute phase reactants, it presumably constitutes the most valid measure across all agents, including drugs that interfere directly with the acute phase reactants.

Such instruments, developed for generic use, are employed commonly in clinical trials, less often in clinical practice. The two physical function assessment tools used most frequently are the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/75-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-78</a>]. While the SF-36 is more complex (36 items), generic, and an instrument of health status, the HAQ was originally developed for RA, is shorter (20 items), and is much easier to calculate. In clinical practice, we therefore prefer the HAQ over the SF-36, while in clinical trials both scales are usually employed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361081\"><span class=\"h2\">Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complete HAQ is a comprehensive instrument designed to assess patient disability, discomfort, medication side effects, costs, and mortality. Of these components, only the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is used frequently in clinical trials and clinical practice. The HAQ-DI, a component of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core data set for the evaluation of RA disease activity and outcome, evaluates patients' ability to perform activities of daily living through their answers to 20 questions designed to assess upper or lower extremity use. These questions are organized into eight categories: dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each question is answered on a four-level scale of impairment ranging from 0 to 3: 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; and 3 = inability to do.</p><p>The final HAQ index, which ranges from 0 to 3, is the mean of scores from all eight categories. HAQ scores &lt;0.3 are considered normal, however, the mean HAQ of the population rises with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Higher HAQ scores indicate increasing disability. The minimal clinically important difference in serial HAQ scores has been suggested to be 0.22 on the group level for patients with RA. Several modifications of the HAQ have been employed in clinical trials and practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Although the primary influence on the HAQ is disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/9,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,76</a>], the score reflects both joint damage and disease activity. Therefore, results of the HAQ require careful interpretation when used for disease activity assessment, as<strong> </strong>the irreversible, damage-related component of disability as assessed by HAQ increases with the degree of joint damage and with disease duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Thus, it has been proposed that the activity-related HAQ (ACT-HAQ) should be distinguished from its damage-related component (DAM-HAQ).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361088\"><span class=\"h2\">The short form-36</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The short form (SF)-36 is a patient-reported instrument designed to assess overall health status; it is not disease-specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The SF-36, usually utilized to measure patients' quality of life, has been validated in numerous diseases, including RA. The instrument consists of 36 questions organized into 8 domains: physical function, physical role, general health, bodily pain, mental health, social function, <span class=\"nowrap\">vitality/fatigue,</span> and emotional role. Data from these eight domains can be summarized into two categories: a physical component score and a mental component score. SF-36 results are particularly useful for comparing quality of life across cohorts of patients with different diseases, but also correlate well with other measures of RA activity. Increasing SF-36 scores are indicative of improving health status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361095\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT-REPORTED INSTRUMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several self-reported instruments are available for the assessment of RA activity. These include the <strong>R</strong>heumatoid<strong> A</strong>rthritis<strong> D</strong>isease<strong> A</strong>ctivity<strong> I</strong>ndex (RADAI), the <strong>R</strong>apid<strong> A</strong>ssessment<strong> </strong>of<strong> D</strong>isease<strong> A</strong>ctivity in<strong> R</strong>heumatology (RADAR), and a modification of the <strong>R</strong>outine <strong>A</strong>ssessment of <strong>P</strong>atient <strong>I</strong>ndex <strong>D</strong>ata (RAPID3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32342639\"><span class=\"h2\">RADAI and RADAR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RADAI encompasses five items, including patient-assessed joint counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. A major detraction of the RADAI, similar to that of the Disease Activity Score (DAS), is the need for a calculator. In contrast, the RADAR is a brief, two-page questionnaire that includes six items related to arthritis symptoms, physical function, work impact, psychological status, social health, and satisfaction with health status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Although the use of patient-reported indices of disease activity such as the RADAI or RADAR is appealing in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition associated with large personal dimensions, these instruments are rarely used in clinical trials and almost never in clinical practice. The patient-reported instruments used most often in clinical trials are global assessments of disease activity (eg, visual analog scales), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores, and the short form (SF)-36.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32342654\"><span class=\"h2\">RAPID3 score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RAPID3, as an expansion of the RAPID, constitutes an index that is based upon patient self-reported outcomes only and is simple to administer.

However, in established disease where functional impairment, to a large extent, is irreversible due to the accrued joint damage, the RAPID3 likely does not correlate well with the actual clinical improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2725325592\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPOSITE BIOMARKER SCORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) assay and score has been developed which is suggested to reflect disease activity using a blood test based on a variety of biomarkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. It is not clear when and how to use this blood test, since while it reflects clinical disease activity, it may be misleading in patients with infections or other comorbidities, and further study needs to be done in this regard. Indeed, one analysis revealed that the MBDA may respond differently depending upon the drug used, despite similar levels of clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Since it shows good correlation with clinical activity, clinical assessment remains the gold standard and such tests, if sufficiently validated in various populations, may be useful for research studies but do not replace clinical assessment.

Such criteria can be applied to large numbers of patients in the context of clinical trials, and also in gauging the treatment responses of individual patients over time. Response criteria may involve either the comparison of a patient's activity score to a baseline value for that same patient, or the achievement of a certain disease activity state (eg, either remission or low disease activity).</p><p>The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria (see <a href=\"#H7361109\" class=\"local\">'ACR response criteria'</a> below) remain standard outcome measures for clinical trials. The ACR-N response measure (see <a href=\"#H7361130\" class=\"local\">'ACR-N response'</a> below) has been used in several trials, but it is not as standard a tool for assessment of response in clinical trials, as is the classical ACR response.</p><p>The Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) are response criteria that are used increasingly in clinical trials reporting and are useful in clinical practice (see <a href=\"#H7361165\" class=\"local\">'SDAI and CDAI response criteria'</a> below). The SDAI and CDAI allow for monitoring of overall disease activity as well as determination of states such as remission. Also, SDAI and CDAI responses are a simple calculation of change, can be done easily in clinical practice and are even simpler than the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria (see <a href=\"#H7361144\" class=\"local\">'EULAR response criteria'</a> below), which require a combination of achieving a change and a disease state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361109\"><span class=\"h2\">ACR response criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An early attempt to define minimal response requirements was provided by the Paulus criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. These criteria formed the basis for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], which (in their initial iteration) outlined the variables of a 20 percent improvement. The ACR20 response, a standard measure for many clinical trials performed since 1995, is defined as improvement of at least 20 percent in the number of both swollen and tender joints, as well as at least 20 percent improvement in three or more of the five remaining core set variables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64036 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The categorical response criteria embodied in the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 measure the frequency of benefit (ie, the proportion of patients receiving a certain treatment that achieve a defined response). In contrast, measuring the mean or median ACR-N (N for numeric) improvement facilitates an estimation of the cumulative magnitude of benefit that may be anticipated for a typical patient relative to the baseline disease activity. Both types of measures are useful for certain situations, and in many cases the information they provide are complementary. The hybrid-ACR response requires further validation. These measures are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361116\"><span class=\"h3\">ACR20 response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ACR20 response discriminates accurately between the effects of active medications and those of placebo. However, because of improvements in RA treatment, the ACR20 is no longer considered an optimal measure of clinically meaningful change: patients who achieve only ACR20 responses may still have substantial disease burdens from active RA. Moreover, the ACR20 has other potential weaknesses in some applications: 1) it does not measure directly any responses &gt;20 percent in magnitude over baseline; 2) it characterizes the percentage of patients who meet this cutoff, rather than the response of the average patient; and 3) it measures the change in patients' disease activity compared with baseline, but does not quantify disease activity at the end of the period of interest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361123\"><span class=\"h3\">ACR50 and ACR70 responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More ambitious criteria for improvements in disease activity have been proposed; namely, the ACR50 and ACR70 responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>], corresponding to 50 and 70 percent improvements, respectively. In contrast to ACR20 responses, patients notice dramatic differences following the achievement of ACR50 and ACR70 responses. In clinical trials of biologic agents, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or various combinations, the percentage of patients achieving ACR20, 50, and 70 responses with the study agent (or combination of agents) have been on the order of 40 to 80 percent, 25 to 60 percent, and 10 to 40 percent, respectively. An ACR70 response corresponds well with achievement of a low disease activity state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7361130\"><span class=\"h3\">ACR-N response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>However, as categorical variables, the ACR50 and ACR70 suffer from some of the same drawbacks as the ACR20. Thus, some investigators have attempted to express changes in the ACR core set variables as a continuous measure. One such effort, the ACR-N, judges changes in the following three variables: swollen joint count, tender joint count, and the median of the 5 remaining core set variables, using the 0 to 100 percent improvement that is the smallest among these three measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The identification of remission is hampered practically by the presence of irreversible joint damage, which may lead to abnormalities confused with residual disease activity. In a similar manner, comorbidities such as fibromyalgia or osteoarthritis may confound the designation of remission.</p><p>Because progressive joint destruction may occur and function may decline, albeit at comparatively slow rates, when disease activity persists even at a low level, stringent criteria are important as a means of distinguishing remission from low disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/8,11,25,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,25,98</a>].

Among them, the most often measured are: swollen and tender joint counts, pain, patient and evaluator global assessments, acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), duration of morning stiffness, fatigue, measures of function (eg, the Health Assessment Questionnaire), and of health status (eg, the Short Form 36). (See <a href=\"#H11511881\" class=\"local\">'Individual variables of disease activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various sets of individual measures have been characterized that are useful for assessing the efficacy of drug treatment of RA. These core sets include those developed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), and World Health Organization <span class=\"nowrap\">(WHO)/International</span> League of Associations of Rheumatology (ILAR). (See <a href=\"#H7360990\" class=\"local\">'Core sets of disease activity variables'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Composite indices of disease activity (Simplified Disease Activity Index [SDAI], and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI]) represent indices that provide a timely aid to clinical decision making. The Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) is a good score for higher disease activity, but not sufficiently stringent nor reproducible across different agents when aiming at a good outcome such as remission. The SDAI and CDAI are also easier to calculate than the DAS or DAS28 and define remission more stringently. Measures that do not include joint counts may not reflect disease activity sufficiently in patients with longstanding disease and may not be as well correlated with joint damage as the other indices. (See <a href=\"#H7361032\" class=\"local\">'Composite indices for disease activity assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responses of groups of patients to treatment in clinical trials may be based on a categorical criterion (eg, an ACR50 response, a EULAR good response, or a <span class=\"nowrap\">CDAI/SDAI</span> major response) or the mean change of a numeric index of disease activity (eg, DAS, SDAI, CDAI, ACR-N [N for numeric], or Hybrid ACR). DAS, SDAI, and CDAI provide measures of actual disease activity, while the ACR-N and Hybrid ACR represent improvements from a series of baseline values. (See <a href=\"#H7361102\" class=\"local\">'Response criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With some preparation and minor modifications of the usual work flow in clinical settings, all of the variables comprising core data sets for RA activity assessment can be collected in a standard fashion: 1) Tender and swollen joint counts can be obtained by any health professional with appropriate training; 2) visual analogue scales for patient and evaluator global assessments of disease activity require less than one minute to complete (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50461 \">figure 2</a>); 3) routine laboratory testing of the ESR, CRP, or both is inexpensive and widely available; 4) HAQ-DI assessments may be completed by patients in the waiting room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest use of the CDAI to help guide treatment decisions by clinicians caring for patients with RA. The CDAI is calculated as a simple numerical sum of swollen and tender joints (using the 28 joint count), the patient global assessment, and the evaluator global assessments. It can be used for clinical decision-making purposes even in the absence of information about acute phase reactants. It is easy to obtain and calculate, despite the inclusion of formal joint counts.<strong> </strong>The ESR or CRP, if available, may be useful in validating the clinician's impressions based on the CDAI or other composite index of choice. (See <a href=\"#H7361067\" class=\"local\">'Clinical disease activity index (CDAI)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitions of remission that may be used in clinical trials and clinical practice, respectively, have been developed by a joint committee of the ACR and the EULAR and meanwhile have been widely validated. (See <a href=\"#H7361200\" class=\"local\">'Remission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal management of patients with RA and some degree of active disease requires serial assessments. We suggest intervals not greater than every three months, in line with the recommendations on treating RA to targeting remission or low disease activity.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-activity-in-clinical-trials-and-clinical-practice/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Combe B, Landewe R, Lukas C, et al.
