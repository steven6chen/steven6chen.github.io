Affected patients have a worse prognosis than patients with SSc who are free of pulmonary involvement. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis of SSc-associated ILD are discussed here. The treatment of SSc-associated ILD, the evaluation and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension and other pulmonary complications of SSc are discussed separately.

The type of cutaneous involvement has some correlation with the risk for ILD, as described below.

Patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc are at an increased risk of developing ILD early in the course of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited cutaneous SSc is characterized by skin sclerosis restricted to the hands, distal extremities, and, to a lesser extent, the face and neck. Patients with limited cutaneous SSc are less likely to develop ILD early in the course of disease, but may develop ILD as a late manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of ILD in patients with SSc varies based upon population studied and definition of ILD. In one study of 779 patients with SSc, 48 percent of those with diffuse cutaneous SSc and 26 percent of those with limited cutaneous SSc were found on HRCT to have ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In a separate multi-ethnic cohort study of 203 patients with SSc, early development of ILD was associated with African-American ethnicity, higher skin score and serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, hypothyroidism, and cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Anticentromere antibodies were protective against ILD, as demonstrated previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early ILD is frequently asymptomatic. The most common symptoms of SSc-associated ILD are fatigue, breathlessness (ie, exertional dyspnea initially), and dry cough. Chest pain is infrequent, and hemoptysis is rare. </p><p>While most patients have cutaneous stigmata of SSc at the time ILD is identified, occasional patients present first with ILD and are subsequently found to have SSc based on the presence of findings such as Raynaud phenomenon, sclerodactyly, positive autoantibodies (eg, antinuclear antibody, antitopoisomerase [anti-Scl70]), or abnormal nailfold capillary microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F94667\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94667 \">figure 1</a>).

Clubbing is uncommon. Signs of cor pulmonale can be seen with advanced ILD, but are more commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension, which may occur as a separate process or in association with ILD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94894947\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSc-associated ILD is usually suspected when a patient with known SSc develops dyspnea, cough, auscultatory crackles, or abnormalities on pulmonary function testing (PFTs) or the chest radiograph. The evaluation of suspected ILD in a patient with SSc is similar to that of other patients with suspected ILD. However, a lung biopsy is rarely needed to secure a diagnosis of SSc-ILD. A general diagnostic approach to the patient with ILD is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Clinical evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Investigations evaluating suspected SSc-associated ILD are designed to characterize the type and severity of ILD and to exclude the possibility that another lung disease or extra-pulmonary process is etiologic, such as infection, heart failure, drug-induced lung disease, heart failure, or recurrent aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of characteristic autoantibodies supports the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis and may indicate an increased likelihood of specific clinical manifestations, such as ILD, but none are diagnostic of ILD. As an example, anti-topoisomerase I (also known as anti-Scl-70), which is typically obtained as part of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected SSc, is associated with an increased risk for SSc-associated ILD (sensitivity 45 percent, specificity 81 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The role and availability of specific laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of SSc is discussed separately.

However, these tests are not commercially available at present, and their clinical utility in the evaluation and management of SSc-associated ILD is uncertain.</p><p>Anticentromere antibodies (ACA), which are common among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to SSc, are rarely associated with ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PFTs are performed in the majority of patients with SSC at the time of initial diagnosis to determine whether SSc has affected the lungs and to what extent. Subsequently, PFTs are performed annually or sooner, to evaluate any new onset of dyspnea, cough, or radiographic abnormality. The pattern of abnormalities on PFTs can help to differentiate among the various types of SSc lung involvement.

A decrease in the DLCO may be the first PFT abnormality seen in SSc-associated ILD, but is nonspecific; other processes (eg, pulmonary hypertension, cigarette smoking, thromboembolic disease) can also cause a decrease in DLCO. Among patients with SSc-associated ILD, the decrease in DLCO is usually proportionate to the decrease in lung volumes. Furthermore, the decrease in DLCO correlates with the severity of ILD detected by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and is a predictor of poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

It is used as a measure of submaximal exercise performance in a variety of pulmonary diseases (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension). Assessment of pulse oxygen desaturation can be problematic in patients with SSc due to Raynaud phenomenon and poor finger perfusion. If the appropriate attachment is available, measurement of pulse oxygen saturation using an earlobe clip may be more effective. Desaturation on ambulation is common to both ILD and pulmonary hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The value of the 6MWT is somewhat limited in SSc, as the distance walked does not discriminate well between patients with lung involvement and those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The classic radiographic features of established SSc-associated ILD consist of symmetric, reticular, or ground glass opacities. These are usually most pronounced at the lung bases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">HRCT scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thin section (3 mm or less) HRCT scanning of the lung has revolutionized the evaluation of ILD. This technique can demonstrate the character and distribution of fine structural abnormalities not visible on chest radiographs. Prone images are often obtained in addition to the usual supine images to differentiate between increased density due to ILD and dependent atelectasis at the posterior lung bases.

The earliest HRCT change is usually a narrow, often ill-defined, subpleural crescent of increased density in the posterior (dependent) segments of the lower lobes.

In a series of 28 patients with SSc-associated ILD, six had centrilobular fibrosis on biopsy. In these patients, centrilobular fibrosis was associated with pathologic evidence of recurrent aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Thus, for most patients these tests are not necessary. However, for patients with atypical features, such as fever, productive cough, hemoptysis, peripheral blood eosinophilia, or focal consolidation on chest imaging, bronchoscopy with BAL may be indicated.

However, the results from a multicenter clinical trial argue against the routine use of BAL to identify active or progressive ILD (ie, alveolitis).

Within the classification of NSIP, variable amounts of mononuclear cell infiltration and alveolar septal fibrosis can be seen.

ILD occurs in about 50 to 66 percent of patients with MCTD. Differentiation of ILD due to SSc or MCTD is based on the pattern of other clinical manifestations and the presence of dominant autoantibodies to U1 RNP.

Either of these processes can present with a reduction in diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) that appears greater than what would be expected based in the reduction in lung volume or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) abnormalities. Identification of PH contributor to dyspnea or a low DLCO is dependent on finding elevated pulmonary artery pressures on Doppler echocardiography followed by confirmation on right heart catheterization.

The prevalence approaches 50 percent of patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (extensive skin involvement proximal to the wrists, particularly over the proximal limbs and trunk). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-complications-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary complications of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Types of pulmonary involvement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early SSc-associated ILD may be asymptomatic. When symptoms develop, fatigue, breathlessness (ie, exertional dyspnea initially), and dry cough are most commonly reported. Chest pain is infrequent, and hemoptysis is rare. Bibasilar, fine inspiratory crackles (ie, &quot;Velcro&quot; rales) are the most characteristic finding of ILD; clubbing is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of suspected ILD in a patient with SSc is similar to that of other patients with suspected ILD and is designed to characterize the type and severity of ILD and to exclude the possibility that another lung disease or extra-pulmonary process is etiologic. The majority of patients will require pulmonary function testing, a chest radiograph, and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). (See <a href=\"#H94894947\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Clinical evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) are hallmarks of ILD and are usually proportionate in terms of changes from the percent predicted values. A decreased DLCO without a concomitant decrease in lung volumes can be seen in early ILD, although this latter pattern is more typical of pulmonary arterial hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiographs are relatively insensitive for the detection of early ILD, so most patients also need an HRCT. Performing HRCT in both supine and prone positions is important as the early abnormalities in SSc-associated ILD are usually found in the dependent lung areas; prone scanning is used to exclude the possibility of dependent atelectasis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'HRCT scanning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical HRCT finding is a peripheral, bibasilar distribution of ground glass opacities, consistent with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). With more advanced disease, reticular opacities increase and traction bronchiectasis becomes apparent, suggesting volume loss. The HRCT pattern in patients with the less common usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern is similar, and may include honeycombing. Centrilobular fibrosis is a rare pattern that is associated with patchy ground glass or consolidative opacities with a central distribution on HRCT scanning. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'HRCT scanning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with SSc, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is not necessary. However, for patients with atypical features, such as fever, productive cough, hemoptysis, peripheral blood eosinophilia, or focal consolidation on chest imaging, bronchoscopy with BAL may be indicated.
