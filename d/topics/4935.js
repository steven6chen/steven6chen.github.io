The advantages of aerosolized therapy include delivery of medication directly to the site of action, potentially faster onset of action, and reduced systemic availability to minimize adverse effects of the medication.</p><p>The types and function of devices available for delivery of therapeutic aerosols are reviewed here. The education of patients regarding optimal inhaler technique and the role of these medications in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are discussed separately.

Some breath actuated pMDIs (available in some countries outside the United States) overcome the problem of incoordination between actuation and inhalation that is commonly observed with pMDIs. Among nebulizers, three basic types have been developed, jet (also known as pneumatic), ultrasonic, and mesh. Jet nebulizer systems are typically less portable than pMDIs and DPIs. In the past, nebulizers were considered more expensive delivery devices; however, in some settings, hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) formulations of pMDIs may be more expensive than the solutions used in a nebulizer. </p><p>Inhalation (or aerosol) therapy can be employed with a range of medications and devices. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators for chronic obstructive lung diseases (eg, asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled glucocorticoids for asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, and COPD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled antibiotics for prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway secretion modifying agents for cystic fibrosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerosol delivery of drugs (eg, opiates, insulin) may be used to treat some nonrespiratory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]</p><p/><p>The advantages and disadvantages to each of the different types of aerosol delivery devices are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71527 \">table 1</a>). The available evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggests equivalence among nebulizers, pMDIs, and DPIs for delivery of beta agonists and glucocorticoids when used correctly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>]. Thus, for spontaneously breathing patients without a tracheostomy, the selection of an aerosol delivery device is usually based upon the preference and convenience of the clinician and patient, the ability of the patient to use the device correctly, the durability of the device, and the cost of therapy rather than a clear superiority of one device over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in a few select situations, choice of device is determined by drug formulation, as some formulations require a particular delivery device, and patient interface factors, such as presence of a tracheotomy or mechanical ventilation.</p><p>The proper technique for using aerosol devices varies from one device to another and is a key component of optimal drug deposition and the desired therapeutic response. Understanding the correct use of aerosol delivery devices and providing patient education is a shared responsibility among all health care professionals participating in asthma or COPD management (eg, physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, and pharmacists) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Inhaler technique for pMDIs and DPIs is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All the commonly employed aerosol delivery devices can be used to deliver medication to spontaneously breathing patients who can inhale orally. Only nebulizers and pMDIs can be used in patients who are intubated or have a tracheostomy; DPIs are not designed for use in these patients and adapters to connect SMIs in the ventilator circuit are not commercially available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339815\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESSURIZED METERED DOSE INHALERS (pMDI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pMDI consists of a pressurized canister, a metering valve and stem, and a mouthpiece actuator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62613 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The canister contains the drug suspended in a pressurized mixture of propellants, surfactants, preservatives, flavoring agents, and dispersal agents. Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants have replaced the previously used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The medication-propellant mixture is released from the pMDI canister through the metering valve and stem into an actuator boot. Lung deposition ranges between 10 and 40 percent of the nominal dose in adults and is very technique-dependent. Some newer generation HFA-pMDIs have been formulated as ethanolic solutions, and they produce a finer aerosol spray with greater peripheral lung deposition and improved efficacy of drug delivery compared with their CFC-pMDI counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

Some combinations of long-acting beta agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a></span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=olodaterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olodaterol</a>)</span> are available in a pMDI. Inhalers combining long-acting beta agonists, long acting muscarinic antagonist, and inhaled glucocorticoids may soon be available (triple therapy). The correct techniques for priming and using a pMDI, cleaning the actuator, determining when the canister is empty, and deciding when to use a spacer or chamber device are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Difficulty precisely coordinating device actuation with inhalation leads to poor drug delivery, suboptimal disease control, and increased inhaler use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Such problems might be overcome by employing a <span class=\"nowrap\">spacer/valved</span> holding chamber or breath-actuated pMDI. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spacer or valved holding chamber</strong> &ndash; A pMDI can be used with a spacer or valved holding chamber (VHC) to overcome problems related to incoordination between actuation and inhalation. Spacer devices employ three basic designs: the open tube, the reservoir or VHC, and the reverse-flow design, in which the pMDI, placed close to the mouth, is fired in the direction away from the patient; adding a one-way valve creates a VHC. The use of these devices to improve aerosol delivery is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults#H62570469\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;, section on 'Spacers and holding chambers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breath-actuated inhalers</strong> &ndash; Breath-actuated pMDI are no longer commercially available in the United States. The efficacy of breath-actuated pMDIs matches the results with pMDIs in patients who are able to use pMDIs effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in patients with incoordination of inhalation with device actuation, breath actuated inhalers can improve efficacy of drug responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339674\"><span class=\"h1\">DRY POWDER INHALERS (DPI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) create medication aerosols by drawing air through a dose of powdered medication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57922 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. DPIs vary in the use of carrier molecules, internal resistance to airflow, threshold inspiratory flow needed for deaggregation of powder, particle size, and susceptibility to clumping in high ambient humidity. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carrier molecules</strong> &ndash; The micronized particles are either in the form of loose aggregates or they are bound to larger carrier particles (usually lactose or glucose). To facilitate deposition in the lungs, drug particles are deagglomerated during inhalation. In DPIs that contain drug particles blended with carrier lactose particles, turbulent energy created in the inhalation channel of the DPI by the interaction of inspiratory airflow with the resistance of the DPI dissociates the drug particles from the carrier particles. This turbulent energy produces a pressure change that breaks up (deaggregates) the formulation and entrains the deaggregated drug particles in the inspiratory airflow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The magnitude of the pressure change depends on the strength of the respiratory muscles, the degree of patient effort (ie, the force of the inhalation), and to a much lesser extent on disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Internal resistance to airflow</strong> &ndash; The internal resistance to airflow varies among DPI over a broad range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The turbulent energy created during inhalation is the product of the patient&rsquo;s inhalation flow multiplied by the DPI&rsquo;s resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, for a set energy, a DPI with a high resistance will require a lower inhalation flow than a DPI with a lower resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In general, as the patient's inspiratory effort increases, the flow through a given device increases and this translates into more effective aerosolization, reduced agglomeration of the particles, and a greater fine particle dose (FPD). DPIs with a high resistance tend to produce greater lung deposition than those with a lower resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], but the clinical significance of this is not known. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Threshold inspiratory flow</strong> &ndash; For each DPI there is a minimum turbulent energy that must be achieved for sufficient deaggregation of the powder during an inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Young (pre-school) children with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] may have problems achieving minimum flows through some DPIs, especially if inhalation flow is reduced during exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Particle size</strong> &ndash; DPIs produce aerosols in which most of the drug particles are in the respirable range; however, the distribution of particle sizes differs significantly among the various DPIs. These devices are either single-dose or multiple-dose. Multi-dose DPIs either contain a bulk formulation in a reservoir that is metered by the patient during use, or they contain pre-metered factory dispensed doses packaged inside blisters within the device. The single dose devices require the patient or caregiver to load a capsule of drug with each treatment, whereas the multiple dose devices typically contain a month&rsquo;s supply of drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Humidity</strong> &ndash; High ambient humidity produces clumping of the powder, creating larger particles that are not as effectively aerosolized. DPI devices that use individually packaged capsules protect the powder from humidity and limit this effect. Patients should be instructed to exhale before inhaling through their DPI device. They should not exhale into the device, but rather exhale into the room. Also, any humidity that is introduced into the device will affect delivery of subsequent doses, especially for DPIs of the reservoir type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For this reason, DPIs should be stored in a cool dry place. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The effect of humidity and the need for a tight seal for breath actuation makes all DPIs <strong>inefficient</strong> for use in patients with a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube.</p><p/><p>Examples of medications available in a DPI include several inhaled glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78011 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68143 \">table 4</a>), long-acting beta agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indacaterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indacaterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72467 \">table 2</a>), and the inhaled anticholinergic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aclidinium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aclidinium</a>, glycopyrronium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a>).

When an SMI is manually primed (rotation of the lower half of the device compresses a spring), a measured amount of drug solution is drawn up into the dosing system. Pressing a button releases the spring, and the buildup of pressure forces the liquid through a nozzle structure within a uniblock that has two narrow outlet channels etched using microchip technology. The two jets of solution converge and the impact generates a soft mist aerosol for approximately 1.2 seconds. </p><p>The SMI aerosol has a high fine particle fraction, a low velocity, and more sustained duration than a pMDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The device has a dose indicator. Once the dose indicator reaches the red zone it alerts the patient that approximately 30 doses remain in the device. The device locks after all the doses have been actuated. </p><p>The SMI technology achieves a two-to-three fold higher pulmonary deposition than a pMDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Accordingly, the efficacy of a given dose of medication is higher when administered by SMI compared with conventional pMDIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Depending on geographic location, a variety of bronchodilators are available via SMI, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>, combination <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-and-albuterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium-albuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a>, combination <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-and-olodaterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium-olodaterol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olodaterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olodaterol</a> alone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NEBULIZERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three basic types of nebulizer devices are jet (also known as pneumatic), ultrasonic, and mesh.

Jet nebulizers are often considered interchangeable. However, differences in performance among nebulizers produced by various manufacturers have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Some nebulizers deliver the dose of medication in a shorter time, while others deliver a more accurate dose or have less drug wastage. These differences may not be important for delivery of inhaled bronchodilators, but may be significant for more expensive medication formulations where precise dosing is required. (See <a href=\"#H24790161\" class=\"local\">'Nebulizers for specific medications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Enhanced nebulizer designs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339577\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The operation of a jet nebulizer requires an air compressor or a pressurized gas supply (eg, compressed air, oxygen), which acts as the driving force for liquid atomization. Compressed gas is delivered as a jet through a small orifice, generating a region of negative pressure above the medication reservoir. The solution to be aerosolized is first entrained, or pulled into the gas stream (Venturi effect), and then sheared into a liquid film. This film is unstable, and rapidly breaks into droplets due to surface tension forces.</p><p>A baffle placed in the aerosol stream allows formation of smaller droplets and recycling of larger droplets into the liquid reservoir.

The respirable dose is a function of the mass output of the nebulizer and the size of the droplets produced. Droplet size is usually reported as mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), which is the median diameter around which the mass of the aerosol is equally divided. Droplet size should be 2 to 5 &micro;m for airway deposition (eg, bronchodilator administration) and 1 to 2 &micro;m or smaller for parenchymal deposition (eg, drugs intended for absorption into the bloodstream such as pulmonary vasodilators).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nebulization time</strong> &ndash; Nebulization time, the time required to deliver a dose of medication, is determined by the volume of drug to be delivered and the flow of the driving gas into the nebulizer. The larger the volume and the lower the flow, the longer the nebulization time. Nebulization time is an important determinant of patient compliance with completing a full dose in the outpatient setting. In addition, a reduction in nebulization time may decrease the need for clinical supervision in hospitalized or emergently-treated patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During nebulization, the solution within the nebulizer becomes increasingly concentrated as water evaporates from the solution. Thus, on a per breath basis, more medication is delivered late in the course of a treatment. Patients should be encouraged to continue the treatment until there is no further pooling of medication in the bottom of the reservoir; reservoir sputtering is a good sign that the treatment is complete. Continuing treatment after sputtering is of limited value.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dead volume</strong> &ndash; The volume of medication trapped inside the nebulizer, and therefore not available for inhalation, is referred to as the dead volume of the device. The dead volume is typically in the range of 1 to 3 mL. Increasing the amount of solution within the nebulizer (the fill volume) reduces the proportion of the dose lost as dead volume. Although nebulizer output increases with a greater fill volume, this also results in an increase in nebulization time. Considering both factors, an initial nebulizer fill volume of 3 to 6 mL is typically used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The maximum fill volume of the nebulizer is manufacturer-determined; most do not exceed 5 mL, but some accept a volume as great as 10 mL. Unit dose ampules of bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>) are typically 2.5 to 3 mL, which may not be ideal in terms of the proportion of dead volume to the total dose.

When combining drug solutions in the nebulizer to minimize the time required for treatment, it is important to avoid a drug volume that exceeds the labeled maximum volume of the nebulizer and to avoid any incompatibility issues of the drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Driving gas</strong> &ndash; Increasing the flow of the driving gas results in an increase in nebulized output and a reduction in particle size.

A common feature of these devices is their ability to generate aerosols with a high fine-particle fraction, which results in more efficient drug delivery compared to conventional nebulizers.</p><p>Examples of mesh nebulizers include the eFlow (Pari), Aeroneb Solo and Aeroneb Go (Aerogen), <span class=\"nowrap\">MicroAIR/NE-U22</span> (OMRON), and the I-neb (Respironics) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87397 \">picture 3</a>).

Mesh nebulizers usually deliver the medication dose more quickly than jet nebulizers and could reduce the duration of each nebulizer treatment. However, the speed of medication delivery is influenced by the position of the nebulizer. Under laboratory conditions, the Omron vibrating mesh nebulizer has a comparable drug delivery to a conventional jet nebulizer only when the Omron is in a vertical position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The time to deliver the same dose is three times longer when the Omron is in the horizontal position, rather than vertical or slightly tilted. </p><p>Blockage of the minute apertures with drug particles, especially when suspensions are aerosolized, can impair performance. Thus, manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations for cleaning the device should be followed meticulously. Cleaning is required after each treatment, and more extensive disinfection or sterilization needs to be performed on a regular basis. One study reported that the Aerogen Solo mesh nebulizer was often randomly interrupted with a wide range of retained volumes, so the chamber should be checked to ensure that the full dose has been delivered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339430\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonic nebulizers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonic nebulizers consist of a power unit and transducer, with or without an electric fan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/38,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,69</a>]. The power unit converts electrical energy to high-frequency ultrasonic waves. A piezoelectric element in the transducer vibrates at the same frequency as the applied wave. Ultrasonic waves are transmitted to the surface of the solution to create an aerosol.

Two systems are available for delivery of nebulized medication: either a mask can be placed over the tracheostomy opening or the nebulizer chamber can be attached to the tracheostomy tube using a T-piece made of ventilator tubing and a connector. The T-piece approach is preferred because more aerosol medication is directed into the tracheostomy tube.</p><p>For delivery of a pMDI aerosol, the canister is removed from its usual plastic actuator and inserted into an <span class=\"nowrap\">actuator/spacer</span> that is attached by T-shaped connector to the tracheostomy tube. This <span class=\"nowrap\">actuator/spacer</span> is the same as that used for patients on mechanical ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53295\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53295 \">picture 6</a>). The caregiver actuates the pMDI into the spacer and the patient inhales the aerosol through the tracheostomy tube.</p><p>Adaptors have not been developed for effective administration of medication from DPIs into tracheostomy tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanically ventilated patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors affect aerosol delivery during mechanical ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64944 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/89-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-100</a>]. One major factor is that humidification of inhaled gas decreases aerosol deposition by approximately 40 percent due to increased particle drug deposition in the ventilator circuit. For this reason, increased dosage of medication is often required to achieve a therapeutic effect in mechanically ventilated patients.</p><p>Inhaled medications can be delivered to patients receiving mechanical ventilation using either a pMDI or a nebulizer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].

The size, shape, and design of these actuators have a major impact on drug delivery to the patient. A pMDI with a chamber results in a four- to six-fold greater delivery of aerosol than MDI actuation into a connector attached directly to the endotracheal tube, or into an in-line device that lacks a chamber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. When using a pMDI during mechanical ventilation, it is important to synchronize actuation with inspiratory airflow to optimize drug delivery. Properly used, a pMDI may deliver a more consistent dose than a nebulizer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>The following technique has been proposed for using pMDIs in mechanically ventilated adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the pMDI vigorously</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place canister in the actuator of a cylindrical spacer situated in the inspiratory limb of ventilator circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53295\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53295 \">picture 6</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Actuate the pMDI once only with the onset of inspiration by the ventilator</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat actuations after 15 seconds until the total dose is delivered</p><p/><p>Helium-oxygen mixtures affect aerosol deposition, and in vitro modeling has reported a 50 percent increase in deposition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> from a pMDI during mechanical ventilation when heliox was used as the driving gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. However, heliox can interfere with the functioning of flow sensors and oxygen levels when delivered through some ventilators, and care must be taken if this approach is employed with a ventilator that is not approved for heliox administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/106-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">106-108</a>].

Delivery of a large tidal volume, use of an end-inspiratory pause, and use of a slow inspiratory flow affect aerosol delivery by jet nebulizer but <strong>not</strong> by a pMDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Nebulizer performance can be optimized by placing the nebulizer 30 cm from the endotracheal tube, rather than at the Y-piece, because the inspiratory ventilator tubing acts as a spacer. In a simulation model, delivery of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> via mesh nebulizer was two to four times greater than with a jet nebulizer, and placement of the mesh nebulizer in the ventilator tubing on the ventilator side of the humidifier, rather than closer to the patient, increased drug delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. </p><p>Operating the nebulizer only during inspiration is more efficient for aerosol delivery compared with continuous aerosol generation throughout the respiratory cycle. When a breath-actuated nebulizer is used, the delivered dose increases by more than five-fold. In addition, when the humidifier is bypassed the delivered dose increases by a factor of nearly four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Disadvantages of jet nebulizer use during mechanical ventilation include circuit contamination due to interrupting the ventilator tubing circuit, decreased ability of the patient to trigger the ventilator, and the associated increases in tidal volume and airway pressure due to nebulizer flow. Valved T-piece devices are commercially available and commonly used to allow the nebulizer to be inserted within the ventilator circuit without disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, thus avoiding interruption of mechanical ventilation for nebulizer insertion and removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71363\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71363 \">picture 9</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-ventilator-circuit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The ventilator circuit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mesh nebulizer can be used effectively during mechanical ventilation and is placed between the ventilator outlet and the heated humidifier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/94,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,110</a>]. Unlike the jet nebulizer, the mesh nebulizer remains in the ventilator circuit and does not interfere with ventilator function (eg, no additional gas flow, no effect on triggering). (See <a href=\"#H339423\" class=\"local\">'Mesh nebulizers'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the jet nebulizer is less efficient than the pMDI during mechanical ventilation, the nebulizer can deliver a greater cumulative dose to the lower respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Thus, nebulizers and pMDIs produce similar therapeutic effects in mechanically ventilated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The use of a pMDI for routine bronchodilator therapy in ventilator-supported patients has been preferred because of the problems associated with the use of nebulizers, including contamination and triggering difficulty, as well as increased pressure and volume delivery. However, use of a mesh nebulizer avoids several of the problems of the jet nebulizer and performs comparably to pMDIs. Compared with the pMDI, the mesh nebulizer is a convenient and efficient delivery method in mechanically ventilated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. </p><p>Aerosol delivery by pMDI is easy to administer, involves less personnel time than a nebulizer, provides a reliable dose of the drug, and is free from the risk of bacterial contamination. When a pMDI is used with an in-line spacer, the ventilator circuit does not need to be disconnected with each treatment; this may reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. This also prevents the loss of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

For patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma not requiring mechanical ventilation, we suggest delivery of inhaled beta-2 agonists by nebulizer rather than pMDI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Use of a nebulizer for a severe asthma exacerbation may be intermittent (every 20 to 30 minutes) or continuous. The doses of beta-2 agonists for these applications are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72467 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H340028\" class=\"local\">'Acute asthma exacerbation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10617078\" class=\"local\">'Continuous nebulization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some drug preparations are only approved for delivery with specific nebulizers due to factors such as preventing contamination of the ambient environment, achieving greater precision in dosing, or preventing medication degradation by the aerosol technology. Examples of medications requiring specific nebulizers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloprost</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, DNase I, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treprostinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">treprostinil</a>. (See <a href=\"#H24790161\" class=\"local\">'Nebulizers for specific medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of medication aerosols by pMDI or nebulizer to a spontaneously breathing patient with a tracheostomy tube requires use of adaptive devices; examples are provided in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70613 \">picture 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Patients with tracheostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For mechanically-ventilated patients who require aerosol medication, we suggest the use of pMDIs, combined with a specialized spacer that is placed in the ventilator tubing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53295\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53295 \">picture 6</a>), or a mesh nebulizer, rather than a jet nebulizer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The pMDI method is technically easier than jet nebulizer treatments, involves less personnel time, provides a reliable dose of the drug, and reduces the risk of bacterial contamination that can occur with a nebulizer. Many of the advantages of the pMDI can be achieved with the mesh nebulizer. Inhaled medications can also be delivered effectively to patients receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV).
