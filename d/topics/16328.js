It may be idiopathic or associated with underlying pulmonary disease. The prognosis is usually good, although recurrence is frequent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothorax is defined as a collection of air that is located within the thoracic cage between the visceral and parietal pleura (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72656\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72656 \">image 1</a>). Air can enter the pleural space through a leak in either pleural surface. It may flow freely within the chest or be loculated by fibrous bands or other tissues. Rarely, air accumulates due to infection with gas-producing bacteria.</p><p>A pneumothorax is characterized as either spontaneous or traumatic. Traumatic pneumothorax is caused by blunt, crush, or penetrating trauma to the chest, by injury from a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, or as a consequence of mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-stabilization-of-children-with-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and stabilization of children with thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spontaneous pneumothorax, the subject of this topic review, occurs in the absence of any identified trauma. It is subdivided into primary and secondary types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is diagnosed when a thorough investigation reveals no underlying lung disease that would predispose the individual to air leak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) occurs as a complication of underlying lung disease, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), necrotizing pneumonia, and interstitial lung disease.</p><p/><p>The distinction between these types of pneumothorax is not always clear; many individuals with PSP have subtle indications of previously undiagnosed pulmonary disease, such as obstructive airway disease. In addition, apical blebs of unclear etiology have been detected by computed tomography (CT) or at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual incidence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) in the general population is estimated to be 5 to 10 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Among children and adolescents living in the United States, the incidence of PSP has been estimated to be 4 per 100,000 in males, and 1.1 per 100,000 in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The peak incidence occurs between 16 and 24 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rate of pneumothorax is relatively high in the newborn period. The reported incidence of pneumothorax in newborns and infants depends upon the setting and method of ascertainment. Small asymptomatic pneumothoraces probably occur in 1 to 2 percent of live births, whereas symptomatic pneumothoraces occur in about 2 in 10,000 live births (0.02 percent). Rates of PSP are increased among infants that are premature or large; infants with underlying lung disease including meconium aspiration are also at risk for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a strong male predominance for PSP in adults. Spontaneous pneumothorax is approximately three to six times more common in males than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12-14</a>], although women of reproductive age occasionally develop spontaneous pneumothorax triggered by menstruation (catamenial pneumothorax) (see <a href=\"#H18497240\" class=\"local\">'Catamenial pneumothorax'</a> below). There is also a male predominance among adolescents but probably not in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4789334\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSP typically affects patients with a tall, thin body habitus. In adults, smoking increases the risk of pneumothorax 22 times in men and 9 times in women, perhaps accounting for the higher incidence of the disorder in adults than children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pneumothorax has been reported with marijuana smoking and cocaine inhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>The majority of pneumothoraces occur at rest. However, in some cases, there is a history of an activity or event unrelated to thoracic trauma but associated with an acute increase in transpulmonary pressure; reported precipitating events include military flying, weight lifting, and Valsalva maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Rarely, contact sports such as football or ice hockey can cause pneumothorax through this mechanism (barotrauma) or through blunt chest trauma with pulmonary laceration, but these would be considered a traumatic pneumothorax. </p><p>Familial cases of spontaneous pneumothorax have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The majority of patients are adolescent or adult males, although newborns may be affected. Autosomal dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance has been proposed. In some cases, the familial predisposition is associated with pulmonary cysts, as in Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Individuals with connective tissue disease (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome and arterial tortuosity syndrome) might be at higher risk of developing spontaneous pneumothorax. In other cases, the exact predisposing factor cannot be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p>Underlying pulmonary conditions associated with spontaneous pneumothorax (ie, SSP) are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The overall incidence of SSP is similar to PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the incidence of PSP peaks in adolescence and young adulthood, whereas the peak incidence of SSP occurs at an older age, largely due to the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;</a>). In preadolescent children, rates of PSP and SSP are approximately equal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air leak through either the visceral pleura or the parietal pleura can cause pneumothorax, but spontaneous pneumothorax occurs exclusively via rupture of the visceral pleura. </p><p>Two mechanisms appear to explain most cases of alveolar rupture and spontaneous pneumothorax, and sometimes there is evidence for both mechanisms (eg, coughing in a patient with lung disease):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute increase in transpulmonary pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in the visceral pleura </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18497226\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute increase in transpulmonary pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is thought to be caused by large increases in transpulmonary pressure which cause alveolar distension. With sufficiently high pressure gradients, an alveolus can rupture. Rapid, large shifts in pressure can occur during spontaneous respiratory efforts, positive pressure ventilation, Valsalva maneuvers, or when a ball-valve mechanism is created due to airway obstruction.</p><p>Superficial alveoli can form subpleural blebs that rupture directly into the pleural space. These blebs are usually found in the lung apices, presumably due to the selective ventilation and higher transpulmonary pressures seen in the upper lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Alveoli located more centrally rupture and then the free air dissects along the perivascular tissue planes, moving centrifugally toward the hilum or peripherally toward the visceral pleural surface. Pneumomediastinum may occur if the alveolar rupture is into the mediastinum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75787\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75787 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-pneumomediastinum-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Air confined to the interstitial spaces results in pulmonary interstitial emphysema. If pressures are sufficiently high, gas can rupture centrally or peripherally from the interstitial space into the pleural space to produce a pneumothorax. Similarly, gas under significant tension can track along tissue planes into the pericardium, abdomen, or subcutaneous tissue, resulting in a pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum, or subcutaneous emphysema, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67176 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18497233\"><span class=\"h2\">Defects in visceral pleura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases a pneumothorax develops from direct injury to the visceral pleura due to underlying lung disease; these are considered secondary pneumothoraces. This mechanism may explain pneumothorax associated with infectious processes (such as tuberculosis, necrotizing pneumonia or abscess, Pneumocystis jirovecii [carinii] pneumonia, or infection in cystic fibrosis [CF]), connective tissue disease (such as Marfan syndrome or juvenile idiopathic arthritis), metastatic or embolic malignancies, congenital cystic anomalies, and catamenial pneumothorax (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Air leak associated with infection is probably due to localized inflammation and tissue necrosis that lead to the creation of a connection between the airways and pleural space (bronchopleural fistula), thereby allowing the free passage of gas into the pleural space. With tumors near the pleural surface, infarction and necrosis can lead to air leak by a similar mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18497240\"><span class=\"h2\">Catamenial pneumothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catamenial pneumothorax refers to recurrent pneumothoraces that are triggered by menstrual cycles; it is particularly unusual in adolescents but has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In many cases, it is associated with thoracic endometriosis, which occurs when endometrial tissue migrates from the peritoneal cavity into the thoracic cavity through congenital diaphragmatic defects or possibly through microembolization through the pelvic veins. The mechanism for the apparent association with thoracic endometriosis is unclear; it is possible that air leaks through defects left by sloughing of endometrial implants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnostic-approach-and-treatment-of-adults-with-thoracic-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnostic approach, and treatment of adults with thoracic endometriosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When pneumothorax occurs, the free passage of air into the pleural space allows equalization of intrapleural and atmospheric pressures, which predisposes to partial lung collapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54660\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54660 \">figure 2</a>). A small pneumothorax may be well-tolerated and asymptomatic. A large pneumothorax generally causes restrictive changes in lung mechanics with tachypnea and sometimes inspiratory retractions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4789320\"><span class=\"h2\">Tension pneumothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tension pneumothorax is caused when air enters the pleural space during inspiration but cannot be exited through the same pathway, similar to a one-way valve. This results in air accumulation within the pleural space, generating an intrapleural pressure that is substantially higher than the atmospheric pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The inward elastic recoil of the pulmonary parenchyma causes the involved lung to collapse, while increased intrathoracic pressure causes the mediastinum to shift away from the side of the pneumothorax (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77092 \">figure 3</a>). Tension pneumothorax is often associated with hypoxemia due to lung collapse, an increased work of breathing due to restrictive lung disease, and in some cases, hemodynamic changes with reduced venous return to the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of pneumothorax depends upon the volume of air in the pleural space, rapidity of onset, extent of lung collapse, tension within the pleural space, and the patient's age and respiratory reserve. The latter is influenced by the presence of any underlying pulmonary disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous pneumothorax most often occurs when patients are at rest or with minimal exertion. Patients with a large pneumothorax usually complain of the sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain that is described as sharp or stabbing and may be preceded by a popping sensation. The pain typically is diffuse on the affected side with radiation to the ipsilateral shoulder. A dry or non-productive cough is occasionally seen in association with pneumothoraces. The pain often resolves spontaneously during the first 24 hours, even if the pneumothorax persists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The history should investigate potential causes of secondary pneumothorax, such as use of inhaled drugs, undiagnosed asthma, foreign body aspiration, upper or lower respiratory tract infection, and connective tissue diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65455 \">table 1</a>). The presence of apical blebs supports the diagnosis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Otherwise, PSP is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. </p><p>A small pneumothorax may be asymptomatic. It may be detected as an incidental finding on a chest radiograph obtained for another indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic physical findings associated with a large pneumothorax include decreased chest excursion, diminished breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion, and decreased vocal fremitus on the affected side. Other signs of respiratory compromise may include tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and cyanosis.</p><p>Signs suggestive of tension pneumothorax include deviation of the trachea towards the contralateral side. Other signs of tension PSP include tachycardia, hypotension, and cyanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77092 \">figure 3</a>). Heart sounds may be diminished and the apical impulse shifted to the contralateral side. Tension pneumothorax is a respiratory emergency and requires urgent decompression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes#H254983688\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;, section on 'Tension pneumothorax'</a>.) </p><p>Subcutaneous emphysema with crepitation, or abdominal distension due to pneumoperitoneum, is occasionally present as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of pneumothorax is established by chest radiograph. When possible, the radiograph should be taken in the upright position. A pneumothorax tends to appear larger on an expiratory film and may enhance detection of small pneumothoraces. However, to monitor changes in the size of the pneumothorax over time, only inspiratory films should be compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16059641\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of size'</a> below.) </p><p>Anteroposterior and lateral views can confirm the presence of even small volumes of intrapleural air (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51728\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51728 \">image 3</a>). Characteristic findings are air in the pleural space outlining the visceral pleura (pleural line) and hyperlucency and an attenuation of vascular and lung markings on the affected side. Flattening or inversion of the diaphragm may occur on the affected side, and the mediastinum and trachea may shift away from the pneumothorax. Atelectasis due to compression by the pleural gas may be present as well. There is a left-side preponderance in both pediatric and adult patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atelectasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atelectasis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In infants, anterior-posterior radiographs typically are obtained in the supine position. In this position, the pneumothorax is difficult to detect because the air accumulates anteriorly. However, if the pneumothorax is large, the affected side may appear hyperlucent. Detection of smaller pneumothoraces may be improved by obtaining a radiograph taken with the infant in a lateral decubitus position, with the affected side up.</p><p>The plain chest radiograph may be difficult to interpret in disorders such as congenital cystic lung disease (eg, congenital lobar emphysema) or congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In these cases, the lung cysts or loops of bowel filled with air may mimic air in the pleural space. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest or contrast studies (upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through) usually can distinguish these conditions. Chest CT is also helpful in the detection of small apical blebs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61782\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61782 \">image 4</a>) and in assessing chest tube placement when needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, CT scanning is not necessary unless abnormalities are noted on the plain chest radiograph that require further assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The clinical significance of apical blebs (&lt;2 cm) discovered on a CT scan is unclear. The frequency of such blebs reported in the literature varies widely, ranging from 28 to 45 percent in children with PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/25,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34,35</a>], and 0 to 15 percent in healthy children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>]. Several studies in children suggest that the presence of apical blebs on CT does not predict recurrence risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/11,35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,35,37</a>]. In our practice, we do not consider small apical blebs to be an indication for surgical intervention in a patient with a first occurrence of PSP. However, we observe patients with apical blebs closely, and tend to move more quickly to surgical intervention if the patient does not improve with conservative management. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Surgical intervention'</a> below.) </p><p>In a newborn or very young infant with suspected pneumothorax, transillumination of the chest with a high-intensity fiberoptic probe in a darkened room may help make the diagnosis and guide treatment. When the fiberoptic probe is placed against the chest wall, the presence of a pneumothorax lights up the affected hemithorax and the air can be immediately evacuated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16059641\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimation of size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several methods have been used to estimate the size of a pneumothorax in adults, based on measurements from the chest radiograph. A clinically practical measure in adults is to define a large pneumothorax as one with &ge;3 cm of air between the pleural line and apical chest wall, or &ge;2 cm between the entire lateral lung edge and the chest wall. These measurements correspond to about 20 to 30 percent pneumothorax, but the accuracy of these methods is limited by uneven distributions of air in some cases and by distortion from digital imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax#H26873522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;, section on 'Size of pneumothorax'</a>.) </p><p>Methods to measure size of pneumothorax have not been standardized in pediatric populations, but use of the adult parameters is probably reasonable in adolescent patients. For smaller children, the clinician generally categorizes the pneumothorax as &quot;small&quot; or &quot;large&quot; based on the relative size of the pneumothorax compared with the thoracic cavity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial blood gas measurements should be obtained in patients with respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may not be accurate if perfusion is poor, as may occur in patients with tension pneumothorax. Hypoxemia commonly occurs because collapsed and poorly ventilated portions of lung continue to receive significant perfusion. Hypercapnia is unusual in patients without underlying lung disease because adequate alveolar ventilation can be maintained in the contralateral lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Acute respiratory alkalosis may be present if pain, anxiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxemia are substantial.

These may demonstrate axis deviation, nonspecific ST-wave changes, and T-wave inversion, particularly with left-sided pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and the American College of Chest Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] have published guidelines on the management of adults with spontaneous pneumothorax, and other recommendations have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1,5,13,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,13,41</a>]. Because little direct information is available, management in children is largely based upon the adult experience.</p><p>In general, treatment depends upon the size of the pneumothorax, the extent of respiratory distress, and the presence or absence of underlying lung disease. The goals of treatment are to remove air from the pleural space and to prevent recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H16059641\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of size'</a> above.)</p><p>Treatment can be conservative, limited to observation and supplemental oxygen, or invasive.

These patients should be given supplemental oxygen to enhance absorption of the air in the extrapleural space. Longer periods of observation are suggested for younger children and those with underlying lung disease (secondary pneumothorax).

There is some evidence that such patients are less likely to experience a recurrence if managed conservatively, compared with those undergoing chest tube insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. An ambulatory setting may be appropriate, as long as serial chest radiographs are obtained and emergency care is available if needed. Management using observation alone is common for adult patients in countries outside of the United States, and is frequently successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p>Caution should be used when extrapolating from data and guidelines used for adult patients, and no pediatric-specific management guidelines have been developed. However, a multicenter observational study from Australia and New Zealand provides some information about current management approaches and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Among 155 episodes of PSP, conservative management (no aspiration, chest tube, or surgery) was used for 59 percent of small PSPs and 20 percent of large PSPs. Among children managed conservatively, 55 percent were admitted to the hospital for observation; this rate of hospital admission for observation is higher than in most series in adults. &#160;</p><p>Since no specific outcome predictors have been established for children with pneumothorax, a cautious approach is appropriate; we recommend an initial period of hospital observation in any child with a pneumothorax. If the PSP is small and is resolving during the first 12 hours, observation may be continued on an outpatient basis. Younger patients (eg, under 12 years of age) should be observed for longer. All patients with SSP should be hospitalized for observation and treatment of underlying lung disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Supplemental oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend supplemental oxygen therapy for all patients hospitalized with pneumothorax, to hasten reabsorption of intrapleural air. One hundred percent oxygen should be delivered using a nonrebreathing facemask and a minimum flow rate of 15 liters per minute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This recommendation is based on limited evidence from small studies in adult patients and animal models. Without supplemental oxygen, the rate at which the air in the pleural space is reabsorbed is approximately 1.25 percent of the volume of the hemithorax per 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This rate can be increased if supplemental oxygen is given because the increased alveolar oxygen tension creates a steep gradient between the partial pressures of nitrogen in the pleural gas collection and the capillaries. In a small clinical study, administration of 100 percent supplemental oxygen increased the rate of reabsorption fourfold; the beneficial effect of oxygen was most pronounced in patients with large pneumothoraces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A large pneumothorax is often defined as &ge;3 cm rim of air between the pleural line and apical chest wall in adults. We also use these guidelines in children. However, an individualized approach and careful monitoring of pathophysiologic consequences is important regardless of the management strategy because estimates of pneumothorax size and clinical outcomes are not well-defined for this age group.

Air is withdrawn manually until no more can be aspirated. Continuous aspiration of a substantial volume of air indicates that the air leak is persistent and lung expansion has not occurred. In this case, tube thoracostomy should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Thoracostomy tube'</a> below.)</p><p>If no further air can be aspirated, the stopcock is closed and the catheter is secured to the chest wall. A chest radiograph should be obtained after four hours of observation. If adequate expansion has occurred, the catheter can be removed and the patient observed for an additional two hours. Although an adult patient can be discharged if the lung remains expanded on the chest radiograph at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], we recommend that children who require aspiration of a pneumothorax continue to be observed in the hospital for at least 24 hours with close monitoring or telemetry. A repeat chest radiograph should be obtained prior to considering hospital discharge.</p><p>In patients treated with needle aspiration, the air will reaccumulate in 20 to 50 percent because of a persistent air leak, so close follow-up with serial chest radiographs is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>].

If the lung does not fully expand after drainage, suction should be applied to a water seal device. Early use of strong suction is not recommended because rapid expansion of the lung is associated with a risk of reexpansion-induced pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;, section on 'Reexpansion pulmonary edema'</a>.) </p><p>If no bubbles emanate from the thoracostomy tube for 12 hours or more, we recommend clamping the chest tube for an additional 24 hours to observe whether air reaccumulates, although the utility of this approach is unproven.

The optimal method for pleurodesis in children has not been established.

There is good evidence to suggest that surgery is warranted to treat persistent air leaks. It is not yet clear whether surgery is appropriate for a first occurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax and whether such intervention will ensure the prevention of recurrence. </p><p>Most case series suggest that 50 to 60 percent of children with a first occurrence of PSP will have a recurrence after conservative management with chest tube drainage; this recurrence risk is as high or higher than that reported in adults with PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/11,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,35</a>] (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below). Thus, some experts suggest that surgical intervention should be considered for first occurrences as well as recurrences, if expertise in minimally invasive techniques is readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

We usually use VATS, which provides adequate exposure for resection or stapling and an opportunity for abrasion or chemical pleurodesis. The morbidity of VATS is less than with conventional or mini-thoracotomy, and recurrence rates are about 5 percent in adults, although open thoracotomy and pleurectomy have the lowest recurrence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Pleurodesis (intrapleural instillation of a sclerosing agent) is often performed at the time of surgery to decrease the risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].

Pleurodesis using talc (poudrage) is sometimes used in adults, but we do not use this technique in children because its long-term risks have not been sufficiently studied in this age group. In addition, technical difficulties arise because the currently available medical trocars are large and cannot be used in small children.

With no underlying lung disease (primary pneumothorax), the procedure is usually reserved for a recurrence. Pleurodesis also is recommended for individuals who participate in activities associated with increased risk of pneumothorax, such as deep sea diving or flying in small, unpressurized aircraft.

We recommend that all patients hospitalized with PSP be given supplemental oxygen to enhance absorption of the air in the extrapleural space (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H792648\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and adolescents with SSP, we suggest surgical intervention for patients with recurrent SSP and for those with underlying lung disease that is severe or progressive, or is known to be associated with recurrent pneumothoraces (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with CF, surgical intervention is recommended for the first recurrence of a pneumothorax, but not for the first occurrence.
