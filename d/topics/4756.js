Patients with CF have abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across secretory epithelia, resulting in thickened, viscous secretions in the bronchi, biliary tract, pancreas, intestines and reproductive system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Although the disease is systemic, progressive lung disease continues to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality for most patients. Over a variable time course, ranging from months to decades after birth, individuals eventually develop chronic infection of the respiratory tract with a characteristic array of bacterial flora, leading to progressive respiratory insufficiency and eventual respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The rate of progression varies widely, depending in part on genotype (including gene modifiers) as well as environmental factors. Registry data from CF Centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe indicate a median survival of about 40 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61930\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61930 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Females with CF appear to have higher morbidity and mortality than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This &quot;gender gap&quot; is modest but consistent across many populations and is hypothesized to be due to the pro-inflammatory effects of estrogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of CF associated-lung disease is undertaken with a variety of modalities, including mechanical airway clearance, antimicrobials, bronchodilators, supplemental oxygen, mucolytics, and a variety of other novel treatments in clinical trials.

CFTR has been shown to function as a regulated chloride channel, which in turn may regulate the activity of other chloride and sodium channels at the cell surface. The net result of these changes is an alteration in the rheology of airway secretions, which become thick and difficult to clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1531054\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic airway obstruction caused by viscous secretions is soon followed by colonization with pathogenic bacteria, including <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> complex species. Methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> is encountered with increasing frequency in many regions. Other organisms frequently encountered in the CF airways include <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em>, <em>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</em> and <em>Klebsiella</em> spp, although the contribution of these pathogens to the development of bronchial disease is not always clear. Chronic bacterial infection within the airways occurs in most patients with CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55018 \">table 1</a>), and the prevalence of each bacterial type varies with the age of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74073\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74073 \">figure 2</a>). Even among asymptomatic infants identified by newborn screening, there is evidence of subclinical lung disease within the first few months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function'</a> below). Infection with <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> are common even in young children with CF. The presence of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> with a mucoid phenotype is particularly suggestive of CF. Nontuberculous mycobacteria and fungal species such as <em>Aspergillus</em> also contribute to clinical disease in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;, section on 'Pathogens'</a>.)</p><p>Once infection is established, neutrophils are unable to control the bacteria, even though there is massive infiltration of these inflammatory cells into the lung tissue. Recruited neutrophils subsequently release elastase, which overwhelms the antiproteases of the lung and contributes to tissue destruction. In addition, large amounts of DNA and cytosol matrix proteins are released by degranulating neutrophils, contributing to the increased viscosity of the airway mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]</p><p>A subset of patients colonized with <em>Aspergillus</em> develop a hypersensitivity reaction known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which causes acute or subacute deterioration of pulmonary function and should be treated. Patients who grow <em>Aspergillus</em> species from respiratory cultures but who do not have evidence of ABPA should be observed closely but do not warrant treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Airway reactivity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection#H3733026178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;, section on 'Aspergillus species'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1531082\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchiectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic inflammation causes lung damage that ultimately advances to the stage of irreversible bronchiectasis and progressive respiratory failure. Terminal findings often include severely congested parenchyma, with grossly purulent secretions in and around dilated airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59374\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59374 \">picture 1</a>). The airway epithelium is hyperplastic, often with areas of erosion and squamous metaplasia. Plugs of mucoid material and inflammatory cells are often present in the airway lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78974\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78974 \">picture 2</a>). Submucosal gland hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle may also be noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Prospective studies have identified evidence of bronchiectasis by computerized tomography (CT) in 50 to 75 percent of children with CF by three to five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. In a study of infants with CF identified by newborn screening, the point prevalence of bronchiectasis on a single CT was about 30 percent at 3 months and 12 months of age, 44 percent at two years, and 61 percent at three years. 32 percent had CT evidence of persistent bronchiectasis at three years of age. Important predictors of early bronchiectasis included a history of meconium ileus at birth (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.51-6.66), severe genotype (OR 2.54, CI 1.57-4.11), respiratory symptoms at the time of the study (OR 2.57, CI 1.50-4.39) and neutrophil elastase activity in fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (OR 4.21, 95% CI 1.45-12.21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) usually begin early in life, although in milder cases the onset of persistent lung disease may be delayed until the second or third decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Before the era of newborn screening, pulmonary disease was the primary presenting symptom for approximately 40 percent of children diagnosed with CF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory manifestations of CF usually start with a recurrent cough that gradually becomes persistent. In young infants, this may manifest as prolonged or recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis with tachypnea and wheezing. Eventually, coughing occurs on a daily basis, becoming productive and often paroxysmal. The productive nature of the cough may be overlooked in young children, who tend to swallow sputum.</p><p>Chronic infection and inflammation lead to progressive tissue damage in the airways. Lysosomal enzymes released from infiltrating neutrophils contribute to progressive destruction of the airway walls. The airways become floppy and collapsible under conditions of high flow, which leads to progressive air trapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As the disease progresses, an increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax becomes apparent on physical examination, with many older patients demonstrating a barrel-shaped chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other late complications include spontaneous pneumothorax and hemoptysis, which may be massive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'Noninfectious pulmonary complications'</a>.)</p><p>Young children with CF may be at higher risk than typical peers for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). One study employed polysomnography to evaluate sleep in 40 children with mild and stable CF-associated lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nearly 70 percent of the CF patients were found to have mild or moderate OSA (defined as an apnea-hypopnea index &gt;2), substantially more than in age-matched controls. OSA was more severe in CF patients younger than six years. The mechanisms for the association between CF and OSA have not been established, but chronic inflammation and nasopharyngeal obstruction may play a role. &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway hyperreactivity is a common finding in CF patients. In one study of young children with CF (mean age 16 months), 50 percent had wheezing, and 43 percent of children who wheezed were responsive to bronchodilator therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Many patients continue to demonstrate bronchial hyperresponsiveness into adolescence and adulthood, with positive correlations between the degree of airway reactivity and overall severity of lung disease. Although invasive fungal disease is rare in patients with CF, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is increasingly recognized in CF patients. Marked exacerbation of wheezing or otherwise unexplained deterioration in lung function despite antibiotic therapy in CF patients should prompt a careful evaluation for this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, patients with CF sometimes become less responsive to bronchodilators over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This phenomenon may occur when progressive airway damage leads to a loss of cartilaginous support, resulting in an increased reliance on muscle tone for maintenance of airway patency. In this setting, the muscle relaxation caused by bronchodilators can cause collapse of such &quot;floppy&quot; airways, leading to increased airflow obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain films</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mild lung disease, the chest radiograph may appear normal for many years, but in most patients at least mild radiographic findings are evident in the first decade of life. The first discernible change is usually hyperinflation, which may initially be reversible with treatment for acute exacerbations of infection. As the disease progresses, hyperinflation becomes persistent, and the bronchovascular markings become more prominent. For unclear reasons, abnormalities tend to appear in the upper lobes first, progressing to the lower lobes with advancing disease.</p><p>With time, the bronchovascular markings progress to a pattern of bronchiectasis and cyst formation. Peribronchial cuffing and &quot;tram tracks&quot; (parallel lines caused by thickened bronchial walls in longitudinal section) appear, followed by the rounded shadows of saccular bronchiectasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56034\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56034 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-bronchiectasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of bronchiectasis in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Increasing hyperinflation leads to progressive flattening of the diaphragms, a prominent retrosternal space, and kyphosis in late stages of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71098%7EPULM%2F55878\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71098 graphicRef55878 \">image 2A-B</a>). Thin-walled cysts (most common in the upper lobes) may appear to extend to the lung surface, and pneumothorax is observed with increasing frequency in older patients. In advanced stages of disease, the chest radiograph may demonstrate little or no correlation with acute clinical changes.</p><p>With good clinical care and careful attention to daily airway clearance, the classic radiographic signs of cystic fibrosis (CF) may be delayed for many years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest may be helpful in defining the extent of bronchiectasis in some patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53471\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53471 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This is of particular interest in patients who have focal areas of advanced disease, which may sometimes be amenable to surgical resection. CT surveillance may also be useful to monitor the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression of disease caused by atypical mycobacteria.</p><p>The degree of bronchiectasis noted on CT is associated with infection with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the degree of bronchiectasis is only weakly correlated with measures of pulmonary function, and not well correlated with exercise performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Serial high resolution CT scans often display progressively severe disease, despite apparently stable pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Thus, changes in pulmonary function may be more subtle than, or lag behind the CT abnormalities. CT scanning may demonstrate evidence of unsuspected air trapping and inhomogeneities of lung inflation even in very young asymptomatic children, and are thus a sensitive indicator of early disease in children too young to perform pulmonary function testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. More studies will be needed to determine the role of serial CT scanning in the evaluation and care of CF patients, balancing the risk of repeated exposure to radiation with the potential benefits of earlier identification of bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3320675625\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest has not been well-validated as an approach to tracking CF pulmonary disease. The few existing studies indicate that MRI may overestimate the degree of bronchiectasis in patients with relatively mild disease, and underestimate bronchiectasis in patients with more severe disease. Improving technology allows better imaging of the lung using MRI, producing better concordance between CT and MRI images of the lung. MRI generally provides improved functional imaging of the lung (for example, superior evaluation of regional perfusion), but is still somewhat inferior to CT for imaging structural detail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Preliminary data from a study that used both techniques suggest that bronchiectasis scores on both MRI and CT are correlated with pulmonary function, but MRI still tended to overestimate bronchiectasis compared with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this study, MRI bronchiectasis scores were also correlated with pulmonary exacerbations, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and patient-reported respiratory symptoms. As clinicians increasingly seek to identify structural changes in the lungs of CF patients, lifetime exposure to radiation is becoming a serious concern. MRI may become a useful, safer alternative to serial CT scanning, but is not yet appropriate for widespread use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Contrast bronchography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the advent of CT scanning, there is no clinical indication for contrast bronchography. When they were used in the past, they often provided evidence of saccular bronchiectasis in patients with advanced CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61165\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61165 \">image 4</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants with cystic fibrosis (CF), subtle changes in lung structure and function may be identifiable from a very early age, even before clinical signs of disease are apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) in infants are performed using a technique of forced expiration and are well validated. In infants with CF, the tests typically are normal at the time of diagnosis by newborn screening, but may deteriorate by six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The decline in infant pulmonary function is associated with signs of pulmonary inflammation and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Infant lung function tests have been shown to correlate with results of standard pulmonary function testing performed six years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Over time, the majority of CF patients develop an obstructive pattern on PFT. The most sensitive measures of early airway obstruction are increases in the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity <span class=\"nowrap\">(RV/TLC)</span> and decreases in the forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75 percent of lung volume (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>). As disease progresses, spirometry reveals a decline in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Helium may diffuse very slowly into congested areas of the lung, so the helium diffusion technique may underestimate these parameters. Plethysmography provides a more accurate measure of lung volumes in patients with CF, and a comparison of volumes obtained by the two techniques may provide a quantitative measure of underventilated lung volume. </p><p>A technique of multiple-breath inert gas washout has been employed to detect early lung disease in infants and young children with CF. This technique appears to have greater sensitivity to detect early airway obstruction as compared to spirometry, and may have future research applications in evaluating new therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>CF patients demonstrate greater within-patient variability in pulmonary function than do normal subjects, even with extensive practice in performance of the maneuvers. These variations reflect fluctuations in the degree of airway inflammation, so PFTs are reliable indicators of acute changes in respiratory function. As an example, the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC may drop 10 to 15 percent with acute exacerbations and return to &quot;baseline&quot; values after several weeks of treatment. These fluctuations are often used as indicators for the adequacy of treatment during acute flares of bronchitis.</p><p>Despite intensive therapy, pulmonary function gradually decreases as patients get older, although the pattern of change is unpredictable and varies greatly among individuals. The patterns that may be seen include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linear decreases in FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Near normal pulmonary function for many years, followed by a rapid decline</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stepwise decreases in measurements of pulmonary function, separated by years of stability at a new level of function</p><p/><p>The FEV<sub>1</sub> is correlated with survival in CF patients. In a large observational study, predictors of the rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> included poor nutritional status, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> infection, persistent crackles on examination, and frequency of pulmonary exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients with mild pulmonary function abnormalities (high FEV<sub>1</sub>) sometimes experience rapid declines, suggesting that even patients with apparently high lung function and young children should be followed regularly with spirometry. A rapid decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>, or an FEV<sub>1</sub> persistently lower than 30 percent of predicted may be useful indicators of the need for transplant evaluation in patients with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

This may initially occur only during sleep or exercise, but patients with advanced disease often require continuous oxygen supplementation. Hypercapnia occurs relatively late in the course of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-supplemental-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term supplemental oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic hypoxemia and hypercarbia may eventually lead to muscular hypertrophy of the pulmonary vasculature with pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and eventually cor pulmonale with right heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H1880531583\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p>Polycythemia typically occurs in patients with congenital heart disease as a physiologic compensation for chronic hypoxia. By contrast, polycythemia is a rare finding in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Several factors may prevent the polycythemic response in patients with CF, including the anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency. In addition, blood volume tends to increase as the disease progresses, so absolute increases in red cell mass may not be reflected in the hematocrit. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1880531583\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As for all patients with advanced chronic lung disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with significantly worse survival. In one study, patients with mild pulmonary hypertension had a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 1.9 (95% CI 1.29-2.85) compared with CF patients without pulmonary hypertension, and those with severe pulmonary hypertension had an HR for death of 4.17 (95% CI 1.71-10.16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

This predisposes them to chronic pulmonary infection with pathogenic bacteria, including <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> complex species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55018 \">table 1</a>); the prevalence of each bacterial type varies with the age of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74073\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74073 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1531054\" class=\"local\">'Pathogens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic inflammation causes lung damage that ultimately advances to the stage of irreversible bronchiectasis and progressive respiratory failure. Terminal findings often include severely congested parenchyma, with grossly purulent secretions in and around dilated airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59374\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59374 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1531082\" class=\"local\">'Bronchiectasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory manifestations of CF usually start with a recurrent cough that gradually becomes persistent. In young infants, this may manifest as prolonged or recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis with tachypnea and wheezing. Eventually, coughing occurs on a daily basis, becoming productive and often paroxysmal. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway hyperreactivity is a common finding in CF patients, manifested by wheezing which is initially responsive to bronchodilator therapy. However, as the disease progresses the airway tends to become floppier and patients may become unresponsive to bronchodilator administration. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Airway reactivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chest radiograph may appear normal for the first few years of life, or longer in patients with mild disease. The first discernible change is usually hyperinflation. Later, bronchovascular markings become more prominent. In advanced disease, the chest radiograph reveals peribronchial cuffing and &quot;tram tracks,&quot; followed by the rounded shadows of saccular bronchiectasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56034\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56034 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Plain films'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a sensitive measure of CF lung disease. Serial HRCT scans may detect progressive disease before changes are noted in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) or clinical symptoms. The clinical utility of HRCT in making management decisions has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CF is characterized by the following findings on PFTs (in the order in which the abnormalities develop as the disease progresses) (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increases in the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity <span class=\"nowrap\">(RV/TLC)</span> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreases in the forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75 percent of lung volume (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decline in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increases in total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV), which are most accurately measured by plethysmography</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of PFTs vary with acute changes in respiratory function. In addition, patients exhibit an overall declining trend in pulmonary function as their disease progresses, but the decline may not be linear. Decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> is associated with diminished survival. A rapid decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> or an FEV<sub>1</sub> persistently lower than 30 percent of predicted are useful indicators of the need for transplant evaluation.
