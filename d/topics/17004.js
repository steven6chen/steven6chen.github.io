Among the tests doctors use, 2 are especially important in keeping track of whether HIV treatment is working. These are called the &quot;viral load test&quot; and the &quot;CD4 cell count.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105340681\"><span class=\"h1\">What is viral load?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral load is the amount of virus in your blood. If you have HIV, it's important to have your viral load tested often. This test helps your doctors check on your infection. It can also show whether your treatment is working.</p><p>The goal of treatment is to get your viral load below &quot;detectable levels.&quot; That means there is so little virus in your blood that the test cannot even pick it up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105340688\"><span class=\"h1\">What are CD4 cell counts?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV attacks and destroys the cells in your body that fight infection. This virus especially likes to kill a type of cell called &quot;CD4+ T&quot; cells &ndash; often called &quot;CD4 cells&quot; or &quot;T cells&quot; for short.</p><p>The number of CD4 cells you have has a lot to do with how well you fight infection. In general, people who have CD4 cell counts below 200 have a hard time fighting infections. They can get something called &quot;opportunistic&quot; infections. Opportunistic infections are caused by germs that healthy people can usually fight off. In people with HIV, though, these germs can cause infection.</p><p>If your CD4 count gets too low, your doctor will probably want to give you medicines to keep you from getting opportunistic infections. For example, if your CD4 count falls below 200, your doctor might give you antibiotics to prevent a lung infection called &quot;PCP pneumonia.&quot; When your CD4 counts get back up over 200, you can stop the antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105340695\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should I have viral load and CD4 tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>How often you should be tested will depend on how your treatment is going and how recently you were diagnosed with HIV.</p><p>Some people need to be tested every 2 to 8 weeks. This might include people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were recently diagnosed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recently started treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recently changed treatment</p><p/><p>It is very important that you follow your doctor's instructions about getting tested. The results of your viral load tests will tell your doctor whether your HIV treatment is helping. The results of your CD4 tests will tell your doctor how well your immune system is working.</p><p>People whose HIV seems to be under control and who are not changing medicines or doses might go 6 months to a year between testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105340702\"><span class=\"h1\">Can anything besides HIV affect viral load and CD4 test results?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your viral load is mostly affected by your HIV treatment. If your treatment is working right, your viral load should go down below the level that test can even detect.</p><p>CD4 counts can go down because of a lot of things, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections (other than HIV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105340746\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-treatment-for-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Starting treatment for HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-with-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults with HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-hiv-after-unprotected-sex-or-needle-sharing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing HIV after unprotected sex or needle-sharing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-or-body-fluid-exposure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood or body fluid exposure (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Initial treatment of HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-of-hiv-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Symptoms of HIV infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tips-for-taking-hiv-medications-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Tips for taking HIV medications (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: HIV and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
