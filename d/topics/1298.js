One in three children experience at least one acute wheezing illness before the age of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A nationwide survey performed in the United States between 1988 and 1994 showed that the prevalence for wheezing amongst two to three year olds was 26 percent and amongst 9 to 11 year olds was 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Subsequent reports continue to show similar prevalence. In a 2007 survey in the US and Europe, a total of 9490 children aged one to five years were screened for respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Overall, 3077 (32 percent) reported recurrent cough, wheeze, or breathlessness in the preceding six winter months. The prevalence of these symptoms varied from 29 percent in Northern Europe to 48 percent in Southern Europe. The overall prevalence in the US was 27 percent. A large worldwide study looking at older children showed a global prevalence of wheezing of 11.6 percent in children aged 6 to 7 years and 13.7 percent in children between 13 to 14 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Wheezing may be either a benign, self-limited process or the presenting symptom of a significant respiratory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The role of the treating clinician is to try to reach the most likely diagnosis as quickly and efficiently as possible so that therapy, if necessary, can be instituted and the parental concerns can be addressed.</p><p>A diagnostic approach to wheezing in childhood is presented in this topic review.

It is produced by the oscillation of opposing walls of an airway narrowed almost to the point of closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It can be high pitched or low pitched, consist of single or multiple notes, and occur during inspiration or expiration. Some experts distinguish between wheezes and rhonchi based upon the dominant frequency, or pitch, of the sound. Wheezes have a dominant frequency greater than 400 Hz, whereas rhonchi are of lower frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, the clinical significance of this distinction, if any, is not well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Wheezes can originate from airways of any size throughout the proximal conducting airways. Wheezing requires sufficient airflow to generate airway oscillation and produce sound in addition to narrowing or compression of the airway. Thus, the absence of wheezing in a patient who presents with acute asthma may be an ominous finding, suggesting impending respiratory failure.</p><p>Wheezing caused by a fixed large or central airway obstruction or tracheomalacia tends to be low in pitch and has a constant acoustic character throughout the lung (homophonous wheezing) but varies in loudness depending upon the distance from the site of obstruction. In contrast, the degree of narrowing varies from place to place within the lung in the setting of small airway obstruction. As a result, the sounds generated also vary in quality and acoustic character and are described as heterophonous wheezes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Stridor refers to a monophonic sound that is loudest over the anterior neck. Stridor can be heard during inspiration, expiration, or throughout the respiratory cycle, depending on the location and severity of obstruction. In general, inspiratory stridor is prominent in the setting of extrathoracic obstruction, whereas expiratory stridor suggests intrathoracic obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-stridor-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of stridor in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3276968902\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most likely diagnosis in children with recurrent wheezing is asthma, regardless of the age of onset, evidence of atopic disease, precipitating causes, or frequency of wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, other diseases can present with wheezing in infancy and childhood, and patients with asthma may not wheeze. The differential diagnosis of wheezing includes a variety of congenital and acquired conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Wheezing can be divided clinically according to the acuity of its onset and the mechanism of airway narrowing. In addition to asthma, new-onset acute wheezing suggests infection or sudden airway obstruction, whereas chronic or recurrent wheezing may be caused by congenital abnormalities, cardiac disease, aspiration syndromes, impaired immunologic defenses, or underlying pulmonary disease. The age of onset of wheezing can also help determine the etiology. Certain diseases most commonly present in infancy, while other are seen more often in older children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2801179355\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute wheezing (hours to days)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to asthma, acute onset of wheezing in a child is most often caused by an infectious process or foreign body aspiration (FBA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H331410100\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of acute wheezing in infants &lt;2 years of age is viral bronchiolitis, usually due to infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Rhinovirus and paramyxoviruses, including parainfluenza virus and metapneumovirus, can also result in wheezing. A typical history is a prodrome of rhinorrhea, cough, and intermittent fever followed by wheezing and tachypnea. Physical examination usually reveals nasal congestion, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and polyphonic wheezes throughout the lungs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-metapneumovirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human metapneumovirus infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parainfluenza-viruses-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parainfluenza viruses in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Other, less common infections can be associated with acute wheezing. They include bacterial tracheitis, acute laryngotracheobronchitis, epiglottitis, acute bronchitis, <em>Mycoplasma</em> pneumonia, and peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, or lung abscesses.

In addition, FBA should be suspected in any child with a unilateral wheeze or unequal breath sounds. In children, unlike adults, the foreign body can lodge in any bronchus, without predilection for the right side. Patients can also present with chronic symptoms if FBA is not recognized in the acute setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1529226832\" class=\"local\">'Structural causes'</a> below.)</p><p>Esophageal foreign body also can present with acute wheezing secondary to compression of the airways. A history of feeding and swallowing difficulties and the presence of dysphagia are important clues to the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foreign-bodies-of-the-esophagus-and-gastrointestinal-tract-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Foreign bodies of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2853061696\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic or recurrent wheezing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of wheezing that is chronic or episodic is broad and includes structural abnormalities of the tracheobronchial tree or other thoracic structures. Nonstructural causes of chronic wheezing include asthma, aspiration syndromes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, vocal cord dysfunction, and other disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529226832\"><span class=\"h3\">Structural causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural abnormalities, including anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree and vascular rings or slings, are among the most common etiologies for persistent wheezing that presents early in life (typically in the first few months) and are not responsive to asthma therapies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree &ndash; </strong>Congenital tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia can present with noisy breathing early in life. Parents commonly describe the child as &quot;being born with a cold&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Wheezing can present at birth but more commonly becomes apparent in the first two to three months after birth. The wheezing usually is monophonic and becomes more pronounced with activity or in the setting of upper respiratory tract infections. Other symptoms can include a croup-like cough or stridor, depending upon the location of the lesion. The severity can range from a thriving child with noisy breathing to a child with severe respiratory distress.

These include complete (eg, double and right aortic arches) and incomplete (eg, pulmonary artery sling) rings and pulmonary artery slings. Hyperinflation or atelectasis of the right lung may be noted in patients with a pulmonary artery sling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-rings-and-slings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular rings and slings&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Signs and symptoms of vascular compression of the airways commonly appear early in life. Biphasic stridor is the most common sign in these patients, but wheezing, respiratory distress, recurrent respiratory infections, and apnea also may be presenting findings. Patients may also have symptoms related to esophageal compression by vascular structures, including feeding difficulty and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fistulas between the tracheobronchial tree and other anatomical structures can cause wheezing. Tracheoesophageal fistulae, including laryngotracheobronchial clefts, are the most common of these conditions. Some infants with rare H-type fistulas are not diagnosed in the immediate postnatal period. These infants can present with chronic cough and recurrent pneumonia as well as wheezing. Symptoms such as coughing and choking are increased with feeding.

Cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is an important associated finding. The anatomic location of the mass within the mediastinum provides some clues to the underlying diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56637\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56637 \">figure 1</a>). Masses below the trachea, for example, are associated with poor mucus clearance, reduced ventilation, and recurrent pneumonia.

In addition to compression of the mainstem bronchi by markedly enlarged central pulmonary arteries, compression of intrapulmonary bronchi by abnormally branching pulmonary arteries has been reported in patients with absent pulmonic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19,20</a>].

This can occur due to poor left ventricular function and, less commonly, due to pulmonary venous outflow obstruction. These conditions can result in distension of the pulmonary vascular bed, bronchiolar wall edema, increased airway resistance, and wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta may also play a part in airway remodeling. In addition, airway hyperactivity has been reported in patients with congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Cardiac findings including cardiomegaly and murmurs may be absent in some infants with obstructed venous return; therefore, a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As an example, wheezing was reported as the only presenting symptom in cases of isolated cor triatriatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

In many cases, these patients are misdiagnosed with difficult-to-control asthma. Aspiration syndromes are associated with a variety of anatomic and functional disorders. FBA and fistulas are reviewed above (see <a href=\"#H42496857\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body aspiration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1529226832\" class=\"local\">'Structural causes'</a> above). The two most common categories of functional disorders are gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and swallowing disorders:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GER seldom involves aspiration of large amounts of gastric contents. However, chronic microaspiration can cause significant mucosal edema and inflammation and may result in chronic cough and wheezing. Infants who take a bottle to bed are at increased risk of both wheezing and asthma during the first five years of life, probably because of recurrent microaspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Children with GER do not always report symptoms of reflux, such as heartburn or vomiting, but may present with more subtle findings, including nocturnal symptoms, hoarseness, or recurrent croup.

Anatomic abnormalities, such as laryngeal clefts and vocal cord paralysis, can also cause swallowing dysfunction leading to aspiration, which may be &quot;silent&quot; (ie, not associated with coughing or choking events). These infants may present with difficulty sucking or swallowing, drooling, fatigue, loss of interest, tachypnea, or apnea during feeding. The classic finding of coughing with feeding may be absent because of depression of the cough reflex caused by repeated stimulation of the receptors in the larynx and trachea.

In the normal larynx, the true vocal cords abduct on inspiration and expiration and adduct during phonation, swallowing, coughing, or Valsalva maneuver. In contrast, paradoxical vocal cord motion (PVCM) or vocal cord dysfunction is an inappropriate adduction of the true vocal cords on inspiration with abduction on expiration. The functional airway obstruction that arises from vocal cord adduction during inspiration results in significant respiratory distress and marked inspiratory stridor.

Persistent wheezing presenting very early in life suggests a congenital or structural abnormality. In contrast, paroxysmal or intermittent wheezing is a characteristic finding in patients with asthma. Persistent wheezing with sudden onset is consistent with FBA, whereas the slowly progressive onset of wheezing may be a sign of extraluminal bronchial compression by a growing mass or lymph node.

Typically, these infants present with classic coryzal symptoms that progress to coughing, wheezing, and, occasionally, respiratory distress over a period of three to five days. Resolution is gradual over approximately two weeks. These episodes are variably responsive to bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids but not antibiotics, expectorants, or antihistamines. A symptom-free period typically ensues, followed by recurrent wheezing with subsequent viral illnesses in up to 50 percent of these infants. While most of these young children will not have virus-induced wheezing after three years of age, some will go on to develop asthma.

In contrast, pure bronchoconstriction or structural causes for airway narrowing (eg, airway malacia or compression, foreign body, vascular ring) are usually associated with a dry cough. However, the underlying etiology of a dry cough can be complicated by a secondary process, making this distinction difficult (eg, mechanical obstruction can lead to impaired mucus clearance resulting in infection and a wet cough).

In contrast, the degree of narrowing varies from place to place within the lung in the setting of small airway obstruction (eg, asthma, CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia, aspiration).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1495860\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with diffuse wheezing, a trial of inhaled bronchodilators can be used to confirm the presence of reversible airway disease. However, a partial or negative response may not rule out asthma. Inflammation and airway swelling may contribute to wheezing, in addition to bronchoconstriction, especially in infants and young children. Thus, if asthma is still suspected in a patient with chronic or persistent symptoms, the combination of inhaled glucocorticoids and bronchodilators for at least two weeks (or five to seven days of oral glucocorticoids if the patient has more severe symptoms) may result in significant improvement in symptoms and help in making the diagnosis of asthma. Further work-up is indicated if the response to this therapy is inadequate or if a comorbid condition is still suspected in a patient who had a positive response to bronchodilator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few laboratory investigations that are useful in the initial evaluation of the wheezy child. In most cases, the probable diagnosis is suspected on the basis of the clinical history and physical examination. The role of laboratory tests, when indicated, is either to confirm the diagnosis or to rule out other less likely diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Complete blood counts are important in patients with chronic or systemic symptoms and may reveal anemia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia. Eosinophilia in this setting supports an underlying allergic process or possible parasitic infection. Further studies should be obtained based upon the suspected diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62889 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing for infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infection is an important cause of wheezing in children and is mediated through numerous mechanisms. Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family (eg, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus) and picornavirus family (eg, human rhinovirus) are important precipitants of wheezing in young children. Metapneumovirus, another member of the Paramyxoviridae family, is a newly recognized human pathogen that can result in upper and lower respiratory tract infection and may present with wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Thus, viral studies can be helpful in confirming the etiology of wheezing in infants and young children presenting with symptoms suggestive of bronchiolitis. However, they are not routinely recommended. Testing is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Virology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-metapneumovirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human metapneumovirus infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parainfluenza-viruses-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parainfluenza viruses in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Sputum stain and cultures may be useful in a setting suggestive of bacterial infections, including atypical infections (eg, mycobacterial or fungal infections), that can result in wheezing. Tuberculin skin testing and specific serologic assays can be helpful if these infections are suspected. Serologic testing for <em>Mycoplasma</em> may be performed if such an infection is suspected since <em>Mycoplasma</em> is an increasingly recognized cause of wheezing and may predispose children to the subsequent development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

It is expected that the majority of patients with CF will be diagnosed at birth due to newborn screening for CF. However, false negatives can occur. Thus, obtaining a sweat test is appropriate if clinical suspicion of the disease remains. Intermediate sweat testing results should be clarified by DNA analysis, and sweat chloride testing should be repeated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of diarrhea, failure to thrive, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clubbing should raise the suspicion for CF and warrants further evaluation. One should also have a low threshold to obtain this test in a patient with persistent or recurrent pulmonary symptoms that are unresponsive to asthma therapies, especially when wheezing is associated with a chronic productive cough, since identifying a patient with CF has major implications for the patient, the family, and future reproductive decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The sweat chloride test should be undertaken at a facility with substantial experience, and clinicians interpreting the results should be aware of other conditions that result in elevated sweat chloride concentrations.

Rigid bronchoscopy is used in patients with sudden onset of wheezing and suspected FBA. Flexible bronchoscopy can identify structural airway abnormality, including airway malacia (during spontaneous breathing when performed under conscious sedation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Nasopharyngoscopy, which allows visualization of the vocal cords and larynx without lower airway endoscopy, is mainly helpful in cases suspected to have vocal cord abnormality or dysfunction. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is useful in cases where infection or aspiration is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Presenting symptoms may include excessive burping or emesis, coughing after meals, and nocturnal cough or wheeze along with discomfort indicated by crying <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arching of the back. A positive response to empiric therapy (acid suppression) may be used to support a presumed diagnosis of GER [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitoring is a technique that permits measurement of all reflux episodes, including those that are weakly acidic or alkaline. It is usually used in combination with pH monitoring. In a trial comparing the two techniques, combined MII-pH monitoring detected reflux events that caused symptoms twice as often as pH monitoring alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing is a common presenting symptom of respiratory disease in children. It may be either a benign, self-limited process or the presenting symptom of a significant respiratory disease. The most likely diagnosis in children with recurrent wheezing is asthma. However, other diseases can present with wheezing in childhood, and patients with asthma may not wheeze (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67370 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wheeze is a continuous musical sound heard during chest auscultation that lasts longer than 250 msec. It is produced by the oscillation of opposing walls of an airway narrowed almost to the point of closure. It can be high pitched or low pitched, consist of single or multiple notes, occur during inspiration or expiration, and originate from airways of any size. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and physiology of wheezing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to asthma, acute onset of wheezing in a child is most often caused by infection or foreign body aspiration (FBA). (See <a href=\"#H331410100\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H42496857\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excluding asthma, the differential diagnosis of chronic or episodic wheezing is broad and includes structural abnormalities of the tracheobronchial tree or other thoracic structures (eg, vascular rings and slings, mediastinal masses). Nonstructural (functional) causes include aspiration syndromes (from gastroesophageal reflux [GER] and dysphagia), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, vocal cord dysfunction (including paradoxical vocal cord movement in older children), abnormal immunologic defense mechanisms, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). (See <a href=\"#H1529226832\" class=\"local\">'Structural causes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3036765224\" class=\"local\">'Functional causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient presents with a history of wheezing, it is crucial to ask the patient or the parents to describe what they actually are experiencing or hearing (or demonstrate it with a home video or audio recording taken on a mobile phone). On many occasions, the word &quot;wheezing&quot; is used as a general term to describe noisy breathing, including snoring, congestion, gurgling noises, or stridor. Two important aspects of the medical history include the patient's age at the onset of wheezing and the course of onset (acute versus gradual). Certain clinical features favor the diagnosis of asthma or suggest another diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70442\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70442 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General examination of a wheezy child should include measurement of weight and height; vital signs including oxygen saturation; digital inspection for the presence of cyanosis or clubbing; a complete chest examination; and cardiac, skin, and nasal examinations. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral chest radiographs are suggested in children with new-onset wheezing of undetermined etiology or chronic persistent wheezing not responding to therapies. Other radiologic studies may be helpful in selected cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62889 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are an important component of the diagnostic evaluation of a wheezy child. Infant PFT, if available, is helpful in assessing airway obstruction. In older children who are cooperative, PFT with inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops is helpful in determining the presence, degree, and location of airway obstruction, as well as the response to bronchodilators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients suspected of having asthma, a trial of inhaled bronchodilators with or without glucocorticoids can be used to confirm the diagnosis prior to initiating a more extensive work-up. Further work-up is indicated if the response to therapy is inadequate. (See <a href=\"#H1495860\" class=\"local\">'Response to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few laboratory investigations that are useful in the initial evaluation of the wheezy child. Any studies obtained beyond chest radiographs and PFTs should be based upon the suspected diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62889 \">table 5</a>). These studies include tests to examine for viral, bacterial, or fungal infections; sweat chloride test to diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF), evaluation for immunodeficiency, or allergy; endoscopy to examine for FBA, tracheomalacia, or ILD; and work-up for GER if indicated.
