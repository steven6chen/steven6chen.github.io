At the time of diagnosis, approximately 10 percent of patients with AL amyloidosis will meet diagnostic criteria for MM as defined by CRAB (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or bone disease) criteria; nearly another 40 percent of patients with AL do not meet criteria for MM but have 10 percent or more bone marrow plasmacytosis at diagnosis. The clinical course and treatment of these patients is dependent on which of the two diseases is dominant in terms of end-organ damage and symptoms. Less than 1 percent of patients with isolated AL amyloidosis at diagnosis develop MM at a future time point.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of AL amyloidosis will be reviewed in detail here.

Patients with less than two of these manifestations had a much higher overall (92 versus 11 percent) and event-free (46 versus 11 percent) survival than those with two or more manifestations.

Outside of a clinical trial, we suggest the use of high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> followed by autologous HCT, rather than chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116303\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116303 \">algorithm 1</a>). HCT should be performed at a center with specific expertise in AL amyloidosis.</p><p>Our preference for HCT is based on low quality data that suggest HCT can result in deeper responses and longer remissions. When successful, HCT stops amyloid production, amyloid deposits are slowly resorbed, and organ function, performance status, and quality of life improve. However, careful selection of patients is critical since there is an increased risk of TRM from compromised organ reserve due to amyloid deposition. (See <a href=\"#H15769190\" class=\"local\">'HCT efficacy and toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients can typically proceed directly to stem cell mobilization and transplantation without need for induction therapy. However, induction therapy with two to four cycles of a bortezomib-based regimen is administered prior to HCT if there is an anticipated delay to HCT beyond two months, or if there is concurrent multiple myeloma (MM), or if the bone marrow plasma cell percentage at diagnosis is &ge;10 percent. (See <a href=\"#H865232\" class=\"local\">'Bortezomib-based regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>Induction therapy is a standard component of MM treatment and offered to AL amyloidosis patients with concurrent MM or with &ge;10 percent bone marrow plasma cells based on the results of one study that suggested that these patients had an outcome similar to patients with coexistent MM and amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-immunoglobulin-light-chain-al-amyloidosis-and-light-and-heavy-chain-deposition-diseases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A caveat, however, is that drugs like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> are typically less well-tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis, so an induction regimen without one of these agents is typically preferred. Induction therapy can also slow amyloid production and limit further organ damage while awaiting HCT. Following HCT, we consider further therapy based on the degree of response achieved.
