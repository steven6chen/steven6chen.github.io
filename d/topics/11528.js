Cleavage of the prohormone proBNP produces biologically active 32 amino acid BNP as well as biologically inert 76 amino acid N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP).</p><p>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone that is released from myocardial cells in the atria and in some cases the ventricles in response to volume expansion and possibly increased wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. ANP circulates primarily as a 28 amino acid polypeptide, consisting of amino acids 99 to 126 from the C-terminal end of its prohormone, pro-ANP. </p><p>The release of both ANP and BNP is increased in heart failure (HF), as ventricular cells are recruited to secrete both ANP and BNP in response to the high ventricular filling pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The plasma concentrations of both hormones are increased in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, permitting their use in diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55557 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Natriuretic peptide levels are elevated in some patients with coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, and sepsis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F99857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99857 \">table 1</a>). The diagnostic and prognostic value of measuring plasma BNP and NT-proBNP in asymptomatic individuals and patients with such non-HF conditions is discussed here. While the discussion here will focus on patients without overt HF, BNP or NT-proBNP elevations in some of these settings may be a sign of undiagnosed HF. </p><p>The diagnostic and prognostic value of measuring plasma BNP, NT-proBNP, and mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with HF and the possible therapeutic role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nesiritide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nesiritide</a> (recombinant human BNP) in the management of patients with decompensated HF is discussed separately.

This was demonstrated in a prospective evaluation of 3346 participants (mean age 59 years) in the Framingham Heart Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At five years, 119 patients died (3.6 percent) and 79 had a first cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction [MI], coronary insufficiency, death from coronary heart disease, HF, or stroke; 2.4 percent). Baseline plasma BNP and N-proANP levels above the 80th percentile were both associated with a significant increase in the subsequent development of HF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.07 and 5.02), as well as less marked increases in all-cause mortality, atrial fibrillation, and stroke or transient ischemic attack.</p><p>The ability of NT-proBNP to predict cardiovascular events was evaluated in a population-based study of 626 older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Individuals with NT-proBNP levels above the 80th percentile (more than 655 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> had, at five-year follow-up, a significant increase in mortality compared with those with lower values (adjusted HR for mortality 1.96 overall and 1.82 after adjustment for left ventricular dysfunction compared with lower values and an absolute unadjusted increase in mortality of 24.5 percent). Among the 537 participants with no prior history of cardiovascular disease, those with NT-proBNP above the 80th percentile had a significantly higher risk of a first major cardiovascular event (adjusted hazard ratio 3.24).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27656794\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis in ACS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevations in plasma BNP or NT-proBNP are associated with increased mortality in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. The prognostic value of plasma BNP and NT-proBNP in this setting is discussed in detail separately.

The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a review of 1085 such patients who had plasma BNP measured at baseline and were then prospectively followed for a mean of 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was a stepwise decrease in event-free survival across quartiles of plasma BNP. After adjustment for confounders including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), patients in the highest quartile (plasma BNP &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> had a significant 6.1-fold increase in risk compared with those in the lowest quartile (plasma BNP &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL);</span> the HR was 4.4 for plasma BNP values &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>.</p><p>Plasma N-terminal pro-BNP appears to have equivalent predictive value in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The predictive value of NT-proBNP in patients with stable angina was evaluated in a report of 1034 patients who were referred for coronary angiography and then followed for nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At follow-up, 288 patients (28 percent) had died. The patients who died had significant higher NT-proBNP values at presentation (386 versus 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>. Patients with NT-proBNP values in the highest quartile were older, had a lower LVEF, and were more likely to have diabetes and a prior MI. In a multivariable model, these patients had an HR for death of 2.4 compared with those in the lowest quartile.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a review of 1059 patients with chronic stable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At a median of 3.6 years, the five-year mortality progressively increased from 4.7 percent in patients in the lowest quartile of NT-proBNP to 7.8 percent, 11.4 percent, and 32.7 percent in the second, third, and highest quintiles, respectively (adjusted HR 6.0, 95% CI 1.6-23 for the highest compared with lowest quintile). A similar prognostic value was noted for cardiovascular mortality and for patients with New York Heart Association functional class I and II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a>). However, as in the previous study, patients in the highest NT-proBNP quartile had other major comorbidities including highest rates of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and New York Heart Association class III or IV (18.5 versus 0.8 percent in the lowest quartile).</p><p>Further studies are required to determine if measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP has clinical utility in the management of patients with stable angina. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18422007\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre- and postoperative elevations in plasma BNP are associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events at 30 days. In a 2009 meta-analysis that included seven studies of 2841 patients who had a serum BNP measurement before noncardiac surgery, there was a statistically significant association between a preoperative elevation in serum BNP and the cardiovascular outcomes of death, cardiac death, and nonfatal MI at 30 days (adjusted odds ratio 19.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A 2011 meta-analysis that evaluated postoperative mortality at six months or later came to a similar conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The relationship between pre- and postoperative BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 18 studies (n = 2179) in which BNP was sampled preoperatively and within seven days after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An elevated pre-operative NP level (&gt;92 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> for BNP or &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span> for NT-proBNP) predicted the primary composite outcome of death or nonfatal MI at 30 days (odds ratio 3.4) and at &ge;180 days (odd ratio 2.6). The addition of postoperative NP to a risk prediction model containing preoperative NP improved risk classification at 30 and &ge;180 days. Elevated postoperative NP was the strongest independent predictor of the primary outcome at both time points. While it appears that BNP measured either before or shortly after surgery has prognostic information, the implications of this finding are uncertain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16051290\"><span class=\"h2\">Valvular heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential prognostic value of natriuretic peptide measurement in patients with valvular heart disease is discussed separately.

However, wall stretch is increased in the latter but minimized in the former by the thickened pericardium. This difference suggests that measurement of plasma BNP might have value in distinguishing between these two disorders.</p><p>This hypothesis was evaluated in a report of six patients with constrictive pericarditis and five with restrictive cardiomyopathy in which plasma BNP was markedly elevated in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy but just above normal in those with constrictive pericarditis (825 versus 128 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These intriguing observations need to be confirmed in a larger number of patients to determine the accuracy of BNP testing in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy#H740032\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Plasma BNP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27657061\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma BNP concentrations are elevated in patients with primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension. In such patients, they correlate positively with right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and right ventricular mass, and inversely with cardiac index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-non-heart-failure-settings/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Using elevated plasma BNP to determine the cause of dyspnea in patients with pulmonary hypertension may be misleading since lung disease is responsible for the dyspnea unless the patient has secondary pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease.
