Symptoms and signs remain indefinitely if the brain becomes irreversibly damaged and infarction occurs. Unfortunately, neurologic symptoms do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of infarction, and the tempo of the symptoms does not indicate the cause of the ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This is a critical issue because treatment depends upon accurately identifying the cause of symptoms, and the nature, location, and severity of causative cardiac, hematologic, and cerebrovascular abnormalities.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke will be reviewed here. The evaluation of stroke and transient cerebral ischemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. In keeping with this definition of TIA, ischemic stroke is defined as an infarction of central nervous system tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H2074998073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Definition of TIA'</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;transient ischemic attack&quot; was first introduced in the early 1950s based upon the recognition that a transient focal loss of neurologic function often preceded strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the years after this initial description in patients with carotid artery disease, various groups and committees arbitrarily defined TIAs as lasting less than 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, this classic definition of TIA was inadequate for several reasons. Most notably, there is risk of permanent tissue injury (ie, infarction) even when focal transient neurologic symptoms last less than one hour.</p><p>Subsequent data demonstrated that ischemic attacks that last longer than one hour are most often associated with brain infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Most TIAs last less than one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, the benign connotation of TIA has been replaced by an understanding that even relatively brief ischemia can cause permanent brain injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms of TIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient ischemic attacks are caused by decreased blood flow to a local portion of the brain. Decreased perfusion can be due to blockage of blood flow to a brain region from an in-situ occlusion of a supply artery, or from embolism to that artery. Symptoms are <strong>focal</strong>, suggesting that they relate to dysfunction of a localized area of the brain. Symptoms are also <strong>transient</strong> when the arterial blockage passes (eg, following dissolution or distal passage of an embolus) or when collateral circulation is able to restore adequate perfusion to the region of ischemia. The symptoms and signs may fluctuate depending upon the adequacy of perfusion, which is in turn related to systemic factors (eg, blood volume, cardiac output, blood pressure, blood viscosity) and local factors (eg, propagation and embolization of clot, development of collateral circulation).</p><p>The symptoms of TIAs depend upon the underlying vascular cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71676 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When ischemia is caused by penetrating artery disease, for example, the symptoms are usually stereotyped (eg, numbness of the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body, or hemiparesis). In contrast, attacks due to large artery occlusive disease have different symptoms in different attacks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the carotid artery is narrowed or occluded, patients may have monocular blindness on the side of the occlusive lesion, weakness of the contralateral hand, or aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive lesions of the internal carotid artery in the neck or head, or of its major intracranial branches, the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, cause loss of cerebral hemisphere functions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive lesions of the vertebral arteries in the head and neck and of the basilar artery cause brainstem and cerebellar symptoms and deficits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive disease of the posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) causes visual and somatosensory symptoms due to loss of function in the lateral thalamus and occipital lobe regions supplied by the PCAs.</p><p/><p>Thus, some TIAs, such as those causing transient monocular blindness, diplopia, and aphasia, are very specific for one vascular territory, while others, such as limb weakness or numbness, are compatible with a number of different territories.</p><p>The occurrence of a TIA is not helpful in predicting the presence of brain damage, the cause and mechanism of the ischemia, or the prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Transient brain ischemia can be caused by a variety of different conditions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain embolism arising from the heart, aorta, or proximal arterial vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive lesions of either large extracranial or intracranial arteries. These large artery lesions are associated with intermittent hypoperfusion of the symptomatic regions of the brain, or with embolization of fibrin-platelet (white thrombi) or erythrocyte-fibrin (red thrombi) clots into the distal brain circulation. Emboli often break up or pass through the vasculature, explaining the transiency of the neurologic symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive lesions (either lipohyalinosis or atheromatous branch disease) of small microscopic-sized intracranial arteries and arterioles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercoagulability and diseases that cause thrombosis of small vessels (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSIENT NEUROLOGIC EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of TIAs includes all other causes of transient &quot;spells&quot;.

Certain disorders may also cause both focal and nonfocal attacks. Seizures, for example, can begin and remain focal or can be generalized. Similarly, patients with hypoglycemia usually have global deficits in alertness and cognition, but on occasion can have focal symptoms such as hemiplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;transient neurological attack&quot; (TNA) has been proposed to describe sudden neurologic symptoms that completely resolve within 24 hours, with no clear evidence to support a diagnosis of migraine, epilepsy, M&eacute;ni&egrave;re disease, hyperventilation, cardiac syncope, hypoglycemia, or orthostatic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The symptoms of TNAs can be focal, nonfocal, or mixed. In this classification, focal TNAs represent TIAs, while TNAs with nonfocal or mixed symptoms are heterogeneous in terms of etiology. Like TIAs, both nonfocal and mixed TNAs appear to be associated with an increased risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, some patients diagnosed with TNAs by experienced stroke neurologists have evidence of acute ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Auras are thought to be caused by cortical spreading depression occurring in regions of the cortex that correspond to the clinical manifestations of the aura.</p><p>Auras typically occur before the onset of migraine headache, and the headache usually begins simultaneously with or just after the end of the aura phase. However, headache onset can rarely occur an hour or more after the end of the aura phase. Although atypical, an aura can develop during or after the onset of headache, and many patients have migraine aura with only a minimal or no headache.</p><p>Most migraine auras resolve in 20 to 30 minutes and seldom last more than one hour.

Seizures occasionally cause paralytic attacks but, on close observation, there are usually features of the history and physical examination that suggest the presence of a seizure disorder such as minor twitching of a finger or toe or a tingling sensation in the affected limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Progression and course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The progression and course of the symptoms are also helpful in the differential diagnosis. Migraine aura often progresses slowly within one modality. As an example, scintillations or bright objects tend to move slowly across the visual field. Paresthesia may gradually progress from one finger, to all the digits, to the wrist, forearm, shoulder, trunk, and then the face and leg. This progression normally occurs over minutes. After the positive symptoms move, they are often followed by loss of function. The moving train of visual scintillations may end in a scotoma or visual field defect. Similarly, as paresthesia travel centripetally, they may leave the initial areas of skin numb and devoid of feeling.</p><p>Migrainous aura typically progresses from one modality to another; after the visual symptoms clear, paresthesia begins. When paresthesia clear, aphasia or other cortical function abnormalities may develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>In contrast to migraine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures usually consist of positive phenomena in one modality which progress very quickly during seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIA symptoms are negative; when more than one modality or function is involved, all are affected at about the same time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of consciousness is very common in seizures and syncope, which usually produce relatively stereotyped attacks; in comparison, loss of consciousness is extremely rare in TIAs, and symptoms can be stereotyped or different in various TIAs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration and tempo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration and tempo of attacks also are useful in predicting the cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migrainous auras characteristically last 20 to 30 minutes, although they may persist for hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIAs are usually fleeting, almost always lasting less than one hour</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures last on average about 30 seconds to 3 minutes; some seizures, including absence attacks, atonic seizures and myoclonic jerks, are shorter in duration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope is very brief (seconds) unless the patient is artificially propped up or otherwise cannot obtain a supine position</p><p/><p>Seizures occur sporadically over the years but sometimes appear in flurries.

Seizures occur at any age, while TIAs are not very common in young individuals, particularly those who do not have prominent risk factors for vascular disease (eg, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, cardiac disease, sickle cell disease, etc). In otherwise healthy women who are pregnant, transient focal neurologic symptoms are often related to migraine with aura, and usually have a benign outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Syncope has little predilection for age, but is more common in women. TIAs and strokes are somewhat more common in men, although after menopause the frequencies are nearly equal in the two sexes.

Other disorders that have acute onset and cause persistent focal signs should be considered in the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracerebral hemorrhages usually develop during minutes and cause gradually increasing focal signs. Patients with large hemorrhages often develop headache, vomiting, and reduced consciousness; these findings are typically absent in patients with small hemorrhages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain tumors can cause an abrupt onset or worsening of symptoms; hemorrhage into a tumor is one mechanism for such a change. In addition, some tumors which are outside the brain (eg, meningiomas) reach a critical mass and can cause abrupt displacement of brain tissue with the sudden onset of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonketotic hyperglycemic stupor is often associated with focal neurologic signs; there may be a focal region of brain edema on brain imaging tests.

Most often however, MS attacks develop over 5 to 21 days, a longer period than strokes. MS is most common in the third to fifth decades of life, while the frequency of stroke peaks later. A history of prior attacks is very important in making the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demyelination can occur around veins after various viral infections which result in the abrupt onset of multifocal signs that develop over days. This disorder is often called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Other viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus, can cause focal brain lesions associated with focal neurologic signs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain abscesses cause focal neurologic symptoms and signs which can begin abruptly; fever, headache, and seizures are common accompanying signs.

Ischemic stroke is defined as an infarction of central nervous system tissue. The symptoms of TIAs are typically focal and depend upon the underlying vascular cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71676 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transient ischemic attack'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to TIA, the most important and frequent causes of discrete self-limited attacks include seizure, migraine aura, and syncope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111740\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111740 \">table 2</a>). Transient global amnesia or TGA is an uncommon syndrome characterized by the acute onset of temporary but severe anterograde amnesia accompanied by retrograde amnesia, without other cognitive or focal neurologic impairment. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Transient neurologic events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other less frequent causes of transient neurologic events include hypoglycemia, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, subdural hematoma, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, various toxic or metabolic encephalopathies, compressive myelopathy, nerve root compression, peripheral vestibulopathies, and psychogenic etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Useful features for distinguishing the various causes of transient attacks include the focal or nonfocal nature of attacks, the nature of the symptoms and their progression, the duration and timing of symptoms, and associated symptoms during and after the attacks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111740\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111740 \">table 2</a>). Some disorders cause focal abnormalities of brain function, while others cause dysfunction that is either widespread or difficult to localize to any one anatomic region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62326 \">table 3</a>). Certain disorders may cause both focal and nonfocal attacks. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing transient attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic stroke is characterized by the abrupt or at least very acute onset of focal neurologic symptoms and signs that leave persistent neurologic deficits. Other disorders that have acute onset and cause persistent focal signs should be considered in the differential diagnosis, including intracerebral hemorrhage, brain tumor, nonketotic hyperglycemic stupor, attacks of multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and brain abscess.
