This topic review will provide an overview of the treatment of this disorder; its pathogenesis and clinical features are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2575390291\" class=\"local\">'Direct effect of type of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In some patients, orbitopathy changes little for many years. In others, it may worsen or improve or, in a few patients, follow a course characterized by exacerbations and remissions. These variations make it especially difficult to reach conclusions about the efficacy of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>One study, as an example, evaluated 237 patients with newly diagnosed Graves' hyperthyroidism who were treated with thionamides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At initial presentation, the majority (73.7 percent) of patients had no ocular involvement, whereas mild, moderate-to-severe, and sight-threatening orbitopathy were present in 20, 5.8, and 0.3 percent of patients, respectively. During the 18-month follow-up period, progression to moderate-to-severe orbitopathy occurred in 2.6 percent of patients with no orbitopathy at baseline and in 2.4 percent of patients with mild activity at baseline. In contrast, 58 percent of patients with mild disease at baseline experienced complete remission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3195641068\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of patients with Graves' orbitopathy includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversal of hyperthyroidism, if present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring for and prompt treatment of hypothyroidism, occurring as a consequence of treating hyperthyroidism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cessation of smoking, if applicable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local measures to reduce ocular surface irritation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of inflammation and swelling in the periorbital tissues</p><p/><p>Patients with Graves' orbitopathy should be treated according to the severity of their eye disease, keeping in mind its natural history. Most patients have mild disease, with no progression during follow-up, and may be treated with local measures alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2032524398\" class=\"local\">'Local measures'</a> below). Patients with moderate orbitopathy frequently require immunomodulatory therapy, and those with severe orbitopathy frequently require surgical rehabilitation. The natural history of orbitopathy is such that the inflammatory manifestations of the disorder (eye irritation and conjunctival and periorbital edema) tend to subside, whereas proptosis and extraocular eye muscle dysfunction persist.</p><p>The treatment strategy outlined below is largely consistent with guidelines from the American Thyroid Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and European Thyroid Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversal of hyperthyroidism, if present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Euthyroidism should be restored in all patients with hyperthyroidism. The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism consists of both rapid amelioration of hyperthyroid symptoms with a beta blocker and measures aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone synthesis with the administration of a thionamide, radioiodine ablation, or surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment#H27895232\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1207063421\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of hyperthyroidism therapy on orbitopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The question of whether hyperthyroidism treatment influences Graves' orbitopathy is complex.

Hypothyroidism, should it develop during the course of therapy for hyperthyroidism, can cause more fluid retention and may have an adverse effect on the orbitopathy. Therefore, during and after treatment of hyperthyroidism, patients require monitoring for and prompt treatment of hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=graves-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults-overview-of-treatment#H2639116\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment&quot;, section on 'Monitoring after treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2575390291\"><span class=\"h4\">Direct effect of type of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graves' orbitopathy may worsen or first become apparent after treatment of hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. A randomized trial, as an example, evaluated 168 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, 22 of whom had preexisting orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Correction of the hyperthyroidism was associated with new onset of orbitopathy in 22 (15 percent) and worsening of the orbitopathy in 8 of 22 (36 percent). The worsening was manifested in most patients by an extra 1 to 2 mm of proptosis.</p><p>The initial effect of therapy on orbitopathy varies with the type of treatment. Treatment with total or subtotal thyroidectomy or thionamides does not appear to have a negative influence on the course of orbitopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Treatment with one of these modalities is usually followed by a fall in serum thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) concentrations, suggesting a waning of autoimmunity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F115288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115288 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Radioiodine therapy, however, can cause a rise in TRAb levels and the development or worsening of Graves' orbitopathy more often than thionamides or surgery. This issue is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism#H30632428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Radioiodine and orbitopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3007232970\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of hyperthyroidism therapy in patients with orbitopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graves' hyperthyroidism can be treated with a thionamide, radioactive iodine, or thyroidectomy. Because radioiodine therapy can cause the development or worsening of Graves' orbitopathy more often than thionamides or surgery, moderate-to-severe or sight-threatening orbitopathy is a contraindication to radioiodine therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism#H30632428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Radioiodine and orbitopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with active and moderate-to-severe or sight-threatening orbitopathy, thionamides or surgery are the preferred treatment options. Patients who refuse surgery and who have contraindications to thionamides may need to be offered radioiodine therapy with steroid coverage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism#H1893065532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids in patients with orbitopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with active, mild orbitopathy may still be candidates for thionamides, radioiodine, or surgery.

Total thyroidectomy eliminates more thyroid antigens than subtotal thyroidectomy, resulting in progressive decreases in antibodies to all major thyroid antigens and especially to the thyrotropin receptor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F115288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115288 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

However, in another study, patients who had a total versus a subtotal thyroidectomy when compared after three years were found to have similar improvement in orbitopathy (and surgical complications were higher in the total thyroidectomy group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In a small study of patients with mild-to-moderate orbitopathy, near-total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine was associated with less active orbitopathy than near-total thyroidectomy alone; both groups received intravenous (IV) steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a one-year study of thyroidectomy alone versus thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine ablation of surgical remnants using recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH), 75 percent of patients who received radioiodine after thyroidectomy had inactive eye disease versus 30 percent of the patients who had only a thyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1648324873\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be advised to discontinue smoking as cigarette smoking increases the incidence of symptomatic Graves' orbitopathy and also renders patients more refractory to antiinflammatory therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Since participating centers in the selenium trial were located in areas of relative selenium insufficiency, it is not known whether similar results would be found in selenium-rich regions (eg, most of the United States). There were no adverse effects of selenium treatment in any of the Graves' orbitopathy studies to date, but selenium use has been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H16253594\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Selenium'</a>). Some UpToDate authors and editors suggest a six-month trial of selenium in patients with mild orbitopathy, while others would not suggest selenium for patients residing in selenium-replete areas, such as the United States.</p><p>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors, may also be helpful in some patients with mild symptoms of eye irritation, although there are no clinical trials supporting their use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229418764\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate-to-severe or progressive symptoms</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> &ndash; For the patient with moderate symptoms (inflamed eyes and increasing diplopia or proptosis [&ge;3 mm above upper limit of normal for race], mild corneal irritation), a trial of oral (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for four weeks) or IV (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, 500 mg for weeks 1 to 6, then 250 mg for weeks 7 to 12 with cumulative dose 4.5 to 5 g over 12 weeks) glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated.
