These cells are made in the center of your bones, in a part called the bone marrow. When people have CLL, their bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells. These abnormal blood cells grow out of control, get into the blood, and travel around the body. Sometimes, these cells collect in certain parts of the body.</p><p>When the bone marrow makes abnormal blood cells, it does not make enough of the normal blood cells a person's body needs. This can cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396896\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of CLL?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CLL does not usually cause symptoms when it is in the early stages, and people might not know that they have it. Many times, people are diagnosed after having routine blood tests.</p><p>When CLL does cause symptoms, the most common ones are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired and weak</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin &ndash; Lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs that are part of the body's infection-fighting system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting sick from infections more easily than normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fevers, drenching sweats at night, and losing weight without trying to</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396903\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for CLL?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you, do an exam, and do blood tests. He or she might also do a bone marrow biopsy. For this test, a doctor takes a very small sample of the bone marrow. Then another doctor will look at the cells under a microscope to see if abnormal (cancer) cells are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396910\"><span class=\"h1\">How is CLL treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat CLL in different ways. Sometimes, doctors do not treat CLL right away. Your doctor might not treat your CLL right away if it is slow-growing and not causing any symptoms. But your doctor will watch your CLL closely by doing exams and blood tests until treatment is needed.</p><p>CLL is usually treated if it is causing symptoms or growing fast. Most patients with CLL are treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. There are many different chemotherapy drugs that are used to treat CLL. Your doctor will work with you to choose the ones that are right for you.</p><p>When people have chemotherapy, they can get sick from infections more easily than normal. Because of this, it's important to wash your hands often and stay away from people who are sick. Let your doctor or nurse know right away if you get a fever. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396917\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Regular follow-ups include talking with your doctor, exams, and blood tests. Sometimes, your doctor will also do a bone marrow biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396924\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the CLL comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the CLL comes back, your doctor will talk with you about other possible treatments. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; You might get the same chemotherapy medicines that you got before, or you might get different ones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant (also called &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;) &ndash; This treatment replaces cells in the bone marrow that are killed by chemotherapy or radiation. These &quot;donor&quot; cells come from another person whose blood matches yours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove an organ called the spleen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments to reduce symptoms &ndash; For example, your doctor can give you medicines to help reduce the number of infections that you get.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396931\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for CLL involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13396938\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukemia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Leukemia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hairy-cell-leukemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hairy cell leukemia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-cll-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
