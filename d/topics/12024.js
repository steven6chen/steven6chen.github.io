Many occupations have been anecdotally linked to certain musculoskeletal disorders, such as &quot;policeman's heel&quot; or &quot;deliveryman's back.&quot; For some pain disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, the relationship of the condition to specific patterns of work is better established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For other disorders, however, the relationship between the work environment and the patient's symptoms, though clearly perceived by the patient to be causative, may be less certain.</p><p>Determining whether a patient's low back pain is a consequence of his or her occupational activity, and how best to treat symptoms to maximize functionality and potential for a return to full employment capacity, can be challenging. Many physicians, including those practicing in primary care settings where back pain is most often seen, lack training and confidence in addressing workplace issues.</p><p>This topic will address evaluation of work-related low back pain. Treatment of work-related low back pain is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-low-back-pain-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational low back pain: Treatment&quot;</a>.) The evaluation of low back pain in the general setting is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THE INJURY MODEL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The injury model of an occupational disorder proposes that specific work activities are the cause of the patient's pain. The injury model for low back pain, implicating a causal connection with specific work activities, is complex and controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Multiple factors and lines of evidence challenge this model, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low back pain is a ubiquitous complaint, with particularly high prevalence among people in their working years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most workers, a specific cause of low back pain cannot be identified with certainty. The development of back pain at work may simply reflect the large percentage of waking hours spent at work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical, ergonomic and injury factors appear to have less influence in predicting outcomes in people thought to have occupational low back pain than psychosocial and socioeconomic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain is frequently episodic. Although most episodes improve within three months, recurrence over the next year is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p/><p>Studies of work-related disability indicate that the longer a patient is off work, the smaller is the probability of return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This observation has led to the hypothesis that early workplace intervention may reduce long-term disability and promote return to work. Trials of workplace interventions offer some support for this concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE DISABILITY COMPENSATION SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Provisions for compensation for disability differ among countries, and may impact the frequency of claims for disability and duration of work impairment. The two main features of disability compensation are the replacement of lost income and the provision of care for occupational injury or disease. Decisions regarding the amount of compensation are generally governed by legal frameworks, such as &quot;no fault&quot; insurance, which require adjudication by a judge or administrator working within an administrative tribunal system. These decisions rely on an interpretation or the definition of &quot;disability&quot;, which may be statutorily defined.</p><p>Medical care and rehabilitation may be provided outside or within the general health care system, depending to a large part on the mix of &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot; health care in the local jurisdiction. In many developed countries, the disability system is a function of the national government. In such systems, disability assessment and compensation are more integrated with the health care system, since the government is the single payor for disability and healthcare. Governances also differ on whether disability awards are determined by a tort system or on a no fault basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Whether or not particular systems impact the extent of worker's disability and compensation is a matter of health care policy debate.</p><p>In the United States, workers' compensation is a state-based program for individuals who claim that their condition is directly attributable to their employment. Workers compensation insurance generally provides both medical benefits and income replacement (also called indemnity or wage loss) for patients who are disabled due to a work injury. Income replacement typically requires that an insurance claim be filed and accepted by an adjudicator. The worker generally has the right to appeal a decision to reject a claim, which often generates requests for additional medical information or assessments.</p><p>Private disability insurance can be purchased by individuals (typically through their employer) and covers non-work related illnesses and provides wage replacement but not medical benefits. Social security disability insurance is a program of the US government that provides long-term wage replacement for those permanently injured, and health insurance through the Medicare program after a delay period.</p><p>The primary care physician often sees the patient soon after low back pain begins. It is important to inquire whether a claim is being made, to whom (workers' compensation, private disability insurance or social security disability), the claim's current status and whether litigation (a lawyer) is involved. The patient and injury history should be carefully documented.</p><p>A key part of any disability claim involves a period of time (varying by jurisdiction) before the claim can be filed. The adjudication period for a pending claim can be stressful, especially for patients who are temporarily without income. The clinician should be sensitive to the potential for financial or psychological stress related to the pending claim.</p><p>There are often multiple stakeholders in the disability process, depending on the nature of the disability plan. At a minimum, these include an <span class=\"nowrap\">adjudicator/case</span> manager from the insurer, the employer, a clinician, and the patient. Other stakeholders may include a labor union representative, the employer's occupational health and safety department, and other health care and legal practitioners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Despite common perceptions, most individuals with occupational injuries recover completely and those receiving workers' compensation return to their usual job.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical evaluation of patients with acute, subacute or chronic low back pain is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When low back pain interferes with a patient's ability to work, the physician may need to address factors beyond the standard medical evaluation. These can include financial issues, timing of return to work, the need for work accommodations, and third party disability issues.</p><p>The clinician may feel that he or she has become part of an adversarial system between the patient, employer, and disability insurer. This has the potential to undermine trust between a patient and his or her primary care clinician. The broad perspective of a primary care physician can help maintain a focus on the best interests of the patient, even when medicolegal issues are superimposed on the usual process for evaluation and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>The task of coordinating documents and keeping stakeholders informed of the status of a disability claim often falls on the primary care physician. Thus a key step in the evaluation of occupational low back pain is inquiring about disability claims and identifying what documents the clinician will need to provide and when. Although time consuming, ensuring that all specialists reports are received and reviewed with the patient can minimize misunderstandings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key to the assessment of a patient with occupational low back pain is being aware from the outset that the pain may be work-related. It should not be assumed that the patient would unfailingly volunteer such information. All working individuals who initially present with low back pain should be directly asked whether they believe the injury to be work-related. For patients responding affirmatively, relevant history for the following areas should be reviewed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of the work incident, including the date, time, and specific circumstances. The goal is to clearly document the patient's recollection of the event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the patient is currently working, and if so whether work modifications have been made.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether a work incident report has been filed and whether a workers' compensation claim exists. If it does, ask about the details of its status (pending, appeal, approved) and whether the patient has an insurance form to be completed. Inquire whether the patient has filed a prior claim or previously been on disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the patient's current status and the history of his or her symptoms since their onset. The history should be descriptive, without attributing the symptoms to a specific etiology (such as describing the pain as a &quot;strain&quot;). Clarify the location, duration and nature of the pain. Discuss aggravating and alleviating factors, including prior treatments received [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess any prior evaluation and diagnostics tests and their results.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination for an individual with occupational low back pain should cover five broad domains:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal, neurological and other diagnoses (including &quot;red flags&quot; for potentially serious diseases)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational impact</p><p/><p>As for all patients with low back pain, the history should focus on identifying the rare but serious conditions (&quot;red flags&quot;) in addition to psychosocial risk factors for persistent pain.

In one study, functional improvement and return to work were more strongly predicted by employment and psychosocial factors (job tenure, physical work demands, self-rated pain and mood) than by health history or physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. One study found an inverse association between social support and recovery from low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], while another study identified supervisory support, but not coworker support, as a factor promoting earlier return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Psychosocial factors that suggest increased risk for persistent pain and that should be evaluated include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor control of one's job environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short job attachment (recent hire)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited work <span class=\"nowrap\">skills/experience</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear avoidance behaviors (apprehension about reactivation); examples include guarded movements, changing position to get up due to fear of pain recurrence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance use</p><p/><p>These psychosocial factors are more likely to predict prolonged disability than the nature of the low back injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. While psychosocial risk factors have been associated with persistence of low back pain, no widely disseminated patient instruments exist for their assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Appropriate screening tools for depression and substance abuse are available.

Inquiry should be made whether other individuals at the same job have similar pain complaints.</p><p>One approach used in occupational health settings to assess and monitor the worker's pain symptoms is the 5As: analgesia, activity, adverse effects, aberrant behavior, and affect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesia &ndash; What is the level of pain?

For most patients with low back pain, whether occupationally related or not, a specific diagnosis cannot be identified with certainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/6,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34</a>].</p><p>The physical examination, as in all patients with back pain, should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspection of back and posture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of motion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of the spine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Straight leg raising (for patients with leg symptoms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic assessment of L5 and S1 roots (for patients with leg symptoms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for malignancy (breast, prostate, lymph node exam) when persistent pain or history strongly suggests systemic disease</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Key aspects of the examination of patients with occupational low back pain are observation and recording of the patient's ability to perform routine activities (eg, rising from a chair, bending, squatting) and the patient's pain response to such activities.</p><p>In addition to the history of psychosocial risk factors, physical examination findings associated with persistent pain should be assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Sometimes a patient may even ask for tests or state that his or her lawyer specifically requests certain tests. However, the diagnostic approach to these patients should be no different than for any other patient with low back pain.</p><p>A conservative approach to imaging for low back pain is indicated for several compelling reasons, including: low yield for findings that will change management, poor correlation between symptoms and anatomical findings, lack of impact on outcomes, and radiation exposure.</p><p>The primary care physician should state explicitly when imaging is not warranted by clinical history or findings of the physical examination. Occasionally, in adversarial medicolegal cases, the physician may be asked to perform a test for evaluation as part of a legal document.

If the patient's perception is at odds with that of the primary care clinician, the basis for the patient's belief should be explored. The patient may have unrealistic expectations about return to work or fears about the seriousness of the low back pain.</p><p>For most patients, this should be the start of a discussion about the patient's goals for return to work.

Returning patients who have persistent back pain may meet criteria for subacute or chronic low back pain. Subacute low back pain is commonly defined as back pain lasting between 4 and 12 weeks and chronic low back pain as pain that persists for 12 or more weeks.</p><p>Diagnostic testing and referring for treatment are often initiated at follow-up, if symptoms persist. As previously noted, diagnostic testing should not differ in those with or without occupational low back pain. Treatment of subacute and chronic low back pain are described separately.

The patient's disability insurer often will arrange for an occupational medicine assessment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> independent medical examination (IME). This evaluation may involve a team of allied health professionals (including physical and occupational therapist, psychologist, and social worker), and focus in greater detail than the primary clinician's assessment on aspects of the occupational low back pain. The outside evaluation may include a more detailed review of return to work and fitness to work issues, performing a job demands analysis, formal functional status testing, and developing a medical care plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Activity prescription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activity prescription or fitness to work forms are often required when disability becomes prolonged.

Completion of these forms can be important for the patient and also provides the clinician with a means to communicate with the insurer or employer on behalf of his or her patient.</p><p>These documents can be long, detailed and ask for items the primary care clinician is uncertain about. The questions can sometimes seem arbitrary and have no clear medical answer, but a reasonable goal is for the physician to try and convey a general impression of the patient's abilities.</p><p>Since most primary care physicians will not perform a formal ergonomic assessment to indicate duration of <span class=\"nowrap\">standing/sitting/bending</span> or the amount of weight that can be carried and for how long, it is reasonable to focus on the activities that the patient needs to do as part of his or her job and to comment specifically on the ability to perform those activities. As an example, if a patient works at a desk job, stating the patient can sit for eight hours a day implies that the patient is able to return to work. If a patient is required to carry 50 pound boxes, stating that the patient cannot lift anything more than 20 pounds implies that the patient is not able to return to his or her usual job. Limiting responses to such key activities can save the physician time and still provide the information needed to assess the individual's ability to work.</p><p>Recommendations for return to work or ongoing disability can be difficult for the primary care clinician to make, but focusing on what the patient reports, what the clinician observes, and one's knowledge of the patient can help advocate in a balanced manner. Completing activity forms using examples from the patient's history (eg, &quot;able to hold baby for 10 minutes&quot; or &quot;able to vacuum and do dishes but with pain&quot;) can be helpful to the disability provider. Sometimes, the physician can only honestly answer &quot;I don't know&quot; when asked to estimate a patient's lifting capacity. More formal assessment will be arranged by insurers when fitness to work is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is often difficult to determine whether a specific work incident is the source of a patient's back pain, given the high prevalence of back pain in the general population, its episodic nature, and that psychosocial factors are better predictors of return to work than physical or ergonomic factors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'The injury model'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should be knowledgeable about the disability system for compensation that may be involved in the patient's condition, and should be sensitive to the potential for patient financial or psychological stress related to a pending claim. In addition to providing appropriate medical care, the primary care physician must balance communication among stakeholders with appropriate medical confidentiality. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'The disability compensation system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial assessment of any patient with low back pain should include direct inquiry whether the patient thinks the pain may be work-related. If so, specific inquiry into the work incident, compensation status, and prior claim history is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient history should focus on possible &quot;red flags&quot; for serious medical diagnoses, psychosocial factors, pain, functional impairment, and occupational impact. The physical examination should include all components of a usual examination for low back pain, and evaluate whether signs of nonorganic disease are present. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The criteria for ordering an imaging test or other diagnostic study in a patient with possible work-related low back pain should not differ from criteria for patients with nonoccupational low back pain. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment should conclude by comparing the reported and observed functional limitations to the patient's reported job demands. If the patient's perception is at odds with that of the clinician, the basis for the patient's belief should be explored. Follow-up should be arranged for all patients with work-related low back pain. More formal assessment will be arranged by insurers when fitness to work is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Completing the assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295167066\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Donald Krawciw, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Palmer KT, Harris EC, Coggon D.
