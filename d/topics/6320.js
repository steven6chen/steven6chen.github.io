The abdominal aorta is the most common site of true arterial aneurysm affecting predominantly the segment of aorta below the renal arteries (infrarenal aorta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Well-defined risk factors are associated with the development of AAA and include advanced age, male gender, Caucasian race, a positive family history, smoking, the presence of other large vessel aneurysms, and atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].<sup> </sup>The Centers for Disease Control ranked AAA as the 15<sup>th</sup> leading cause of mortality in the United States in 2013 in adults between 60 and 64 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p>AAAs progressively dilate over time. While expansion rates vary, large aneurysms generally expand at a faster rate than small aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Mechanisms for the development, expansion, and rupture of AAA have been validated in animal models. However, the relative contribution of these in humans is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The main risk factors associated with expansion and rupture of AAA are somewhat different from those that contribute to the development of AAA and include large aneurysm diameter, rapid expansion, smoking, hypertension, elevated peak wall stress, a history of cardiac or renal transplant, decreased forced expiratory volume, and female gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. While there is significant overlap, the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of the development of AAA differ somewhat from the natural history of expansion and rupture and will therefore be discussed separately.</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of AAA are reviewed here. The diagnosis, management, and treatment of AAA are discussed in detail elsewhere. Definitions of aneurysms by their location relative to the visceral vessels, involvement of the vessel layer walls, morphology (saccular versus fusiform), and diameter (small versus large) are described in detail elsewhere.

However, AAAs found on screening are generally small; those measuring &ge;5.5 cm or greater are found in only 0.4 to 0.6 percent of those screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Because the incidence of AAA rises sharply in individuals over 60 years of age, the future prevalence of AAA could increase substantially in association with the aging population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. On the other hand, some suggest that a reduction in the prevalence of smoking could have the opposite effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F87502\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87502 \">figure 2</a>), with several studies citing a lower prevalence of AAA in 65- to 80-year-old Caucasian adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p>The annual incidence of new AAA diagnoses is approximately 0.4 to 0.67 percent in Western populations.

Age significantly impacts the incidence. As an example, in one study, among men aged 65 to 74 years, the incidence was 55 per 100,000 person-years, increasing to 112 per 100,000 person-years for men aged 75 to 85 years, and further increasing to 298 per 100,000 person-years for those older than 85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1780134620\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for the development of AAA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is significant overlap between the risk factors that contribute to the development of AAA and the risk factors that contribute to the expansion and rupture of AAA. However, the relative contribution of each risk factor to either the development or the expansion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture of AAA varies. Tobacco abuse appears to be the main modifiable risk factor for the development of AAA. Protective factors for the development of AAA include female gender, non-Caucasian race, diabetes, and moderate alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Among males aged between 65 and 80 years, the prevalence of AAA is 4 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Aneurysms are rare in women less than 50 years of age. The prevalence of AAA in 65- to 80-year-old women is four to six times lower compared with their male counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Since prevalence studies have defined aneurysm as aortic diameter &ge;30 mm, the true prevalence of AAA in women may be underestimated because of differences in body size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4128792730\"><span class=\"h3\">Caucasian race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AAA occurs most frequently among non-Hispanic white Americans or Caucasians of European descent.

Smoking cessation decreases the subsequent odds of AAA being identified on screening, with the greatest benefit among those who have quit for more than 10 years. Unfortunately, the odds never return to the baseline of nonsmokers, indicating that some degree of damage inflicted by tobacco use is permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796686455\"><span class=\"h3\">Presence of other large vessel aneurysms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with other large vessel aneurysms (such as iliac, femoral, popliteal, or carotid artery aneurysms) have an increased risk for AAA.

Some authors posit that the protective effect may be mediated by the increased arterial stiffness induced by diabetes upon the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].<sup> </sup>It is unclear whether diabetes decreases rupture risk when controlling for aneurysm diameter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although coronary artery disease and systemic atherosclerosis appear to be associated with the development of AAA, coronary artery disease may not be associated with expansion or rupture of AAA. A meta-analysis found a negative association between a history of coronary artery disease and AAA expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Future appropriately powered studies that clearly define the severity of systemic atherosclerosis will be required to quantify the true role of atherosclerosis upon AAA expansion and rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1647008825\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which is a focal dilation more than 50 percent greater than the normal diameter of the aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60682 \">figure 1</a>), is a common but potentially lethal condition. The abdominal aorta is the most common site of true arterial aneurysm affecting predominantly the segment of aorta below the renal arteries (infrarenal aorta). (See <a href=\"#H3810955513\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound screening studies have found that 4 to 8 percent of older men have an occult AAA. Although the prevalence of AAA is four to six times lower for women compared with men, women present with rupture more often than men. (See <a href=\"#H1917361352\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1066536637\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of AAA rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main risk factors for developing AAA include advancing age, male gender, Caucasian race, family history, smoking, the presence of other large vessel aneurysm, and atherosclerotic risk factors. Although diabetes mellitus is consistently a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis, it is negatively associated with the development of AAA. (See <a href=\"#H1780134620\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for the development of AAA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aneurysmal degeneration of the abdominal aorta is a multifactorial systemic process due to alterations in vascular wall biology. AAAs are characterized by transmural inflammatory changes, abnormal collagen remodeling and cross-linking, and loss of elastin and smooth muscle cells, which results in progressive thinning and weakening of the aortic wall and enlargement of the aortic diameter. (See <a href=\"#H2834861604\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of AAA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple factors influence aortic expansion and the risk of rupture, the most important of which are aortic diameter and ongoing smoking. Small and medium-sized AAAs (&lt;5.5 cm) expand at an average rate of 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span> while larger AAAs expand at approximately 3 to 4 mm per year. AAAs that exhibit rapid diameter expansion &ge;5 mm over six months or &gt;10 mm over one year of follow-up have an increased risk for rupture. (See <a href=\"#H1614399424\" class=\"local\">'Expansion and rupture of AAA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150879471\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
