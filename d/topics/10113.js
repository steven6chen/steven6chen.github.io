It has been used as a general term to refer to any combination of urinary symptoms or as a more specific term to refer to those symptoms primarily associated with overactive bladder (frequency, urgency, and nocturia). An international consensus conference defined LUTS to include symptoms relating to storage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> voiding disturbances common among aging men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

LUTS often has a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life. A survey of over 5000 community-dwelling men age &ge;65 in the United States without history of prostate cancer found that 46 percent reported moderate to severe LUTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another community-based study found that the prevalence of LUTS increases steadily with age into the 10<sup>th</sup> decade, affecting 70 percent of men older than 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) appears to be a risk factor for LUTS, but the presence of urinary symptoms is not explained by the degree of glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This relationship was strongest in younger men (&lt;70 years old) and in those with longstanding (&gt;5 years) disease. Other conditions associated with LUTS include cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and erectile dysfunction. Although the pathophysiologic connection of LUTS to erectile dysfunction is not clearly defined, this observation has resulted in new approaches to the evaluation and management of both disorders.</p><p>Increased fluid intake and caffeine use have been associated with urinary frequency and urgency, and modest alcohol use (one to three drinks per day) has been associated with decreased LUTS in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376939113\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) can be categorized as symptoms related to storage, voiding, or post micturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Men with LUTS may report one or any combination of symptoms. LUTS typically fluctuate over time and may remit spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. LUTS are associated with severe sleep disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], increased depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and decreased ability to perform activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Storage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Storage symptoms, experienced during the bladder filling and storage phase of micturition, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgency &ndash; A sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daytime frequency &ndash; A patient's perception that he voids too often by day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturia &ndash; The need to wake at night one or more times to void</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incontinence &ndash; Involuntary leakage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal bladder sensation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Voiding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Voiding symptoms are those experienced at the time of urine flow and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow stream &ndash; The individual's perception of reduced urine flow, usually compared with previous performance and sometimes compared with observations of other men.

However, the significance of other etiologies for voiding dysfunction is increasingly recognized. Overactive bladder (OAB), characterized by involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscle, may be the principal cause or a contributory cause of LUTS in some men. Careful evaluation is indicated to identify the primary factors responsible for LUTS in an individual patient in order to target appropriate treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder outlet obstruction from BPH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LUTS with symptoms of BOO in men traditionally have been attributed to an enlarged prostate or benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). BPH refers to a specific histologic diagnosis, although the term is commonly used interchangeably with benign prostatic enlargement despite the absence of tissue confirmation. We will use BPH here as synonymous with BPE.</p><p>Clinically significant BPH presents as LUTS with a predominance of voiding symptoms. Patients experience progressive symptoms that can range from nocturia to acute urinary retention and may include incomplete emptying, urinary hesitancy, weak stream, frequency, and urgency. Long-term or chronic BOO may eventually lead to <span class=\"nowrap\">bladder/detrusor</span> decompensation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Detrusor overactivity following BOO'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation for BPH are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of bladder outlet obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other conditions that may cause BOO in men include urethral stricture, primary bladder neck obstruction, bladder neck contracture, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, prostate cancer, and, less likely, meatal stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OAB is defined by the International Continence Society as a syndrome of urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually accompanied by increased frequency during both daytime and nighttime nocturia. Although overactive bladder is typically associated with storage symptoms rather than voiding symptoms, OAB often accounts for symptoms in men who are thought to have BOO but who fail to respond to therapy.</p><p>The incidence of OAB and LUTS symptoms is the same for older adult men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Urgency, urgency incontinence, and frequency have been reported in 10 to 13 percent of European men 50 to 59 years old and in 18 percent of American men 45 to 54 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The prevalence of OAB rises with increasing age.</p><p>Typically, the storage symptoms of OAB are more bothersome than the voiding symptoms of BPH. Men with OAB and urgency incontinence in particular have higher rates of depression and are more likely to alter activities (eg, decrease work hours, change employment, or take early voluntary retirement) compared with men with OAB who do not have incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>OAB symptoms are often attributed to detrusor overactivity, characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Uninhibited detrusor contractions can be detected on the cystometrogram portion of urodynamic testing.</p><p>OAB may be classified as either neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Although the specific mechanism triggering overactivity is essentially unknown, neurogenic OAB symptoms are thought to be related to decreased suprapontine inhibition of the micturition reflex, leading to enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in the micturition reflex pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Neurogenic causes include cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Non-neurogenic, or idiopathic, causes of OAB include BOO (usually secondary to BPH), postoperative pelvic surgery, and bladder stones or other foreign bodies.</p><p>Treatment modalities for OAB are directed principally at blocking the muscarinic receptor, the presumed site of neurogenically mediated detrusor overactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Detrusor overactivity following BOO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of OAB overlap with those attributed to BOO secondary to BPH. The incidence of detrusor overactivity with BOO has been reported to range from 30 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Because of the similarities and the overlap in symptoms of clinical BPH and OAB, it can be difficult to separate the two conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presence of both BOO and detrusor overactivity in an individual does not confirm causality. Nonetheless, animal models do suggest that BOO can lead to the development of detrusor dysfunction.</p><p>Tissue ischemia appears to play a central role in BOO-induced detrusor overactivity. Mild bladder distension can cause relative hypoxia in bladder muscle in a canine model, with documentation of reduced detrusor blood flow during filling of hypertrophic bladders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Tissue hypoxemia results from increased oxygen demand by hypertrophic tissue and diminished oxygen supply in the presence of elevated intravesical pressures. Vasodilatory substances, such as nitric oxide synthase, are found in bladder tissue shortly after obstruction and suggest induction of mechanisms to restore blood flow to underperfused areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is hypothesized that smooth muscle injury results from a cycle of relative tissue hypoxia during bladder distension, followed by reperfusion injury after micturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>].</p><p>BOO may also cause detrusor overactivity via cholinergic denervation of the detrusor muscle and consequent supersensitivity of muscarinic receptors to acetylcholine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Animal models suggest that increased bladder outlet resistance may also result in increased detrusor collagen content, changes in electrical properties of detrusor smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reorganization of the spinal micturition reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL PATIENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), whether to their primary care clinician or to a specialist, should undergo an initial evaluation including history and physical examination. It is important to determine the degree to which symptoms impact the quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>]. This assessment can be semiquantitative but may be facilitated by use of a structured questionnaire. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'International Prostate Symptom Score'</a> below.)</p><p>An algorithm for the initial management of LUTS in men has been developed by an international consortium representing multiple urological societies from Europe, the United States, Latin America, and Asia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57955\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57955 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3781438236\"><span class=\"h2\">History, physical, and testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History should include the onset, duration, and severity of symptoms. Medications should be reviewed, as antidepressants, diuretics, bronchodilators, and antihistamines are associated with LUTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Factors associated with urinary incontinence should be clearly ascertained, and patients should be questioned regarding any previous neurologic symptoms, injury, or disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-men#H711968508\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary incontinence in men&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Physical examination should include evaluation of the abdomen, pelvis, perineum, and a focused neurological exam. A more extensive neurologic examination is indicated for patients with possible neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. An attempt should be made to recreate activities that typically cause incontinence in the patient. Digital rectal exam should be performed to estimate prostate size and detect any abnormalities suggestive of prostate cancer.</p><p>Urinalysis is performed to evaluate for hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Urine cultures are not recommended routinely but should be included if bacteriuria or pyuria are present or if there is otherwise suspicion for a urinary tract infection.</p><p>Initial laboratory studies may also include blood tests for renal function and glucose. The American Urological Association (AUA) recommends against routinely checking creatinine during the initial evaluation of LUTS. However, reasons to consider measuring creatinine include evaluation of possible upper urinary tract deterioration (eg, hydronephrosis) or high postvoid residual (PVR) volumes due to bladder outlet obstruction.</p><p>The benefits and risks of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing should be discussed with the patient. PSA testing as a screen for prostate cancer should be considered only in patients with life expectancy greater than 10 years. Another indication for measuring PSA in men with LUTS without cancer is as a proxy for prostate volume. PSA is also needed before treatment with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, and monitoring for prostate cancer should be done during treatment, with the understanding that these medications effect the PSA levels. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'5-alpha reductase inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">International Prostate Symptom Score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is a reproducible, validated index designed to determine disease severity and response to therapy. By itself, it is not a reliable diagnostic tool for LUTS suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but serves as a quantitative measure of LUTS after the diagnosis is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The IPSS, similar to the AUA's Symptom Score (AUASS), consists of seven questions related to voiding symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57680 \">table 1</a>). Scores of 0 to 7, 8 to 19, and 20 to 35 signify mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, respectively.</p><p>In addition, the IPSS includes a quality of life score as a single 7-point scale question asking the patient how he would feel if he were to spend the rest of his life with his current urinary condition. Similarly, the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire - Male LUTS (ICIQ-MLUTS) asks patients to rate, on a scale of 0 to 10, how much leaking urine interferes with everyday life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for specialist referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is reasonable to initiate a trial of therapy for BPH when the primary care clinician is comfortable that presenting signs and symptoms are consistent with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) due to BPH as the probable source of LUTS.</p><p>Men who predominantly have storage symptoms, suggesting overactive bladder (OAB), should be evaluated for PVR before anticholinergic medication is initiated. A referral to urology should be considered if the PVR cannot be determined in the primary care setting or if the patient has not responded to a trial of medication for BPH.</p><p>Referral to a urological specialist may also be appropriate for patients with LUTS and any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men &lt;45 years old</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormality on prostate examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of hematuria in the absence of infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to respond to initial treatment for LUTS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men who desire surgical treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men with incontinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men with severe symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PVRs &gt;300 to 400 mL that are increasing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some controversy regarding the role of diagnostic studies in the evaluation of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) who are referred to a urologist. Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) advise that all testing (including uroflowmetry, postvoid residual [PVR], pressure-flow urodynamics, and cystoscopy) be considered optional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The 6<sup>th</sup> International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Diseases recommends urine flow rate measurement (Qmax) and PVR, measured by ultrasonography, prior to initiating active treatment and for subsequent monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pressure-flow studies are recommended for the evaluation of patients before invasive therapies (when Qmax is greater than 10 mL per second) or when a precise diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is important. Both panels suggest cystoscopy and imaging of the prostate and upper tracts when indicated for evaluation of possible renal or malignant disease (eg, recurrent urinary infection, hematuria, renal insufficiency).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive studies for LUTS include uroflowmetry to measure Qmax, bladder scan or ultrasound to determine PVR, or transabdominal ultrasound to assess bladder anatomy for evidence of outlet obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Uroflowmetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uroflowmetry is a simple non-invasive urodynamic measurement in which a patient urinates into a device that measures the <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/time</span> of urine accumulation. Combined with a measurement of PVR (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Postvoid residual'</a> below), it is an excellent screening tool for BOO in men with LUTS but does not provide information regarding the presence of overactive bladder (OAB). Additionally, a diagnosis of BOO cannot be made or excluded based on uroflowmetry alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Uroflowmetry measures voided volume, voiding time, average flow rate, and Qmax. It also provides a linear analysis of the flow <span class=\"nowrap\">rate/voiding</span> time so that the voiding pattern can be evaluated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79658\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79658 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Qmax is the single best measurement obtained by this study to assess voiding dysfunction. However, a low Qmax does not distinguish between BOO and decreased detrusor contractility, and a normal Qmax does not exclude BOO. Qmax may be normal in the early stages of obstruction due to compensatory increase in detrusor contractility resulting in high voiding pressures.</p><p>Approximately 85 to 90 percent of men with a Qmax less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/s</span> are found to be obstructed on pressure-flow studies. BOO can be accurately diagnosed in men with a Qmax of less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/s</span> and an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In addition to Qmax, the flow pattern should be noted; characteristic patterns may have diagnostic relevance. Obstruction generally demonstrates a flattened flow pattern with a low Qmax, a prolonged flow time, and a slow time to maximum flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58694\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58694 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Postvoid residual</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most urologists perform a PVR as part of their assessment, PVR does not correlate with the severity of LUTS, the presence of BOO, or treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. An elevated PVR is found with obstruction but may also indicate detrusor decompensation due to various causes, including chronic BOO.

As an example, a man with a low Qmax and a high PVR may have either BOO or detrusor decompensation. Urodynamic studies could determine if the etiology of the elevated PVR were due to BOO, requiring treatment with alpha-blockers or surgery, or to detrusor compensation which might require catheter drainage or close surveillance.</p><p>For men with an elevated PVR without obstruction, we typically check the PVR once per year.

Urodynamics are important in the evaluation of male patients with neurologic disease and in patients who fail treatment for BOO. Urodynamics are often performed before empiric treatment, when a non-BOO etiology is suspected, or when invasive treatment is contemplated. Additionally, men under age 50 should be evaluated with urodynamic studies prior to treatment due to the high incidence of non-obstructive etiology for LUTS in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The urodynamic evaluation involves the concurrent multichannel measurement of bladder and abdominal pressures during the <span class=\"nowrap\">filling/storage</span> and voiding phase of micturition. Detrusor pressure is calculated as the difference between the bladder and abdominal pressures. Urodynamics are the best method to diagnose high-pressure, low-flow voiding that is typical of BOO and differentiate it from low or normal pressure low-flow voiding due to detrusor decompensation.</p><p>Several parameters are measured to assess the relationship between flow and pressure during micturition. These include the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram and the more commonly used BOO index (BOOI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The BOOI relates the detrusor pressure at maximum flow (Pdet) to Qmax; an elevated BOOI indicates obstruction.</p><p>The cystometrogram provides information regarding bladder storage capacity, bladder sensation, the presence or absence of detrusor overactivity, and bladder compliance (the ability of the bladder to expand and accommodate increasing volumes of urine). The role of the cystometrogram to evaluate the bladder as a source of male LUTS is often overlooked because of a focus on the prostate as the sole cause of symptoms.</p><p>Storage LUTS symptoms in men may result from detrusor overactivity, obstruction, or other bladder abnormalities. The cystometrogram may demonstrate a normal pattern or some combination of the following abnormalities during filling: reduced maximum cystometric capacity (&lt;150 mL), involuntary detrusor contractions (&gt;10 cm H<sub>2</sub>0), or loss of bladder compliance.

Lifestyle changes include avoiding fluids prior to bedtime or before going out and reducing consumption of mild diuretics such as caffeine and alcohol. Training in biofeedback to promote pelvic relaxation may be particularly helpful for patients with urgency symptoms. A randomized trial found that men with LUTS who were given an intervention that included education, lifestyle advice, and problem solving skills were significantly less likely to experience treatment failure (increase in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) or requirement for medication) compared with the control group (watchful waiting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Initial treatment for BOO secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is generally pharmacologic, especially in patients with mild to moderate symptoms and no clear indication for surgical intervention.

BOO reduction surgery results in resolution of detrusor overactivity in one-half of men with detrusor overactivity preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Importantly, relieving the obstruction may prevent worsening of OAB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Men with detrusor overactivity and BOO may have postoperative urinary urgency and urgency incontinence. Unlike postoperative stress urinary incontinence (resulting from injury to the continence mechanism during resection), this urgency may be due to longstanding benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urinary tract infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postoperative irritability of the prostatic fossa. Symptoms may continue until the urinary tract infection is treated or the prostatic fossa heals. In most cases, conservative treatment is recommended. Urodynamics can be helpful for persistent urge symptoms to distinguish detrusor overactivity from other causes of irritative symptoms. Anticholinergic medication, combined with antiinflammatory therapy, usually provide effective treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">BOO with high PVR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with OAB who have evidence of BOO and elevated PVR should initially be treated for relief of their obstruction by either medical or surgical therapy. This group is at high risk of urinary retention with anticholinergic therapy, and therapy for OAB symptoms should be delayed until obstruction is relieved.</p><p>If symptoms persist after medical treatment or surgery, patients should be reevaluated with urodynamic studies, including the determination of PVR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A subset of these patients will have OAB with detrusor decompensation. It is important to closely monitor those patients as they are at the highest risk of developing urinary retention with anticholinergic treatment. Less than 5 percent of men will have worsening BOO without being symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, the PVR should be checked at periodic assessment (generally, every 6 to 12 months) for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory OAB</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Sacral neuromodulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with OAB symptoms refractory to medical therapy may be candidates for sacral neuromodulation (SNM). The exact mechanism of action is uncertain. Most clinical studies of these devices have focused on women with urgency urinary incontinence; the common innervation of the bladder makes it likely that clinical outcomes would be similar for men. SNM and its risks and benefits are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women#H4009993299\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urgency incontinence/overactive bladder in women&quot;, section on 'Procedural and other therapies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Botulinum toxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulinum toxin causes muscle relaxation through inhibition of acetylcholine release. Cystoscopic injection of botulinum toxin directly into the detrusor muscle results in chemical denervation that is reversible after six to nine months. Type A serotype is used in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Botulinum toxin A can be used for neurogenic causes of detrusor overactivity (eg, spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis). It has also been used in patients with non-neurogenic OAB but is typically reserved for patients with symptoms refractory to anticholinergic agents.</p><p>Limited data on intravesical botulinum suggest benefit but are somewhat mixed, and there are no robust data regarding safety or optimal dose. A 2007 systematic review of randomized trials of botulinum, compared with no treatment, nonpharmacologic treatment, and pharmacologic treatment for OAB, found few well-controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Eight small trials, including patients of mixed gender with predominantly neurogenic OAB, demonstrated superiority of botulinum to placebo in episodes of incontinence, bladder capacity, and quality of life. However, in a retrospective study of 88 men who initiated botulinum toxin A for OAB and were followed for almost six years, nearly 75 percent discontinued treatment, mostly due to lack of sufficient effect or to side effects including urinary retention, need to self-catheterize, or voiding LUTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2988880929\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H376939113\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LUTS in men have most often been attributed to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) resulting from benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Voiding symptoms are suggestive of BOO but are not diagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Bladder outlet obstruction from BPH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overactive bladder (OAB) is related to detrusor overactivity and is most commonly associated with storage symptoms that are frequently more bothersome than voiding symptoms. The cause of OAB is often unknown. OAB may be neurogenic (eg, secondary to stroke or other neurologic condition) or may be caused by chronic obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male patients with LUTS should be evaluated initially with history, physical examination, and laboratory studies, which may include creatinine, glucose, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urinalysis, and urine culture. Determining the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) can be helpful in monitoring treatment response. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Initial patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with significant symptoms and findings consistent with BPH and BOO as cause for LUTS may be treated empirically. We suggest urological referral for men who are less than 45 years old or who do not respond to empiric therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Indications for specialist referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role for urological studies in evaluating LUTS is controversial. Postvoid residual does not correlate with LUTS severity or provide diagnostic information regarding BOO or OAB. However, awareness of an elevated postvoid residual (PVR) may guide treatment with anticholinergic medication as well as the need for closer follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical treatment for BPH and BOO includes alpha blockers, phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or a combination. Surgical treatment is usually reserved for medication failure, progressive symptoms, or patient preference. Relief of obstruction may not relieve symptoms related to OAB, and urodynamic studies may be helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transurethral procedures for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical options for BPH include minimally invasive surgical therapies (microwave therapy, transurethral radiofrequency ablation), laser vaporization of prostate, transurethral resection of prostate, and open prostatectomy.

Anticholinergic medications are used for OAB treatment but can cause orthostasis, dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention. Side effects may be minimized by using a low dose of medication, long-acting preparations, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolterodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolterodine</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'BOO with low PVR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that men who have a significantly elevated PVR not be treated with an anticholinergic medication until obstruction is relieved, either medically or surgically (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).
