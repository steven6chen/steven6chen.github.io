In 1988, a study from Canada described a severe infantile leukodystrophy in three Cree Indian villages termed &quot;Cree leukoencephalopathy&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], a condition that is now recognized as a phenotypic variant of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> was not recognized as a clinical syndrome until the 1990s.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disease was first recognized in 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A detailed 1994 report from the United States described four unrelated patients with progressive ataxic diplegia and characteristic MRI features that was named &quot;childhood ataxia with diffuse central nervous system hypomyelination&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1993 study from Germany identified similar features in three children with normal early development who rapidly declined with progressive ataxia and spasticity, followed later by bulbar symptoms, optic atrophy, and seizures; brain MRI showed a diffuse hypodensity of the white matter similar to the signal of the ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1997, a study from the Netherlands described a cohort of nine children, including three affected sibling pairs, who had similar clinical, radiographic, and pathologic characteristics and were diagnosed with a &quot;new leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>This review will use the term &quot;childhood ataxia with central nervous system <span class=\"nowrap\">hypomyelination/vanishing</span> white matter disease&quot; <span class=\"nowrap\">(CACH/VWM)</span> for this condition. Later studies have revealed the genetic underpinnings and the phenotypic variability of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM,</span> as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inheritance of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> is autosomal recessive. Mutations in any of the five genes that encode subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B are the cause of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> and its phenotypic variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>].</p><p>The eIF2B protein complex is composed of five different subunits (eIF2Balpha, eIF2Bbeta, eIF2Bgamma, eIF2Bdelta, and eIF2Bepsilon). The genes corresponding to these subunits are named EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5 and are located on chromosomes 12q24.3, 14q24, 1p34.1, 2p23.3, and 3q27, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eukaryotic initiation factors are involved in the translation of mRNA to polypeptides. A general discussion of translation is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The eIF2B protein complex plays a critical role in the initiation of protein synthesis and the cellular response to stress by activating the initiation factor eIF2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. In this role, eIF2B catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), which is bound to inactive eIF2, for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Activated eIF2-GTP delivers the initiator methionyl-transfer RNA (Met-tRNA) to the small ribosomal subunits. Upon recognition of the start codon of the RNA, the GTP bound to eIF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP, which renders eIF2 inactive. To begin another round of protein synthesis, eIF2B must reactivate eIF2 by exchanging GDP for GTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>During periods of stress, the cytoplasmic kinase domain of eIF2B phosphorylates eIF2 and limits further translation of ER-destined proteins. Down-regulation of eIF2B activity by eIF2 kinases enables two responses: a general reduction in the translation of most mRNAs, and a simultaneous enhancement of translation of stress-responsive mRNAs encoding rescue proteins. Counterintuitively, the translation of certain mRNAs is enhanced under conditions of reduced levels of <span class=\"nowrap\">eIF2-GTP/Met-tRNAi(Met)</span> ternary complexes. This regulatory mechanism is mediated by regulatory short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within their 5'-untranslated region, upstream of the major coding region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This process leads to synthesis of rescue proteins that promote cell survival during stress. The cellular stress response can be triggered by various conditions, such as trauma, heat, and infection. Cellular stress causes the misfolding of proteins, which can lead to apoptosis of the cell by activating the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, hyperthermia causes protein denaturation, which can also activate the unfolded protein response and apoptosis.</p><p>Most of the mutations in any one of the five causative genes (EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5) are hypomorphic, causing partial loss-of-function of eIF2B guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Some mutations, including some associated with severe disease, have little or no decreased in eIF2B activity and some actually cause an increase in GEF activity. It is likely that the decreased activity of eIF2B disrupts the cellular response to stress and causes inappropriate activation of the unfolded protein response, which would explain the association of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM-related</span> disease onset <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapid deterioration with stress, injury, or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/8,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21</a>]. Some mutations may lead to <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> by affecting eIF2B function in as yet unknown ways, which may not be related directly to its role as a translation initiation factor. In addition, glial cells appear to have a selective vulnerability to decreased eIF2B activity, which explains the predominant involvement of white matter in the brain as seen in <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise incidence and prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> is unknown, but it may be one of the more common leukodystrophies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among patients with a leukodystrophy of unknown etiology, one review stated that 40 percent met clinical criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and a report of 92 patients with leukoencephalopathy of unknown origin found radiographic features of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> by MRI in 21 (23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At the time of these studies, the genetic mutations now implicated in <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> were not completely defined.</p><p>In a study of 50 unaffected Cree adults, 1 in 10 adults were heterozygous for a G584A mutation on the EIF2B5 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], suggesting a high carrier rate in select populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical features of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> are progressive neurologic deterioration with prominent ataxia and spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Optic atrophy is rare and seizures can occur relatively late in the disease course. Intellectual functioning is usually relatively spared. Febrile illness, minor head trauma, or severe fright often leads to sudden neurologic deterioration, including coma, with incomplete recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/14,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25,26</a>].</p><p>There are now five clinical subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vanishing-white-matter-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antenatal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infantile</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early childhood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late <span class=\"nowrap\">childhood/juvenile</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult (over 15 years)</p><p/><p>Patients with an earlier age of onset have a more severe form of <span class=\"nowrap\">CACH/VWM</span> with more rapid decline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antenatal form presents in the third trimester with decreased fetal movements and oligohydramnios.
