These names, along with others, reflect its unpredictable and volatile effects. It was patented in the 1950s as a dissociative anesthetic agent called Sernyl, but was later withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects, including severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and prolonged periods of decreased consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The recreational use of PCP gained popularity during the 1960s due to its hallucinogenic effects and ease of synthesis. In April of 1979, all legal manufacturing of PCP in the United States was terminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the early 1970s, a laboratory investigation of PCP derivatives led to the discovery of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>. Ketamine is 5 to 10 percent as potent as phencyclidine and is now used clinically to induce dissociative anesthesia. Ketamine is also abused as a recreational drug.</p><p>Despite a fall in popularity since the 1970s, PCP remains a commonly abused drug that accounts for a significant number of poison center calls and hospitalizations. Early identification and prompt symptomatic treatment are vital to avoid possible sequelae, including self-injury, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Monitoring the Future study, which tracks reported illicit drug use among high-school students, the recreational use of PCP in the prior year by United States high school seniors decreased from 7 percent in 1979 to 1.1 percent in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, almost 100,000 children between 11 and 21 years of age in the United States report having used PCP at least once in the prior year, and approximately 1500 annual emergency department (ED) visits for PCP intoxication occur in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Between 2005 through 2011, ED visits for PCP intoxication among those age 12 to 17 years has increased 184 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Deaths due to PCP intoxication are uncommon; most fatalities are due to traumatic injury rather than direct drug effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>PCP intoxication in children under six years of age is rare and typically occurs as an inadvertent oral or inhalational exposure due to caregiver drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCP, or 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl) piperidine hydrochloride, is an arylcyclohexylamine dissociative anesthetic with structural and pharmacologic properties similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>. It is synthesized from piperidine and cyclohexanone and is manufactured illegally in underground laboratories and distributed in varying dosage forms, strengths, and purities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Drug users may be exposed inadvertently to PCP because it is used as an additive in LSD, marijuana, and methamphetamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, PCP is longer acting and more likely to cause seizures, confusion, and delirium. Synthetic derivatives of both PCP and ketamine, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dextromethorphan</a> are used as recreational drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-poisoning#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ketamine poisoning&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p>PCP is available in white powder (&quot;angel dust&quot;), tablet (&quot;Peace Pill&quot;), crystal, and liquid (&quot;whack&quot;) forms that can be ingested, inhaled, injected, or smoked. Young children can be exposed to PCP through secondhand smoke inhalation, ingesting PCP-impregnated cigarette butts, or through inadvertent dermal exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12-14</a>]. Adolescent use and pharmacologic effects are similar to adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Pharmacology and cellular toxicology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Kinetics'</a>.)</p><p>PCP has three primary sites of action in the CNS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex &ndash; PCP has great affinity for NMDA receptor complexes in the hippocampus, neocortex, basal ganglia, and limbic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. NMDA antagonism at these sites produces acute psychosis that mimics schizophrenia in humans and leads to excess excitatory neurotransmitters (eg, glutamate, glycine, aspartate) that can cause agitation and seizures. Animal studies also suggest that the developing brain is at greater risk for injury and cell death from excessive levels of these excitatory neurotransmitters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neuronal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">norepinephrine</a>, and serotonin reuptake complex &ndash; PCP inhibits reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Kinetics'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCP intoxication is a diagnosis that must be suspected clinically. PCP intoxication should be suspected in children with nystagmus, blank staring, strange behavior, altered mental status, agitation, choreoathetosis, seizures, acute psychosis, or a combination of these symptoms. Duration of action is generally brief (four to eight hours). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2410268\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history of unexpected exposure or overdose in young children under six years of age is rarely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Caregivers typically note an abrupt onset of altered behavior consistent with neurobehavioral effects of PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. </p><p>Older children and adolescents usually are exposed to PCP through recreational use, although passive or inadvertent exposure (eg, being unaware of PCP in a marijuana cigarette) may also occur. In many instances, the patient is unable to provide a history. Sometimes friends or emergency medical services personnel may provide useful details. It can be helpful to know the street names for PCP, which include angel dust, embalming fluid, fry, wets, killer weed, peace pill, horse tranquilizer, and hog (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78468 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2411938\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCP intoxication produces a wide range of vital sign and neuropsychiatric findings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412093\"><span class=\"h3\">General findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination should begin with an assessment of the patient's airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status. Respiratory depression occurs more commonly in children with PCP intoxication than in adults. Apnea may immediately precede or follow generalized seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. These episodes usually are brief and self-limited, but some patients require mechanical ventilation. Patients may also exhibit irregular breathing, with alternating episodes of apnea and tachypnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412100\"><span class=\"h3\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tachycardia and hypertension (both systolic and diastolic) are frequently seen. Hypertension is present in 30 percent of infants with PCP intoxication, but is usually transient and asymptomatic. However, subarachnoid hemorrhage has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Severe neuromuscular excitability can result in hyperthermia while environmental exposure may cause hypothermia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412164\"><span class=\"h3\">Eye findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Horizontal, vertical, or rotatory nystagmus is found in the majority of children and adolescents with PCP intoxication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74834 \">table 2</a>). A stuporous blank stare is also often seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. Classically, PCP has been listed as a cause of miosis. However, dilated pupils may also be seen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412295\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuropsychiatric findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and young children who are exposed to PCP may present with seizures, irritability, lethargy, coma, fluctuations in level of consciousness, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. In one review of PCP intoxication in 28 children younger than five years of age, choreoathetosis was present in more than 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Opisthotonos and hyperreflexia are less commonly seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,18</a>].</p><p>Older children and adolescents may also present with lethargy, coma, agitation, seizures, and ataxia. However, a significant number may be alert with bizarre behavior. </p><p>Psychomotor agitation is commonly seen in older children and adolescents with PCP intoxication. Similar to adults, these patients may demonstrate violent and unpredictable behavior that is exacerbated by decreased pain perception, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and delusions of super-human strength. Patients require a cautious approach during initial treatment to ensure staff safety while addressing the child&rsquo;s medical needs.

Hypersalivation is also frequently seen. </p><p>Injuries occur commonly in patients with PCP intoxication because the drug produces a dissociative state with violent and unpredictable behavior. The evaluation of patients with suspected trauma is complicated by the anesthetic effects of PCP, which can mask serious injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412543\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatalities in the setting of PCP intoxication are uncommon and most are secondary to trauma. Other causes include hyperthermia, respiratory arrest, rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia, and intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p>Treating clinicians should be aware of the potential for multiple serious complications in children with PCP intoxication.

Capillary glucose and pulse oximetry should be determined in patients presenting with altered mental status. A rectal temperature is imperative in agitated or seizing patients to assess for the presence of hyperthermia (rectal temperature &gt;38.5&deg;C [101&deg;F]). Respiratory depression and apnea may occur abruptly in infants and young children necessitating rapid sequence intubation (RSI). We suggest avoiding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a> when performing RSI in patients with known or suspected PCP intoxication who exhibit significant psychomotor agitation or hyperthermia because of the risk of exacerbating rhabdomyolysis-related hyperkalemia. Further acute interventions are based upon clinical findings, as quantitative testing for PCP is generally unavailable and unhelpful. (See <a href=\"#H6404407\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Tachycardia is common, but rarely requires specific treatment in children and adolescents. </p><p>Agitated patients warrant careful evaluation for traumatic injuries once adequate sedation is achieved. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6404377\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid control of psychomotor agitation is the cornerstone of successful management.

Thereafter, chemical sedation is essential to control agitation, prevent or treat hyperthermia, perform a thorough physical examination, and obtain necessary studies.</p><p>Little evidence exists to guide the use of sedatives in the management of PCP intoxication. Based upon observational reports and broad clinical experience, we believe benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose: 4 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose: 10 mg) are the preferred agents for the initial treatment of PCP-induced agitation.

The emergency provider should exclude life-threatening hypoglycemia and hypoxia as contributing factors to agitation as soon as is safely possible. We treat severely agitated patients immediately with intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose: 4 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose 10 mg). These doses can be repeated every eight to ten minutes based upon patient response. Although IV administration is preferred, intramuscular administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum single dose: 10 mg) may be given in patients in whom intravenous access cannot be rapidly achieved. </p><p>Butyrophenones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">droperidol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">haloperidol</a>) are used as adjunctive therapy in adults with PCP intoxication when benzodiazepines do not adequately control symptoms and in adults with violent behavior due to other causes.

However, there are no high quality studies in adolescents to support such claims. Furthermore, haloperidol may treat underlying psychotic symptoms that may, in part, be the source of agitation. Patients who receive haloperidol warrant a 12-lead EKG and cardiac monitoring.

Recovery from psychosis can take weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Prolonged psychosis occurs more commonly in chronic abusers and is a poor prognostic sign. Withdrawal symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, anergia, and disturbances of thought and sleep, have been described in chronic users after as little as one day of abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Chronic abusers may benefit from behavioral treatment for substance abuse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106227300\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care.

PCP exposure is rare in young infants and children and typically represents an inadvertent oral or inhalational exposure due to caregiver drug use. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCP intoxication produces a wide range of vital sign and neuropsychiatric findings. In infants and young children altered mental status (eg, lethargy, irritability), nystagmus, choreoathetosis, seizures, ataxia, and blank staring are common features. Abrupt respiratory depression with apnea may occur. In adolescents, nystagmus, psychomotor agitation, hallucinations, and violent behavior are prevalent. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of overdose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical picture of PCP intoxication shares features common to many other intoxications and medical conditions, especially those that cause acute psychosis. The differential diagnosis and approach to acute psychosis in the emergency department is provided in the tables and algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52785 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50275\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50275 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56663\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56663 \">algorithm 1</a>) and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency department evaluation of acute onset psychosis in children&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-department-evaluation-of-acute-onset-psychosis-in-children#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency department evaluation of acute onset psychosis in children&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative drug levels have little role in the management of acute toxicity of known recreational drug users. Qualitative urine testing is appropriate when distinguishing acute psychosis due to drug toxicity from other types of psychosis and in situations where child abuse is suspected. Results may remain positive for weeks. Thus, a positive urine test may <strong>not</strong> indicate acute intoxication. (See <a href=\"#H6403279\" class=\"local\">'Testing for PCP'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in adults&quot;, section on 'Testing for PCP'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of PCP intoxication is primarily supportive. In addition to careful assessment and support of airway, breathing, and circulation, as needed, the clinician should anticipate and aggressively manage agitation, seizures, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, hypertension, and dystonic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H6403425\" class=\"local\">'General studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6404377\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6404407\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early management of agitation or violent behavior is essential to prevent patient and staff injury. Sedation should be administered as rapidly as possible. The emergency provider should exclude life-threatening hypoglycemia and hypoxia as contributing factors to agitation as soon as is safely possible. Our approach to sedation is as follows: &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Severe agitation</strong> &ndash; We suggest treating severely agitated children and adolescents immediately with intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose: 4 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose 10 mg) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These doses can be repeated every eight to ten minutes based upon patient response. Although IV administration is preferred, intramuscular administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> typical maximum single dose: 10 mg) may be given in patients in whom intravenous access cannot be rapidly achieved. (See <a href=\"#H6404384\" class=\"local\">'Severe agitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Severe agitation not responding to benzodiazepines</strong> &ndash; We suggest that adolescent patients, with severe agitation that threatens harm to themselves or others and is not controlled with parenteral benzodiazepines, receive parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">haloperidol</a> (initial dose 5 mg, IV or IM) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Adolescents whose agitation persists despite treatment with appropriate doses of benzodiazepines and haloperidol and whose agitation risks life-threatening complications (eg, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis) should undergo rapid sequence intubation and muscle relaxation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6404384\" class=\"local\">'Severe agitation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Severe intoxication with risk for hyperthermia or rhabdomyolysis</strong> &ndash; We suggest that infants and children under 12 years of age with severe PCP intoxication, that risks life-threatening complications (eg, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis), undergo rapid sequence intubation and muscle relaxation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456 \">table 5</a>)<strong> </strong>rather than receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">haloperidol</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6404384\" class=\"local\">'Severe agitation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Mild or moderate intoxication</strong> &ndash; We suggest that mildly or moderately PCP intoxicated patients receive benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose 2 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, typical maximum single dose: 5 mg) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Benzodiazepines may be repeated as needed (See <a href=\"#H6404392\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate agitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that children and adolescents with PCP intoxication <strong>NOT</strong> undergo gastric emptying (induced vomiting or gastric lavage) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that pediatric patients with PCP intoxication <strong>NOT</strong> receive continuous nasogastric suctioning (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that children and adolescents with isolated PCP intoxication <strong>NOT </strong>be given activated charcoal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with co-ingestants that bind to activated charcoal may benefit from its administration. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of phencyclidine exposure in an infant or young child should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, subspecialist physician), if available, and mandatory reporting, depending on the local legal requirements. Infants and young children with mild PCP intoxication need a full assessment of the social circumstances that allowed the exposure. Such an investigation often requires admission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-social-and-medicolegal-issues#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues&quot;, section on 'Mandatory reporting'</a> and <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients of any age with persistent symptoms should be admitted to a monitored setting. Due to the relatively short duration of action, older children and adolescents with mild symptoms are candidates for a period of observation and discharge. Patients whose medical symptoms resolve but have persistent behavioral issues should receive psychiatric evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Pali MJ, Tharratt RS, Albertson TE.
