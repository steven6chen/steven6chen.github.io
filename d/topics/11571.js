Primary rectal squamous cell carcinomas, which are very rare, can be difficult to distinguish from anal cancers and are treated according to the same approach as anal cancer, with initial chemoradiotherapy rather than surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer#H523512861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, staging, and treatment of anal cancer&quot;, section on 'Rectal squamous cell cancers'</a>.)</p><p>Superficially invasive, small rectal adenocarcinomas may be effectively managed with limited surgical procedures, such as local excision. However, the majority of patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require more extensive surgery, such as low anterior or abdominoperineal resection. Others present with locally advanced tumors that are adherent or fixed to adjoining structures, such as the sacrum, pelvic sidewalls, prostate, or bladder. The surgical and oncologic management of these patients varies greatly depending upon stage and location within the rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Although the resulting anorectal function may be imperfect, the risk of postoperative sexual and urinary dysfunction may be diminished by preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves. This is possible in most cases, particularly with the use of total mesorectal excision (TME) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65765 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The avoidance of a permanent colostomy is a major benefit.

Abdominoperineal resection (APR) has long been considered to be the standard operation for lower tumors with a distal edge up to 6 cm from the anal verge. However, despite providing excellent local control and survival, APR entails a permanent colostomy and a high incidence of sexual and urinary dysfunction.

The only definitive indication for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, supported by the results of randomized trials, is the presence of a T3 or T4 tumor. However, relative indications for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy include the presence of clinically node-positive disease in a patient with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-staged <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> rectal cancer, a distal rectal tumor for which an abdominoperineal resection (APR) is thought to be necessary, and a tumor that appears to invade the mesorectal fascia on preoperative imaging because of the decreased likelihood of achieving a tumor-free circumferential resection margin (CRM) with upfront surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">T3/4 tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only definitive indication for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, supported by the results of randomized trials, is the presence of T3 or T4 rectal adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>). These are patients who, if resected initially, would likely require postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Data from randomized trials and a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] suggest that the preoperative approach is associated with a more favorable long-term toxicity profile and fewer local recurrences than postoperative therapy; overall survival appears to be similar. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Versus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629501194\"><span class=\"h3\">cT3N0 tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal management of clinical T3N0 rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N0 based upon preoperative EUS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI) is unclear. Some of these patients have a sufficiently favorable prognosis that questions have been raised as to the necessity of postoperative adjuvant therapy after upfront total mesorectal excision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Favorable risk tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Others have questioned the utility of upfront chemoradiotherapy for patients with cT3N0 tumors, particularly those involving the upper rectum, given the favorable low rates of local recurrence after total mesorectal excision (TME) alone in the Dutch TME trial and retrospective analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant short-course RT'</a> below.)</p><p>On the other hand, as many as one-fifth of these patients may be understaged by preoperative imaging. In a review of 188 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">EUS/MRI-staged</span> T3N0 tumors who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy, 41 (22 percent) were found to have pathologically positive mesorectal lymph nodes at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Given the downstaging effect of chemoradiotherapy, it is likely that an even larger number of these patients would have been found to have node-positive disease (and recommended for postoperative adjuvant therapy) had surgery been undertaken initially.</p><p>Thus, given the limitations of current imaging, all patients with cT3N0 rectal adenocarcinoma by EUS or MRI could be considered appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.</p><p>Issues related to locoregional staging in patients with newly diagnosed rectal cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1109524\"><span class=\"h3\">Contribution of depth of extramural penetration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have shown that T3 tumors with &gt;5 mm of extramural invasion have a higher rate of nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and lower cancer-specific survival (54 versus 85 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]) compared with tumors with a depth of penetration of 5 mm or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These findings have led some to suggest that it is not necessarily the distinction between T2 and T3 tumors that may potentially govern treatment decisions, but the identification of high-risk T3 tumors with a &gt;5 mm depth of extramural tumor invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In fact, updated guidelines for treatment of rectal cancer from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggest that patients with a depth of invasion beyond the muscularis propria that is 5 mm or less are appropriate candidates for upfront surgery rather than neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, even if they are node positive, as long as the levators are not threatened, the mesorectal fascia is clear, and there is no extranodal extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>While preoperative, high-resolution MRI can identify those patients with T3 tumors and &lt;5 mm of extramural tumor invasion, who may have a good outcome with surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], T3 stage subclassification using the depth of extramural penetration is not incorporated into tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>), and it is not yet validated as a prognostic factor in rectal cancer. The approach of selecting patients with T3 rectal tumors for preoperative therapy based upon the depth of extramural tumor invasion is not yet standard, at least in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'MRI scan'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-quality evidence to support a clear benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as compared with initial surgery for other subgroups of patients with rectal cancer is lacking. Nevertheless, appropriate indications for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy include the presence of clinically node-positive involvement in a patient with an MRI or EUS-staged <span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> rectal adenocarcinoma, a distal rectal tumor for which an APR is thought to be necessary, and a tumor that appears to invade or &quot;threaten&quot; the mesorectal fascia on preoperative imaging because of the decreased likelihood of achieving a tumor-free CRM with upfront surgery.</p><p>The decision to pursue initial chemoradiotherapy should be considered carefully. In many of these situations, postoperative therapy (RT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy) may not be indicated based upon the final pathology report if the patient were to undergo initial surgery. The decision to use neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy commits the treating team to a four month course of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. This is because of the significant downstaging that often occurs with chemoradiotherapy. Patients who are found to have negative nodes following chemoradiation may have been positive at presentation, and the presence of positive nodes is a marker for an increased risk of systemic recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">T1/2 and clinically node-positive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have T1 or T2 tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>) and a suspicion of node-positive disease by MRI or EUS, the determination of &quot;node positivity&quot; can be particularly difficult. Most lymph nodes involved by rectal adenocarcinoma are less than 1 cm, but not all lymph nodes seen by MRI or EUS represent metastatic disease. MRI can assist in the determination of whether small visualized nodes are likely to be malignant by detecting mixed intranodal signal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irregularity of the border. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer#H6103151\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Assessing T and N stage, and the status of the CRM'</a>.)</p><p>Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy might be considered an appropriate option for these patients if they had involved lymph nodes. Thus, careful consideration for ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the lymph nodes should be given to any patient who has a clinical T1 or T2 tumor and questionable perirectal lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Distal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with distal rectal adenocarcinomas, a major goal of preoperative therapy is to convert the surgical procedure from an APR to a sphincter-preserving operation, such as a low anterior resection (LAR) with coloanal anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Whether or not an APR is required is somewhat subjective, and this makes determining this particular benefit of neoadjuvant therapy difficult to quantify, at least in terms of sphincter preservation. Sphincter preservation rates are highly dependent on the skill and experience of the surgeon, factors that are difficult to document.</p><p>The most common method to determine if preoperative therapy has increased the rate of sphincter preservation is through clinical assessment, in which the operating surgeon examines the patient prior to the start of therapy and declares the type of operation required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In the population under study, this rate is then compared with the actual operation that was carried out.</p><p>Unfortunately, few reported series provide results in patients who underwent such prospective assessment by their surgeon and were declared to need an APR before the start of preoperative therapy. The incidence of sphincter preservation in such reports ranges from 39 to 94 percent, averaging 67 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63971\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63971 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/23-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-31</a>]. Analyses of local control, survival, and bowel function are encouraging.</p><p>However, high-quality definitive evidence is lacking that preoperative chemoradiotherapy can consistently convert patients who need an APR to where an LAR is feasible. The German trial of preoperative versus postoperative chemoradiotherapy demonstrated that patients undergoing preoperative chemoradiotherapy were twice as likely to undergo a sphincter-sparing operation (39 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the absolute rates of APR in the two cohorts were not significantly different. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'German Rectal Cancer Study'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesorectal fascia involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may also be considered if the preoperative staging evaluation suggests that the tumor invades or &quot;threatens&quot; (ie, is within 1 to 2 mm of) the mesorectal fascia, which is the CRM when TME is performed. Data from several trials indicate that this finding is highly predictive of residual tumor at the CRM, which places the patient at a high risk of local recurrence and inferior survival. For anterior tumors, the status of the CRM can be predicted by either EUS or MRI, while for posterior or posterolateral tumors, MRI is the preferred strategy. (See <a href=\"#H6013599\" class=\"local\">'Locoregional staging: EUS versus MRI'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although there are fewer data to validate this approach, these patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative chemoradiotherapy in an attempt to downstage the tumor and permit a CRM-negative resection. One of the main benefits for preoperative, as compared with postoperative, chemoradiotherapy in the German Rectal Cancer Study discussed below (which did not focus on patients with evidence of mesorectal fascia involvement) was a reduction in the rate of local recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Versus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is vitally important that patients with newly diagnosed rectal cancer be accurately staged prior to treatment. Staging of distant disease extent as well as locoregional staging modalities are discussed in detail elsewhere; the most important issues are summarized below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'History, physical examination, and endoscopy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate the liver, retroperitoneal nodes, and chest is indicated in all patients. Serum levels of the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) should be assayed prior to treatment. Elevated pretreatment CEA levels that do not normalize posttreatment imply the presence of persistent disease and the need for further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'CT scan'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H109741268\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Tumor markers'</a>.)</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) scans do not appear to add significant information to CT scans for routine preoperative staging of rectal cancer but may be useful in specific circumstances (eg, the evaluation of patients who are thought to be present or future candidates for resection of isolated hepatic liver metastases). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'PET scans'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6013599\"><span class=\"h2\">Locoregional staging: EUS versus MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of appropriate patients with rectal adenocarcinoma for initial radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy, rather than surgery, is heavily dependent on accurate preoperative locoregional staging, which is mainly accomplished through physical examination, endoscopy, and imaging evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-local-staging-evaluation-for-rectal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment local staging evaluation for rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'History, physical examination, and endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Either EUS or high-resolution MRI is an acceptable radiographic method to determine preoperative local tumor stage. Both are more accurate than axial CT scans for assessing the depth of tumor invasion, nodal involvement, and the status of the circumferential resection margin (CRM). The choice of either modality may depend on local expertise. However, if available, optimal thin section (high-resolution) MRI using a surface pelvic phased-array coil MRI is generally preferred when patients are being evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy approaches because of its greater utility in assessing the CRM. EUS is only able to assess the status of the CRM for anteriorly located tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer#H1067157171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Circumferential resection margin'</a>.)</p><p>In practice, the information obtained with EUS and MRI is often complementary, and at some institutions, both procedures are done preoperatively.

For most patients, we suggest conventional fractionation radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (ie, long-course chemoradiotherapy) rather than the short-course Swedish approach to RT alone. Outside of the United States, short-course RT has been adopted in many institutions as the standard preoperative approach for operable rectal cancer. Some institutions in the United States are now using short-course RT in selected patients, such as prior to surgery in the setting of metastatic disease, to minimize delays in initiation of systemic therapy.

It is generally <strong>not</strong> appropriate to treat rectal tumors with anteroposterior-posteroanterior (AP-PA) fields alone. With this field arrangement, the anterior structures receive a high dose; since these structures are not substantially at risk for local failure, the two-field technique results in increased treatment-related toxicity without significant improvement in local control. At our institutions, we generally treat patients with a four-field box technique using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), although a three-field with right and left lateral fields and a posterior field is also reasonable. The use of lateral fields permits sparing of a portion of the bladder and some anteriorly placed small bowel.</p><p>Patients are treated in the prone position. For those with disease limited to the submucosa and muscularis propria, pelvic irradiation to 45 Gy in 25 fractions by a four-field technique is given, followed by the first field reduction with lateral fields to 50.4 Gy and a second field reduction (if appropriate) with lateral fields to 54.0 Gy. Patients are treated at 1.8 Gy per day, five fractions per week. For the initial fields (45 Gy), the superior border should be 1.5 cm above the level of the sacral promontory, and the lower border of the field should be 4 to 5 cm below the defined tumor bed. Laterally, the PA-AP fields extend 1 to 1.5 cm beyond the true bony pelvis. To treat the entire presacral space with adequate margins and full dose, the lateral fields are designed so that the posterior border encompasses the entire sacrum with a 1 cm margin posterior to the sacrum. Anteriorly, the fields are designed to encompass the previous tumor bed, including the posterior wall of the vagina for females and a large portion of the prostate for males.</p><p>After 45 Gy, lateral fields with an approximately 3 cm margin around the marked tumor bed are typically used for three fractions to bring the dose to 50.4 Gy. This is followed by a further field reduction, with a 2 cm margin around the marked tumor bed to 54 Gy. A small bowel series must be performed to ensure that no small bowel is within these lateral boost fields.</p><p>Based upon patterns of failure in contemporary series analyzing patients who have undergone total mesorectal excision and sphincter conservation surgery, some authors have suggested modification in the clinical target volume (CTV) to reduce the amount of normal tissue in the treated field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1239642997\"><span class=\"h4\">Role of IMRT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intensity modulated RT (IMRT) is an advanced form of 3D-CRT that changes the intensity of radiation in different parts of a single radiation beam while the treatment is delivered. IMRT relies upon computer control capabilities to maximize the delivery of radiation to the planned treatment volume while minimizing radiation to normal tissue outside the target. Early data from retrospective series and phase II trials suggest good compliance, low rates of acute bowel toxicity, and high complete pathologic response rates after preoperative IMRT with concurrent fluoropyrimidine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/125-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">125-132</a>].</p><p>However, there are no randomized trials comparing IMRT with conventional 3D-CRT, and its routine use cannot yet be recommended.

Two randomized trials comparing this approach with long-course chemoradiotherapy have concluded that rates of local recurrence (at least for non-distal tumors), DFS, distal recurrence, overall survival, and severe late toxicity are not significantly different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3842169669\"><span class=\"h3\">Versus surgery alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three trials have compared this approach with surgery alone for rectal cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Swedish study randomly assigned 1168 patients to receive or not receive 25 Gy delivered in five fractions in one week followed by surgery versus surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/21,133\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,133</a>]. After five years, RT was associated with significant improvements in both local control (89 versus 73 percent) and overall survival (58 versus 48 percent). With long-term follow-up, the number of hospital admissions for gastrointestinal disorders (bowel obstruction, abdominal pain) was two- to fourfold higher in irradiated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit for this approach was also reported in a <span class=\"nowrap\">MRC/National</span> Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) trial in which 1350 patients with operable nonmetastatic stage I to III rectal cancer were randomly assigned to preoperative short-course RT (25 Gy in five fractions over one week) or no preoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. In the control group, selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy with concomitant infusional FU) was recommended only if the surgical specimen had positive circumferential margins (77 of the 676 patients in this group, of whom 53 received it). Both groups were offered postoperative chemotherapy if they had positive circumferential margins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At a median follow-up of four years, the local recurrence rate was significantly lower with preoperative RT (4.4 versus 11 percent), and for the 596 patients who underwent optimal surgery (with a mesorectal plane of dissection rather than intramesorectal or within the muscularis propria), it was 1 versus 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. Three-year DFS was significantly better in the group that received preoperative RT (78 versus 72 percent, respectively), but overall survival was similar (80 versus 79 percent). These differences in favor of preoperative short-course RT were noted in all tumor stages and for all tumor locations. A later analysis of self-reported quality of life noted that men who received preoperative RT had significantly greater sexual dysfunction at six months than did those treated with surgery alone and that the difference persisted for up to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The trial was criticized for including a large number of patients who are not usually considered candidates for RT (including 315 stage I tumors) and because surgery was achieved in the mesorectal plane in only approximately one-half of enrolled patients.

The pCR rate was significantly higher in the conventional chemoradiotherapy group (16 versus 1 percent), and there were fewer cases of radial margin positivity (4 versus 13 percent), but the rate of sphincter preservation in both groups was comparable (58 and 61 percent, respectively). Early radiation toxicity was higher in the chemoradiotherapy group (18 versus 3 percent), but rates of local recurrence (9 versus 14 percent), DFS (58 versus 56 percent), and severe late toxicity (10 versus 7 percent) were not significantly different.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial, the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 01.04 trial, randomly assigned 326 patients to short-course RT (5 x 5 Gy fractions) versus conventional standard fractionation chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy with concomitant infusional FU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Patients in the short-course arm also received six courses of postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy while those in the conventional fractionation chemoradiotherapy group received four courses. As with the prior trial, the pCR rate was significantly higher with long-course chemoradiotherapy (15 versus 1 percent), but there were no differences in rates of margin positivity or sphincter preservation. At a median follow-up of nearly six years, patients receiving long-course chemoradiotherapy had a 3 percent lower cumulative local recurrence rate at three years (4.4 versus 7.5 percent) and a 2 percent lower cumulative local recurrence rate at five years (5.7 versus 7.5 percent); neither difference was statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in rates of distant recurrences, relapse-free survival, overall survival, or late grade 3 or 4 toxicity. A subset analysis of the 79 patients with distal tumors revealed a cumulative incidence of local recurrence of 12.5 percent for short-course RT and 0 percent for long-course chemoradiotherapy.</p><p/><p>It was hoped that additional information (especially information about the optimal duration between the end of short-course RT and surgery) would be available from the Stockholm III trial, a noninferiority trial which directly compared short-course RT with immediate surgery, short-course RT with delayed (four to eight weeks) surgery, and long-course RT with delayed (four to eight weeks) surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. However, the trial took 15 years to accrue and was amended after one year to allow participating hospitals to accrue only to the two short-course RT arms, resulting in imbalances among the groups. Furthermore, there was no concurrent chemotherapy in the long-course RT arm, and very few patients in any of the arms received adjuvant chemotherapy (15, 13, and 19 percent of those in the short-course immediate surgery, short-course delayed surgery, and long-course RT arms, respectively). The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not reported. These deficiencies render the results from intent-to-treat analysis (no significant difference in the three approaches) uninterpretable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2092436435\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical T4 and/or large bulky tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-course RT is generally not pursued for patients with clinical T4 (cT4) or large bulky tumors. However, encouraging results were noted in a Polish trial comparing short-course RT followed by consolidation chemotherapy (three months of FOLFOX4) prior to surgery versus long-course chemoradiotherapy utilizing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> plus bolus FU and LV in 541 patients with clinical T4 or fixed clinical T3 tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. Preoperative toxicity rates were lower with the short-course treatment, while R0 resection rates (77 versus 71 percent) and complete pathologic response rates (16 versus 12 percent) were not significantly better. At a median follow-up of 35 months, three-year rates of overall survival favored the short-course treatment (73 versus 65 percent).</p><p>Although these results appear promising, the control arm in this study, oxaliplatin-containing chemoradiotherapy, is generally not considered a standard approach for long-course chemoradiotherapy due to greater treatment-related toxicity and no better outcomes when directly compared with standard fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H192757942\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin'</a> above.)</p><p>Alternative approaches to preoperative treatment intensification for this group are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1071237872\"><span class=\"h2\">Intensification of preoperative therapy for T4 and/or bulky tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with T4 or bulky tumors or those with extensive nodal disease, or if the treating team is worried that a positive margin at the time of surgery is a likely event, unless the patient experiences significant downstaging, we suggest induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy as an appropriate alternative to induction chemoradiotherapy alone. The rationale for this approach is to intensify the neoadjuvant therapy by the addition of chemotherapy to chemoradiotherapy, leading to higher rates of resectability and pathologic complete responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>], as well as addressing potential systemic disease early and more effectively compared with the postoperative administration of chemotherapy. However, the optimal regimen and long-term impact on outcomes remain undefined. If this approach is chosen, we suggest use of an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen rather than a fluoropyrimidine alone, and we limit induction chemotherapy to no more than four months. In these circumstances, we recommend that physicians proceed cautiously with scans after two months of therapy and move directly to chemoradiotherapy if no response is seen.</p><p>There has been increasing interest in the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy prior to surgical management of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/120,144-151\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,144-151</a>].

After neoadjuvant CAPOX, the radiologic response rate was 88 percent. In addition, 86 percent of patients had symptomatic responses in a median of 32 days (just after one cycle of CAPOX). Four patients died during neoadjuvant CAPOX (pulmonary embolism, ischemic heart disease, sudden death with history of chest pain, and neutropenic colitis). Of the 70 who were eligible for surgery, 67 went on to TME (three were inoperable at laparotomy), and all but one had an R0 resection. A pathologic complete response (pCR) was observed in 16 patients (24 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based upon clinically significant cardiotoxic events (nine events in 8 of the 77 patients), the protocol was amended to exclude patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac problems. In a later analysis of a combined 105 enrolled patients, radiologic response rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy were 74 percent (78 of 105) and 89 percent (93 of 105), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. Ninety-seven patients underwent surgery, of whom 95 underwent TME, and 93 had microscopically clear resection margins; 21 had a pCR (20 percent). Three-year relapse-free and overall survival were 68 and 83 percent, respectively. Following the protocol amendment for cardiovascular safety, only one further thromboembolic event was reported (fatal pulmonary embolism).

The evidence used to support this approach is mainly an extrapolation of the proven benefit of postoperative adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy that was the standard of care in the era before preoperative combined modality therapy. As an example, a Cochrane review of adjuvant chemotherapy in resectable rectal cancer concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU)-based chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91) and disease recurrence (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].

A major unresolved issue is accurate nonoperative identification of patients who are complete or near-complete pathologic responders.

Prospective studies are needed to demonstrate that long-term outcomes with local excision are comparable to those attained with conventional surgery in patients who achieve a cCR with preoperative chemoradiotherapy before this can be considered a standard approach.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Mesorectal fascia involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">T1/2</span> but clinically node-positive rectal cancer. Because of the difficulty in interpreting the status of the perirectal nodes on noninvasive imaging, we suggest a biopsy to confirm the presence of involved lymph nodes prior to embarking on neoadjuvant therapy in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'T1/2 and clinically node-positive'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In all of these settings, patients must understand that there is a possibility that postoperative chemoradiotherapy might not be needed based upon the final pathologic stage if surgery is performed initially. However, due to a downstaging effect, pathologic nodal staging is unreliable after chemoradiotherapy. Thus, if this approach is followed, a six-month course of postoperative chemotherapy is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Benefit of postoperative chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best regimen for neoadjuvant therapy has not been established. For most patients, we suggest conventional fractionation radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (ie, long-course chemoradiotherapy) rather than the short-course Swedish approach to RT alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Outside of the United States, short-course RT has been adopted in many institutions as the standard preoperative approach for operable rectal cancer. Some institutions in the United States are now using short-course RT in selected patients, such as those who are thought unlikely to tolerate full-course chemoradiotherapy, or prior to rectal surgery in the setting of metastatic disease to minimize delays in initiation of systemic therapy. However, at many institutions, long-course chemoradiotherapy is still considered the preferred approach for most patients. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant short-course RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients undergoing long-course chemoradiotherapy, the best chemoradiotherapy regimen is unsettled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest continuous infusion <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU; 225 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/24</span> hours) during the entire course of RT, as has been used in the postoperative setting for rectal cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Combined modality therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (825 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> twice daily, five days per week) is an appropriate alternative. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Choice of chemotherapy regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> as a component of neoadjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy in early rectal cancer remains unclear. Nevertheless, given that toxicity is clearly worse compared with chemoradiotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine alone and that efficacy is not yet proven, we suggest not adding oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy outside of the context of a clinical trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H192757942\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with T4 or bulky tumors or those with extensive nodal disease, we suggest induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (or chemoradiotherapy followed by induction chemotherapy) as an appropriate alternative to induction chemoradiotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In these circumstances, we recommend that physicians proceed cautiously with scans after two months of therapy and move directly to chemoradiotherapy if no response is seen. If this approach is chosen, we suggest use of an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen rather than a fluoropyrimidine alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We would not administer more than four months of preoperative FOLFOX. (See <a href=\"#H1071237872\" class=\"local\">'Intensification of preoperative therapy for T4 and/or bulky tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection remains the standard approach after neoadjuvant therapy for patients who are reasonable surgical candidates, even if they appear to have a complete clinical response (cCR) to induction therapy. While promising, prospective validation is needed before either avoidance of radical surgery or local excision alone can be adopted for any subset of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of radical surgery for complete responders to preoperative treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the optimal timing is not conclusively established, we suggest surgical resection within 7 to 10 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H525183260\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the benefits are controversial, following resection, we suggest that all patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy receive four months of adjuvant chemotherapy, regardless of the pathologic findings (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, practice is variable, and at some institutions, patients with a pathologic complete response after induction therapy are not routinely offered postoperative chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Benefit of postoperative chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who received four months of initial chemotherapy prior to chemoradiotherapy, we omit adjuvant chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H1071237872\" class=\"local\">'Intensification of preoperative therapy for T4 and/or bulky tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The best regimen in this situation is not established. Reasonable options include short-term infusional FU plus LV and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (FOLFOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64504 \">table 7</a>)), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> plus oxaliplatin (XELOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61781 \">table 11</a>)), weekly bolus FU plus high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (LV; each 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly for six of every eight weeks), short-term infusional FU plus LV (the de Gramont regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65525 \">table 10</a>)), capecitabine, or single-agent FU (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily for five days every four weeks). Although some clinicians routinely utilize an oxaliplatin-based regimen for all patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regardless of yp status (and guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2468\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> note that an oxaliplatin-containing regimen is preferred in this setting), use of a risk-adapted treatment strategy (ie, selecting an oxaliplatin-containing regimen preferentially for those patients with lesser degrees of tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy [ie, ypT3-4 or node-positive disease]) is also reasonable. Other factors that should also be taken into account when deciding to pursue an oxaliplatin versus non-oxaliplatin-based adjuvant regimen are performance status and comorbidity.

(See <a href=\"#H608913874\" class=\"local\">'Potentially resectable metastases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who present with synchronous, unresectable stage IV disease, RT with modern combination systemic chemotherapy may allow selected patients to avoid surgery, even those with a nearly obstructing lesion.
