Intradialytic hypotension may reduce the efficacy of the dialysis procedure and contributes to the excessive morbidity and mortality that is associated with hemodialysis.</p><p>This topic reviews the etiology, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient.

Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and European Best Practice Guidelines define intradialytic hypotension as the presence of a decrease in systolic blood pressure &ge;20 mmHg or a decrease in mean arterial pressure by 10 mmHg, providing the decrease in blood pressure is associated with clinical events and need for nursing interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6716377\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic hypotension during (or immediately following) hemodialysis complicates 5 to 30 percent of all dialysis treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In one study that included 44,801 dialysis treatments in 1137 patients, 75 percent of patients had at least one episode of intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In some patients, more than 50 percent of treatments are complicated by intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Demographic risk factors that have been associated with intradialytic hypotension include older age, longer dialysis vintage, diabetes, lower predialysis blood pressure, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and higher body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The odds of&nbsp;hypotension&nbsp;occurrence decrease throughout dialysis sessions of the week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466848052\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, patients with dialysis-induced hypotension have serious medical conditions requiring immediate attention. These conditions include systemic infection, arrhythmias, pericardial tamponade, valvular disorders, myocardial infarction, hemolysis, hemorrhage, air embolism, and a reaction to the dialyzer membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. It is important to recognize such conditions. (See <a href=\"#H672307568\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-during-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications during hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactions-to-the-hemodialysis-membrane\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactions to the hemodialysis membrane&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More commonly, intradialytic hypotension occurs in the absence of serious medical conditions. Major factors that contribute to intradialytic hypotension include rapid or excessive ultrafiltration, a rapid reduction in plasma osmolality, incorrectly low prescribed target weight, autonomic neuropathy, and diminished cardiac reserve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96279\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96279 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96265 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/2,3,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8-10</a>].</p><p>Other contributors to intradialytic hypotension include the intake of antihypertensive medications or the ingestion of a meal immediately before or during dialysis.</p><p>The composition and temperature of the dialysate fluid may contribute to intradialytic hypotension. Hypotension has been associated with the use of dialysate acetate, low sodium, high magnesium, and low calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>]. Dialysate temperature that is higher than body temperature has also been associated with hypotension.</p><p>Other suggested contributors include the release of adenosine during organ ischemia, the increased synthesis of endogenous vasodilators (such as nitric oxide), and inappropriately low plasma <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/7,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13-18</a>].</p><p>Major factors are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715661298\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrafiltration, erroneous target weight, and reduction in osmolality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intradialytic hypotension commonly occurs when the ultrafiltration rate (ie, the rate at which fluid is removed) is high. In this setting, hypotension results from intravascular volume depletion beyond the level at which blood pressure can be sustained by hemodynamic compensatory mechanisms. Intravascular volume depletion may occur when the rate of fluid removal by ultrafiltration (which is from the vascular space) is significantly faster than the rate of refill of the intravascular space from the interstitial space.</p><p>Rapid ultrafiltration may be performed to attain the prescribed target weight (frequently called &quot;dry weight,&quot; which is a poorly defined and controversial term) within the prescribed duration of the dialysis session, which is typically three to five hours. This cause of intradialytic hypotension is especially common among patients who have large interdialytic weight gains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Even in the absence of large interdialytic weight gain, excessive ultrafiltration may be done to attain an inappropriately low prescribed target weight. This is generally due to the inaccurate determination of fluid status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A rapid reduction in plasma osmolality during hemodialysis may also contribute to intravascular volume depletion. The reduction in plasma osmolality causes extracellular water to move into the cells, which decreases the extracellular volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53752\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53752 \">figure 3</a>). In one study, higher calculated predialysis serum osmolarity, largely due to increased urea or glucose, but not to increased sodium, was associated with an increased risk of intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-metabolic-and-hemodynamic-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury: Metabolic and hemodynamic considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715661304\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia) occurs in over 50 percent of patients on maintenance dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with longstanding diabetes mellitus are at particularly elevated risk for autonomic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Autonomic dysfunction impairs the ability to mount a sufficient sympathetic response to maintain the systemic blood pressure during ultrafiltration. Normally (ie, in healthy individuals), a decline in blood volume leads to a decline in blood pressure, activation of the baroreceptors, and a subsequent increase in efferent sympathetic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The ensuing rise in systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output minimizes the reduction in blood pressure.</p><p>These homeostatic responses do not occur appropriately in patients with autonomic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. Mechanisms that prevent the homeostatic responses include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Downregulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors, which diminishes the hemodynamic response to endogenous catecholamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A paradoxical decrease in sympathetic and increased parasympathetic nervous system activity during ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715661351\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased cardiac reserve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of intradialytic hypotension is greatly increased in patients with a prior history of heart failure, cardiomegaly, or ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These conditions lead to poor left ventricular performance and a diminished cardiac reserve in the setting of a hemodynamic challenge. The role of diminished cardiac reserve is suggested by a study in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography was performed among 18 patients with dialysis instability and 18 without such instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The baseline cardiac index was similar in the two groups. However, cardiac reserve, as determined by the increase in cardiac index with dobutamine, was significantly lower among patients who were prone to hypotension during dialysis. Another study indicated that patients prone to intradialytic hypotension had low cardiac index and increased vascular peripheral resistance in the first 30 minutes on hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Vagal symptoms, including yawning, sighing, and hoarseness, may be observed before the drop in blood pressure is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H672307568\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute management of intradialytic hypotension includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrafiltration rate should be decreased or stopped, depending upon the severity of hypotension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg position, where the body is laid flat on the back (supine position), with the feet higher than the head by 15 to 30 degrees.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravascular volume should be replaced. We give an intravenous fluid bolus of 250 to 500 mL. Intravenous fluid is effective in restoring blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The optimal replacement fluid is not known. Common replacement fluids include isotonic saline, hypertonic glucose, 5 percent dextrose, or albumin solutions. Most clinicians use isotonic saline as first-line therapy for hypotension since saline is effective and widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>]. A randomized, controlled trial has suggested that isotonic saline and albumin are comparable in restoration of blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], although a small trial has suggested that hypertonic glucose (20 percent) may have the most pronounced effects on blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen should be administered. There is evidence that intradialytic blood oxygen saturation and its variability are associated with intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. A decrease in central venous oxygen saturation most likely indicates a decline in cardiac output (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F111472\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111472 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent hypotension despite measures above should be evaluated for evidence of an underlying serious cause. This assessment primarily includes a physical examination, including auscultation of heart and lungs, palpation of the abdomen, and examination of the hemodialysis access for evidence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/3,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,38</a>]. An electrocardiogram should be performed. Particular concerns include occult sepsis, previously unrecognized cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericardial disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rare, serious causes of hypotension on dialysis include hemolysis, reaction to dialyzer, or air embolus. Hemolysis may be suggested by the simultaneous occurrence of symptoms in multiple patients and occasionally port-wine appearance of blood in the venous line (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-during-hemodialysis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications during hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Hemolysis'</a>). Air embolus may be accompanied by distinctive clinical findings, including characteristic heart sounds. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Reactions to the dialyzer may be manifested by chest and back pain and by signs of allergic reaction (urticaria, flushing, coughing, sneezing), in addition to hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactions-to-the-hemodialysis-membrane#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactions to the hemodialysis membrane&quot;, section on 'Type A reactions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactions-to-the-hemodialysis-membrane#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactions to the hemodialysis membrane&quot;, section on 'Type B reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Hypotension that does not respond to saline bolus or is accompanied by symptoms such as fever, chills, chest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal pain, or dyspnea suggests a serious cause. Such patients are generally referred to a hospital for more extensive evaluation.</p><p>Once serious causes have been excluded, further evaluation is directed to the prevention of future episodes.

We use a stepped approach that starts with simple interventions. Subsequent evaluation and intervention depend upon patient response to initial measures. This approach is approximately similar to that suggested by the European Best Practices Guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6717398\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first-line approach includes reassessing the target weight, avoiding food intake during dialysis, withholding antihypertensive agents prior to dialysis, and limiting interdialytic sodium intake.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reassess target weight </strong>&ndash; We reassess the prescription target weight. The optimal target weight is often determined empirically by trial and error (&quot;probing&quot;). Using a trial-and-error approach, the target weight is set just above the weight at which unacceptable symptoms, such as cramping, nausea, and vomiting, or hypotension occur. Future episodes of intradialytic hypotension may be prevented in some patients by increasing the target weight. The target weight is highly variable in many patients and can fluctuate with intercurrent illnesses (such as diarrhea or infection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A large number of modalities other than the clinical examination have been evaluated in an effort to more objectively estimate target weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/19,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,39-42</a>]. These include blood volume monitoring, ultrasound assessment of the inferior vena cava, natriuretic peptide measurements, extravascular lung water indices, and bioimpedance methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among patients with intradialytic hypotension, it is reasonable to use blood volume monitoring and bioimpedance when these technologies are available. The best studies have favored methods that use bioimpedance measurements of extracellular and total body water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. A randomized, controlled trial including 126 patients indicated that fluid management with bioimpedance spectroscopy improved blood pressure control, left ventricular mass, and pulse wave velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Automatic regulation of the ultrafiltration rate combined with adjustment of dialysate sodium based upon sensor-detected changes in relative blood volume may decrease hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that included 36 hypotension-prone hemodialysis patients, the use of blood volume monitoring to adjust the ultrafiltration rate and the dialysate sodium resulted in a 30 percent reduction in intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Regulation of the ultrafiltration rate without adjustment of the dialysate sodium may not be as effective in reducing intradialytic hypotension. This was shown in a randomized crossover trial that included 26 hemodialysis patients with recurrent intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The target weight was established by clinical exam during a four-week run-in period. Patients were then assigned to an intervention group (best practice plus blood volume-guided ultrafiltration) or control (best practice alone). After eight weeks and a two-week wash-out phase, participants crossed over for a second eight-week phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There was no difference between groups in the rate of symptomatic intradialytic hypotension (0.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/hour</span> in the intervention group versus 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">07/hour</span> in the control group) or in the proportion of sessions with episodes of asymptomatic hypotension or in symptoms alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoid food during dialysis</strong> &ndash; We ask patients who are prone to intradialytic hypotension to avoid food during dialysis. Peripheral vascular resistance generally drops 20 to 120 minutes after the ingestion of food, which may cause a decrease in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/3,14,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,50,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Withhold antihypertensive agents</strong> &ndash; Patients who are prone to intradialytic hypotension should withhold antihypertensive agents prior to dialysis. Among such patients, we avoid prescribing blood pressure medications that need to be taken twice (or more) daily. Whenever possible, we prefer medications that can be given once daily and then ask patients to take the dose at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limit interdialytic sodium intake</strong> &ndash; We ask patients who are prone to intradialytic hypotension to limit sodium intake, which results in a reduction in fluid intake. Sodium intake in between dialysis directly correlates with the amount of volume that needs to be removed during each dialysis session. Excessive sodium intake results in thirst and larger extracellular volume gain that must be removed by ultrafiltration. Since the dialysis time for each session is generally fixed, the ultrafiltration rate must be increased to attain target weight by the end of the individual session. The optimal sodium intake is not known. We generally ask patients to limit sodium intake to 1 to 2 grams per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Review dialysate composition</strong> &ndash; We generally make sure that dialysate calcium and magnesium are &ge;2.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and &ge;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> respectively. Low-dialysate calcium and magnesium have been associated with intradialytic hypotension.

As noted above, the risk of intradialytic hypotension is increased in patients with heart failure, cardiomegaly, or ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease#H1410078260\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial dysfunction in end-stage renal disease&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>).

Cool-temperature dialysis has been shown to increase hemodynamic stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/53-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are two ways to perform cool-temperature hemodialysis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Empiric fixed reductions of dialysate temperature</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Isothermic dialysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If employing a fixed reduction, we reduce the dialysate temperature to 0.5 to 1.0<sup>o </sup>C<sup> </sup>below the patient&rsquo;s body temperature (as monitored by tympanic thermometer). This may lower the body temperature up to approximately 1&ordm;C. This change is generally well tolerated, although some patients develop unacceptable side effects such as chilling or cramping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In isothermic dialysis, the increase in body core temperature (which normally occurs during hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]) is sensed by a biofeedback temperature-controlled device that cools the dialysate temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. This prevents further increases in the patient&rsquo;s core temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefit of cool-temperature dialysis was assessed in a 2006 systematic review of 22 studies that evaluated 408 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]; 16 and 6 studies used empiric fixed-temperature reduction and isothermic techniques, respectively. All studies employed a crossover design. Cool-temperature dialysis was associated with markedly fewer episodes of intradialytic hypotension (7.1 times less frequent, 95% CI 5.3-8.9) and higher postdialysis mean arterial pressure (11.3 mmHg, 95% CI 7.7-15.0 mmHg). However, few trials in this meta-analysis reported on long-term, patient-important outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A second meta-analysis was reported in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. This meta-analysis included 26 trials with a total of 484 patients. Eleven of these trials (120 patients, total of 552 hemodialysis sessions, average 4.6 sessions per patient) provided sufficient information to allow calculation of the pooled effect. This analysis showed that, compared with standard dialysis, cool-temperature dialysate reduced the risk of intradialytic hypotension by 68 percent (95% CI 44-82 percent). Analysis of nine trials (2548 dialysis sessions) showed that uncomfortable symptoms on dialysis (including feeling cold, shivering, or cramps) were 2.95 times more common with cool-temperature dialysis (95% CI 0.88-9.82). Cool-temperature dialysis had no effect on dialysis adequacy or overall quality of life as assessed by the 36-question health survey assessment form. These data support that cool-temperature dialysis reduces hemodynamic instability without any negative effect on dialysis adequacy but with an increase in uncomfortable symptoms during dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanisms by which cool-temperature dialysis improves vascular stability are not completely understood. Both increased systemic vascular resistance and enhanced cardiac contractility have been observed, changes that may be mediated at least in part by cold-induced activation of the sympathetic nervous system and decreased silent ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/47,48,59,68,70-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48,59,68,70-74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The 2005 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines and 2007 European Best Practice Guidelines in hemodialysis recommend the use of cool-dialysate temperature dialysis in patients with frequent episodes of intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

This was shown in a secondary analysis of the HEMO study in which 1426 subjects were stratified by the percentage of dialysis treatments that were complicated by hypotensive episodes requiring saline infusion or reduction of either the ultrafiltration rate or blood flow. At three years of follow-up, there were 2005 episodes of vascular thrombosis.

Demographic risk factors that have been associated with intradialytic hypotension include older age, longer dialysis vintage, diabetes, lower predialysis blood pressure, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and higher body mass index. (See <a href=\"#H6716377\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H732245339\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common causes of intradialytic hypotension include rapid or excessive ultrafiltration, rapid reduction in plasma osmolality, incorrectly low prescribed target weight, autonomic neuropathy, and diminished cardiac reserve. Other contributors to intradialytic hypotension include the intake of antihypertensive medications or the ingestion of a meal immediately before or during dialysis. Occasionally, patients with dialysis-induced hypotension have serious medical conditions requiring immediate attention. These conditions include systemic infection, arrhythmias, pericardial tamponade, valvular disorders, myocardial infarction, hemolysis, hemorrhage, air embolism, and a reaction to the dialyzer membrane.
