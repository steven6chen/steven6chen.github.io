If completely localized within the capsule of the gland, some favorable-risk prostate cancers can be managed with active surveillance or potentially cured by definitive local therapy (eg, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, brachytherapy). In contrast, non-organ-confined disease is often fatal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-disseminated-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of disseminated castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Here we will provide an overview of the molecular changes that are proposed to be involved in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, particularly those that accompany metastatic disease and castration resistance.

For those cells that are androgen dependent, a critical level of androgen is required to activate a sufficient number of androgen receptors (ARs) so that transcription of death-signaling genes is expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Androgen ablation therapies allow these genes to be repressed, triggering the biochemical cascade that results in apoptotic cell death, resulting in the eradication of the large fraction of androgen-dependent cancer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In contrast, androgen ablation does not induce apoptosis in androgen-independent cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; their eventual outgrowth is responsible for the lethality of advanced disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-disseminated-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of disseminated castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although prostate cancer typically presents in men over the age of 65, a growing body of evidence suggests that prostatic carcinogenesis is initiated much earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is thought to represent a precursor of adenocarcinoma, although not all cases progress to invasive disease. One of the most pressing clinical problems presented by prostate cancer is the difficulty in predicting its clinical course based upon clinical or histologic features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=precancerous-lesions-of-the-prostate-pathology-and-clinical-implications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Precancerous lesions of the prostate: Pathology and clinical implications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prostate cancer progression has been related to a number of genetic abnormalities that affect the AR and other molecules that are involved in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A multistep process of prostate carcinogenesis has been proposed in which progressive accumulation of genetic alterations is postulated to facilitate cellular transformation from normal prostate epithelium to PIN, invasive neoplasia, and castration resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Over the last decade, a number of genes involved in or associated with prostate cancer have been identified and characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Many of these genes or their protein products are under study for their value in clinical staging (sometimes termed &quot;molecular staging&quot;) with the goal of more closely tailoring the selection of treatment to expected prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Perhaps more importantly, mechanistic studies to determine the biochemical result of specific molecular changes might reveal additional targets for therapy. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of prostate cancers, the variability in analytic techniques, and the lack of suitable model systems for different stages of prostate progression have hampered progress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS AND CANDIDATE GENES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), comparative genomic hybridization, and microsatellite analysis have demonstrated losses or gains in various chromosomes that are associated with prostate cancer progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. In many instances, the target gene or genes have been identified. Further advances in positional cloning technology and the information provided by the human genome project are expected to facilitate the identification of candidate genes within these chromosomal regions.</p><p>There are three categories of chromosomal changes that may play a role in the development and progression of prostate cancer: those that are associated with genetic predisposition (eg, 1q deletions), somatic alterations that result in amplification of presumed oncogenes (eg, 7p and 8q), and somatic alterations that result in the loss of function of presumed tumor suppressor genes (eg, 8p, 10q, 12q, 13q, and 17p). Here we will provide an overview of selected molecular changes that occur during prostate cancer development and progression, with a particular emphasis on their prognostic and therapeutic value. Specific details of these chromosomal alterations are beyond the scope of this review and are discussed more in depth elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>Genetic factors that may influence prostate cancer risk are discussed elsewhere.

These mutations either accelerate cellular growth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proliferation (eg, c-myc, beta catenin, human epidermal growth factor 2 [HER2], Ras), or facilitate abnormal cell division (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 [MKP-1], B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> [bcl-2], telomerase).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">c-myc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gain of chromosome 8q sequences is a common feature of prostate cancer, particularly metastatic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The target gene is not known, but one candidate is c-myc, which is amplified in a subset of advanced tumors. The myc oncogene, located at chromosome 8q24, encodes a nuclear protein that is involved in the control of normal cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Increasing levels of overexpression correlate with advancing stage and grade of prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>], and high levels of amplification are found in a subset of men with androgen-independent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">MKP-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several oncogenes involved in prostate carcinogenesis activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, which can relay both proliferative (via extracellular regulated kinases [ERK]) and apoptotic signals (via Jun N-terminal protein kinases [JNK]) to the nucleus. MKP-1 is a dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatase that dephosphorylates both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues on the JNK and ERK MAP kinases, providing overall protection from apoptotic influences. Overexpression of MKP-1 has been detected in the earliest stages of prostate cancer, including prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In one report of 51 prostate cancers, MKP-1 was overexpressed in PIN lesions, but its expression decreased with higher histologic grade and advanced disease stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Bcl-2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overexpression of the bcl-2 oncogene by prostate cancers confers resistance to apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and upregulation of bcl-2 (particularly in conjunction with p53 mutations, see below) is a frequent and important step in the progression to advanced or castration-resistant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. Bcl-2 tends to be expressed more strongly as malignant change progresses along the continuum from preinvasive to metastatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. As a result, the bcl-2 protein is a potential target for clinical intervention, particularly using antisense molecules such as oblimersen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Its value as a prognostic marker is less certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Telomerase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures that cap the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Because of incomplete DNA replication at the ends of chromosomes, telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division in eukaryotic cells. This progressive loss of telomeres is postulated to be the &quot;clock&quot; by which normal cells senesce with age, and telomere maintenance appears to be an important regulator of cellular life span.</p><p>Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme, compensates for telomere shortening during cell division by synthesizing telomeric DNA, thereby maintaining telomere length. In normal somatic cells, telomerase activity is usually undetectable, with the exception of hematopoietic cells, hair follicles, intestinal crypt cells, and epidermal basal cells. In contrast, upregulation of telomerase and amplification of telomeric DNA are detected in many cancers, including up to 90 percent of prostate cancers, and in high-grade PIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/42-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-48</a>]. Higher-grade cancers appear to have maximally elevated telomerase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Telomerase has been exploited both as a diagnostic tool and a therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer. A urinary assay for telomerase has been proposed as a noninvasive means of detecting prostate cancer, while the therapeutic potential of agents targeting telomerase and telomere-associated enzymes is beginning to be explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta catenin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The catenin family of proteins is thought to play a critical role in cell-cell adhesion. However, the role of beta catenin in prostate tumorigenesis appears to be distinct from cell adhesion. Although most cases of prostate cancer show downregulation of beta catenin at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>], approximately 5 percent contain activating mutations within the beta catenin gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. This gain of function mutation results in protein stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus, where beta catenin forms a transcriptional complex that is capable of upregulating target genes, such as the androgen receptor (AR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/52,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,54</a>]. Up to 20 percent of lethal prostate cancers contain nuclear beta catenin, suggesting a more common role in advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Ras pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Ras oncogene is thought to be important in pathogenesis in many human malignancies (eg, non-small cell lung cancer).</p><p>In prostate cancer, Ras amplification does not seem to play a major role in disease initiation and development in American men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>], although somewhat higher mutation rates are reported in Japanese men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>In contrast, epigenetic inactivation of the <em>RASSF1A</em> gene (located on chromosome 3p21) via promoter methylation is present in approximately 60 to 70 percent of prostate cancers, particularly more-aggressive tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p>An alternative mechanism for prostate cancer pathogenesis involves the <em>DAB2IP </em>gene, which encodes a protein that is a negative regulator of the Ras signal transduction pathway. A polymorphism of <em>DAB2IP</em> was associated with aggressive prostate cancer in an exploratory genome-wide association study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">HER2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protein product of the HER2 oncogene (also known as c-erbB-2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Its role in prostate tumorigenesis is controversial. HER2 protein overexpression is detected in 20 to 25 percent of hormone-naive primary tumors and in 60 to 78 percent of cancers following androgen ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. However, the biologic significance of this finding is unclear. With the exception of one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], high-level amplification of the gene, representing the predominant mechanism of HER2 pathway activation (at least in breast cancer), is not observed in prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/20,64,65,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,64,65,67,68</a>].

Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme in this process. In prostate cancers, FASN expression is thought to function as an oncogene by preventing apoptosis. This is documented by the increased cell proliferation and tumorigenic growth of FASN-expressing prostate cell lines and transgenic models, as well as in human prostate specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20797464\"><span class=\"h3\">HOXB13</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The homeobox B13 (<em>HOXB13</em>) gene codes for a transcription factor that is important in prostate development.

Fusion of the androgen-regulated gene <em>TMPRSS2</em> and the ETS transcription family members (ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5) has been described as one of the most common recurrent genomic alterations in prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to account for the acquisition of castration resistance. A detailed review of the specific molecular changes that are associated with castration resistance is beyond the scope of this discussion, although these changes are well reviewed elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/15,192\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,192</a>].

Such mutations in the steroid binding domain may alter ligand specificity, allowing other nonandrogenic steroids, as well as antiandrogens, to bind and activate the mutant AR, even when the level of systemic androgen is fully suppressed. <em>AR</em> mutations have been most intensely studied in the context of the antiandrogen withdrawal response, in which acquired mutations in the <em>AR </em>are thought to result in a paradoxical stimulatory effect of antiandrogens on prostate tumor cells. Mutations in the hormone binding domain of the <em>AR</em> have been detected in a small fraction of bone marrow specimens of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-biology-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/200-202\" class=\"abstract_t\">200-202</a>].
