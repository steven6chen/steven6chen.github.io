Since this lesion is frequently asymptomatic and may not be detected on physical examination, it is often diagnosed solely by echocardiography. This topic will review the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features associated with regurgitation of the tricuspid valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Management and prognosis of TR and Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve are discussed separately.

On echocardiography, this &quot;normal&quot; or physiological degree of regurgitation is localized to a small region adjacent to valve closure, often does not extend throughout systole, and has a low signal strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Abnormal degrees of TR in adults are largely secondary (ie, related to tricuspid annular dilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leaflet tethering in the setting of right ventricular [RV] pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume overload) and much less often due to primary disorders of the valve apparatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The frequency of TR as well as valvular pathology was evaluated in a study of 5223 adults (predominantly male with a mean age of 67) who underwent echocardiography at three Veterans Affairs medical centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Moderate to severe TR was present in 819 (15.7 percent), but only 8 percent had primary tricuspid valve pathology.</p><p>Implantable device leads that cross the tricuspid valve may cause acute or chronic TR, which can be progressive. The causes of pacer-associated TR include: effects of chronic RV pacing on RV geometry and systolic function, direct impingement on leaflet motion, foreign body inflammation and fibrosis of the leaflets, thrombosis, and endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. In a retrospective series of 239 patients undergoing first device implantation with either a pacer or cardioverter-defibrillator lead crossing the tricuspid valve, 38 percent developed significant lead-associated TR within 1 to 1.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary TR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TR in adults is most commonly secondary (or functional), defined as regurgitation with apparently anatomically normal leaflets and chords. The cause of secondary TR most likely is dilatation of the right atrium and RV with dilation of the tricuspid annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and tethering of the tricuspid valve leaflets, although the mechanism of valve dysfunction has not been fully defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. RV dilatation, tricuspid annular dilatation, and tricuspid leaflet tethering may result from any condition that directly involves the RV or causes elevation in RV systolic pressure often with pulmonary hypertension.</p><p>In an echocardiographic study of 242 patients with severe TR, TR was secondary in 219 patients (90 percent), most often <span class=\"nowrap\">(157/219</span> or 72 percent) in association with documented significant pulmonary hypertension (defined as pulmonary artery pressure &gt;50 mmHg; causes unspecified) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There were 58 patients (26 percent) with severe secondary TR who did not have documented significant pulmonary hypertension. However, approximately half of these patients had factors suggestive of undocumented pulmonary hypertension or occult tricuspid disease including organic mitral disease, severe left ventricular dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe mitral regurgitation. In the 23 patients (2 percent) with severe secondary TR and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension, six had tricuspid valve malcoaptation and two had indeterminate coaptation. In the 15 patients with no evident cause of severe TR, 14 had a history of atrial fibrillation (AF; 7 percent of the total secondary TR group). In other studies, severe secondary TR has been attributed to <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>The disorders that induce pulmonary hypertension and secondary RV dilatation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left-sided heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral stenosis or regurgitation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary pulmonary disease &ndash; Cor pulmonale, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension of any cause</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left to right shunt &ndash; Atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, anomalous pulmonary venous return</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eisenmenger syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenosis of the pulmonic valve or pulmonary artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Examples of RV diseases causing secondary TR include cardiomyopathies affecting one or both ventricles and ischemic heart disease, which may involve the RV myocardial and tricuspid papillary muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Factors predictive of TR severity were evaluated in an echocardiographic review of 2139 patients without primary tricuspid valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe TR was associated with higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), AF, right atrial and RV enlargement, left ventricular dysfunction, and primary mitral valve disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate or severe TR was associated with most of these factors, as well as presence of an RV pacemaker lead, older age, and female gender.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although TR severity was associated with higher PASP, many patients with pulmonary hypertension had only mild TR (65 percent of patients with PASP 50 to 69 mmHg and 46 percent with PASP &ge;70 mmHg).</p><p/><p>Severe secondary TR is also associated with AF, but whether the effects of TR such as right atrial enlargement increase the likelihood of AF or whether chronic AF increases the likelihood of TR is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary TR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TR in adults is less often due to processes that directly affect the tricuspid valve (primary or &quot;organic&quot; valve disease); for example, primary tricuspid valve disease was found in only 23 patients (10 percent) of 242 patients with severe TR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Causes of primary TR include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct valve injury from a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead placement or removal or from endomyocardial biopsy in cardiac transplant recipients.

Acquired TR is rare in adolescents and young adults except for occasional cases due to trauma, infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users, and valve injury due to the jet through a small ventricular septal defect.

Since the right atrium is relatively compliant, there are often no major hemodynamic consequences with mild or moderately severe TR. However, when TR is severe, right atrial and venous pressures rise and can result in the signs and symptoms of right-sided heart failure, including ascites and liver failure. In such patients, chronic right ventricular pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume overload frequently lead to right ventricular systolic dysfunction and a low forward cardiac output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamics-of-valvular-disorders-as-measured-by-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Elevated central venous pressure in patients with severe TR may contribute to impaired renal function regardless of the etiology of the regurgitant lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Studies have shown that increasing intra-abdominal or central venous pressure, which should also increase renal venous pressure, reduced glomerular filtration rate. Such an effect is not closely related to the cardiac output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology#H2022699\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Definition, prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Increased renal venous pressure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3569351977\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are often no specific symptoms associated with mild or moderate TR alone. With severe disease, there may be a sensation of pulsation in the neck (from the distended and pulsatile jugular veins) and symptoms of right-sided heart failure (HF) such as painful hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Some patients with severe TR remain asymptomatic for many years. It remains unclear why some patients tolerate this lesion and others do not.</p><p>Symptoms may also arise from the underlying cause of regurgitation. As an example, pulmonary hypertension (whether primary or secondary) may lead to symptoms of low cardiac output, including fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance. Patients with carcinoid valve disease often present with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome with cardiac involvement only diagnosed after imaging studies.

A dilated pulmonary artery may also be suggested by dullness and a prominent pulsation over the left second intercostal space, a finding most often observed with pulmonary hypertension. When the TR is very severe, a pulsation may be detected along the right sternal border due to flow into the right atrium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascites and peripheral edema of variable severity may be present, and anasarca can occur in severe disease.

When the RV is very enlarged, the murmur may even be appreciated at the apex. There is usually little radiation of the murmur, and a thrill is generally not palpable. However, the murmur of TR is often soft or absent, even when regurgitation is severe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diastolic murmurs are usually absent in TR, although a diastolic rumble may be heard particularly if there is associated tricuspid stenosis or when there is substantial blood flow across the tricuspid valve during diastole, which may occur with an atrial septal defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions that result in an increase in venous return (leg raising, exercise, hepatic compression) will augment the murmur of TR. The murmur may also become louder after a premature beat and prolonged diastole. On the other hand, reducing venous return (with standing) will diminish the intensity of the murmur. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, the intensity of the murmur may change with changes in pulmonary artery pressure.

It is much less commonly caused by primary valve disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of primary acquired tricuspid valve disease leading to TR include valve injury from a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead, chest trauma, endocarditis, rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome, ischemic disease affecting the RV, and myxomatous degeneration associated with tricuspid valve prolapse. Ebstein's anomaly is the most common congenital cause of TR. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of severe TR are variable. They may include a sensation of pulsation in the neck and symptoms of right-sided heart failure such as painful hepatosplenomegaly and edema. However, some patients with severe TR remain asymptomatic for many years. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical findings that may be seen with severe TR include jugular venous distention, RV heave, peripheral edema, ascites, and hepatomegaly. A holosystolic murmur of TR may be heard but this may be soft or absent even when the TR is severe. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiography and chest radiography may reveal findings reflective of right atrial and RV enlargement and concomitant left heart disease, if present. (See <a href=\"#H1531762465\" class=\"local\">'Initial tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography is the main diagnostic modality for evaluation of TR. It enables evaluation of the severity of TR, valve morphology, right chamber sizes and RV function, estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure, as well as assessment of any concomitant left heart disease. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful if echocardiographic evaluation is suboptimal or inconclusive for assessment of TR severity and RV size and function.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fender EA, Zack CJ, Nishimura RA.
