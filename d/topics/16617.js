Classic intermittent claudication is a reproducible discomfort of a defined group of muscles that is induced by exercise and relieved with rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, atypical leg pain is more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most patients with intermittent claudication remain stable with medical therapy. When revascularization is required, the options are percutaneous interventional procedures and surgery. </p><p>This topic will review the general indications for revascularization in patients with claudication, and the outcomes of lower extremity bypass surgery. The roles of medical therapy, percutaneous revascularization, and the management of limb-threatening ischemia are discussed separately.

The severity of symptoms depends upon the degree of stenosis, the collateral circulation, and the vigor of exercise. Most patients with intermittent claudication remain stable with medical therapy. When revascularization is required, the options are percutaneous interventional procedures and surgery.

Type A lesions represent focal short stenosis of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries while Type D lesions represent diffuse disease and chronic occlusions. There are no classifications referable to the tibial vessels. Type B and Type C are intermediate lesions. The details of the TASC classification are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

Patients with Type B lesions who fail endovascular management may also benefit from surgery. The patient's comorbidities, fully informed patient preference, and the long-term success rates must be considered when making treatment recommendations for Type B and Type C lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR REVASCULARIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) and other guidelines suggest that the following issues need to be addressed when considering either percutaneous or surgical revascularization in patients with intermittent claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has not had or is not predicted to have an adequate response to exercise rehabilitation and pharmacologic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is significantly disabled by claudication, resulting in an inability to perform normal work or other activities that are important to the patient. This criterion reflects the symptom variability among patients with claudication and of the impact of these symptoms on the quality of life. In addition, there may be substantial differences between patient and physician assessments of the quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is able to benefit from an improvement in claudication (ie, exercise is not limited by another cause, such as angina, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or orthopedic problems).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The projected natural history and prognosis of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristics of the lesion permit appropriate intervention at low risk with a high likelihood of initial and long-term success. Numerous studies have shown that successful revascularization can substantially improve the patient's quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p/><p>The need to intervene is more urgent in patients with limb-threatening ischemia, as manifested by rest pain, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-limb-threatening-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF PATIENTS FOR SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the availability of less invasive percutaneous procedures, the 2005 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) guidelines and the 2007 Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) consensus document on the management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) recommended initial revascularization with surgery only when the arterial anatomy is not favorable for a percutaneous approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H519588509\" class=\"local\">'Lesions best treated with surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>Sometimes a patient remains disabled from claudication after attempts at medical therapy and percutaneous revascularization by angioplasty. In this setting, surgical revascularization procedures for intermittent claudication can be performed provided the patient has favorable anatomy for open surgery. In general, surgery should be reserved for low-risk patients with disabling symptoms who can be expected to tolerate the procedure and live long enough to enjoy the improved quality of life. The same criteria are used in diabetics even though they are at higher risk for a worse outcome. Patients who benefit most from elective surgical revascularization are generally under 70 years of age, nondiabetic, and have little evidence of disease distal to the primary lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This general approach may differ in very young patients (&lt;40 years of age) with claudication. Symptoms in this group of patients are typically due to a far more aggressive atherosclerotic disease process than that experienced by the majority of older patients with claudication. The aggressive nature of arteriosclerosis obliterans in young individuals was demonstrated in a retrospective series of 29 vascular reconstructions in patients under the age of 40, 76 percent of which were for intermittent claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average mortality rate at 10 years following initial surgery was 31 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial vascular reconstructions failed in 72 percent, with an amputation rate of 17 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the end of the follow-up period, only 25 percent of surviving patients were asymptomatic</p><p/><p>These results suggest that one should be cautious before considering patients in this group for surgical revascularization.</p><p>Regardless of whether surgery is performed, all patients with claudication should undergo evaluation and treatment of atherosclerotic risk factors (eg, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia). Risk factor modification reduces the incidence of not only limb loss but also myocardial infarction. Patients who do not have surgery may also benefit from other forms of medical management, including supervised exercise and medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular surgery is considered a high-risk surgical procedure. As a result, preoperative risk stratification should be performed in all patients. The perioperative evaluation and risk reduction strategies are discussed separately.

Although exceptions can occur, there is a general association between the site of claudication and the site of the atherosclerotic lesion. (See <a href=\"#H519588351\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, the surgical procedures, complications, and success rate of surgery depend upon the area affected. Aortoiliac disease is also called inflow disease. Claudication resulting from disease in this location often tends to be more disabling. However, surgical procedures for aortoiliac disease, such as aortobifemoral bypass, tend to be quite durable. For these reasons, the threshold to intervene when treating claudication for inflow disease is generally lower than that for infrainguinal disease (outflow disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Guideline recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2005 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, which were produced in collaboration with major vascular medicine, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology societies, made the following recommendations for surgery in patients with aortoiliac (inflow) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with unilateral disease with acceptable aortic inflow, surgical procedures include aortoiliac bypass, iliac endarterectomy, or iliofemoral bypass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with bilateral aortoiliac disease, aortobifemoral bypass grafting is the ideal surgical procedure; however, if the patient is not a suitable candidate, then one of the unilateral procedures listed above or a unilateral percutaneous procedure can be combined with femoral-femoral bypass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axillofemoral bypass should only be used to treat claudication in very limited settings, such as chronic infra-aortic occlusion associated with severe symptoms in a patient who is not a candidate for aortobifemoral bypass or to manage an infected graft in a symptomatic patient. </p><p/><p>For infrainguinal (outflow) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bypasses to the popliteal artery above or below the knee should be constructed with an autogenous vein from the ipsilateral or contralateral lower extremity, whenever possible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of synthetic grafts to the popliteal artery above the knee is approximately equivalent to autogenous vein for the first two years, and then the patency curves tend to diverge with lower patency thereafter in the prosthetic grafts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It may be reasonable to use a synthetic graft to the popliteal artery below the knee, only if no autogenous vein is available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evidence is less well established for femorotibial artery bypass, an approach that may be considered for claudication in rare instances. Femorotibial bypasses with synthetic grafts should be avoided.</p><p/><p>These recommendations, in part, reflect different rates of long-term graft patency. (See <a href=\"#H519588987\" class=\"local\">'Long-term outcome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortoiliac occlusive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atherosclerotic lesions in the aortoiliac location generally begin at the bifurcation of the aorta or the common iliac arteries and can progress in either direction. In general, patients complaining of claudication due to isolated aortoiliac disease tend to be younger than those in whom claudication is due to disease of the femoropopliteal system. In addition, lesions of the aortoiliac system are less likely to cause symptoms compared with the distal lower extremity arteries since there is an extensive collateral system in this area.</p><p>On the other hand, claudication as a result of aortoiliac disease may result in greater disability due to the larger number of muscle groups directly perfused by these vessels. Furthermore, patients with lesions in this area, regardless of lumen diameter, are at risk for distal embolization; this complication has been described as &quot;blue toe syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For these reasons, as well as the excellent long-term surgical results obtained in these patients, a more aggressive approach to claudication as a result of aortoiliac disease is taken with some patients undergoing aortoiliac reconstructive surgery who would not be offered more distal procedures.</p><p>In one study evaluating functional outcome after surgical treatment for intermittent claudication, 62 percent of the procedures performed for claudication were inflow procedures (reconstruction procedures above the inguinal ligament, such as an aortobifemoral bypass), the great majority of which were for aortoiliac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Primary unassisted patency (patent without further intervention) at four years for this group was 92 percent with no operative deaths.</p><p>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is another revascularization option for selected patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Infrainguinal occlusive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent calf claudication is usually due to a lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery. In most cases, multiple lesions at various levels, and particularly distal disease (tibial vessels), are required to progress to limb-threatening ischemia. </p><p>An early study of over 50 femoropopliteal bypass grafts for intermittent claudication found that perioperative mortality was zero, with only a single patient requiring below-knee amputation 12 years after the initial procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cumulative graft patency was 93 percent at two years and 88 percent at five years. These patency rates are clearly superior to collective results of femoropopliteal graft patency performed for limb salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other series of reconstructive procedures have also demonstrated an operative mortality rate of near zero in carefully selected patients with claudication (eg, those with low cardiac risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. The potential for significant lifestyle improvement in patients with disabling claudication and femoropopliteal occlusive disease, and the excellent record of safety related to surgery, has led to a degree of liberalization in the indications for and the performance of reconstructive procedures.</p><p>Operative results for infrainguinal occlusive disease are generally quite good. This applies both to femoropopliteal bypass grafts and to procedures involving more distal vessels. The efficacy of surgery in the latter setting can be illustrated by the results from two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series evaluated patients undergoing infrainguinal revascularization for intermittent claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, 96 percent of surviving patients had a patent graft, with a primary unassisted patency at four years of 81 percent. In this report, there were no operative deaths or early or late amputations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study evaluated 57 femorotibial bypass procedures performed for claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This group represented only 5 percent of all infrainguinal vein reconstructions performed at the reporting institution over a 16-year period. There were no operative deaths. Overall five-year survival was 54 percent, and no major amputations were performed. Cumulative primary and secondary graft patency at five years were 81 and 86 percent, respectively. These rates were equivalent to those achieved with femoropopliteal bypass for claudication and were significantly better than the rates for limb salvage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend periodic follow-up after surgery for claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Follow-up consists of periodic clinical evaluations that should note any return or progression of symptoms of claudication, the presence of pulses, and measurement of the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) at rest and after exercise, as needed, and for infrainguinal bypass duplex imaging of the entire length of the graft with measurement of peak systolic velocity and calculation of velocity ratio across all lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Ankle-brachial index'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplex ultrasound surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) is considered the best method for detecting graft stenosis. Graft surveillance has been found in one randomized and multiple other prospective studies to improve long-term patency of vein grafts, but the same benefit has not been shown for prosthetic grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Intrinsic graft lesions, which are those most commonly identified by DUS, can be monitored for progression by DUS. Untreated, high-grade intrinsic graft stenoses almost universally result in graft occlusion. The purpose of DUS surveillance is to prevent graft occlusion; it is very effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>].</p><p>Assisted patency refers to grafts that undergo a revision (such as balloon angioplasty or bypass of a stenosis) prior to actual thrombosis of the graft. Grafts that are carefully monitored following grafting and in which a detected stenosis is addressed (eg, balloon angioplasty or bypass of the stenotic segment) do far better in the long term than grafts that are revised only following complete thrombosis. </p><p>Failure is a major concern for vein bypass grafts, and its prevention requires surveillance. There are three major time periods for graft failure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure in the immediate or early postoperative period (&lt;30 days) is most often due to technical complications or judgmental error.

A Cochrane review of trials of antiplatelet therapy found a beneficial effect of such treatment on graft patency, with an odds ratio (OR) for primary occlusion at 12 months of 0.59 (95% CI 0.45-0.79) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Patients with an indication for anticoagulation were excluded. Although vorapaxar did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke among PAD patients, it significantly reduced the rate of acute limb ischemia (2.3 versus 3.9 percent) and peripheral revascularization (18 versus 22 percent), but bleeding occurred more frequently in the group that received vorapaxar compared with placebo (7.4 versus 4.5 percent). </p><p>In a follow-up analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-claudication/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vorapaxar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vorapaxar</a> was found to significantly reduce the risk of first acute limb ischemia (ALI) event compared with placebo (HR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86) and also significantly reduced total ALI events (94 versus 56 events). A total of 178 first and recurrent ALI events were identified in 133 patients during a median follow-up of 2.5 years, with most, 150 (84.3 percent), occurring in those with symptomatic PAD. The remaining 28 (15.8 percent) occurred in the myocardial infarction or stroke cohorts, the majority of whom also had a known history of PAD. There were no differences in baseline characteristics, including baseline other medical therapy, between those with and without ALI. The causes of the 150 critical limb ischemia events in the PAD group were surgical graft thrombosis in 93 (62 percent), native vessel in-situ thromboses in 37 (25 percent), stent thromboses in 14 (9 percent), and thromboembolism in 6 (4 percent).

The location of pain depends upon the vessels that are involved, and symptom severity depends upon the degree of stenosis, the adequacy of collateral circulation, and the level of exercise. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients presenting with claudication due to peripheral artery disease should be treated to reduce their cardiovascular risk and, for patients undergoing lower extremity bypass, to improve long-term graft patency. Antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 75 to 325 mg) is effective at reducing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death in individuals with symptomatic atherosclerotic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD), including those with critical limb ischemia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clopidogrel</a> is an alternative to aspirin in those who cannot take aspirin. Other risk factor reduction strategies include smoking cessation and controlling hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and blood sugar. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative risk assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with intermittent claudication remain stable with medical therapy. Claudication improves or remains stable in 70 to 80 percent of patients but worsens in 10 to 20 percent. Revascularization is indicated for patients with disabling claudication that does not respond to conventional medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the characterization of a given arterial lesion, a patient with claudication might benefit from a surgery-first or an angioplasty-first approach. Based upon overall success rates for treating aortoiliac, femoral, and popliteal disease using endovascular or surgical means, the Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC) classification groups arterial lesions into those favoring endovascular therapy (Type A, Type B) and those favoring surgery (Type D, Type C). The TASC classification, however, does not provide guidance for the treatment of tibial vessel disease or multilevel disease. Given the availability of less invasive percutaneous procedures, guidelines from multiple societies on the management of PAD have recommended initial revascularization with surgery for patients with claudication when the arterial anatomy is not favorable for a percutaneous approach. A patient who remains symptomatic in spite of medical therapy and attempts at percutaneous revascularization is a candidate for surgical revascularization provided the patient has favorable anatomy and does not have a prohibitive risk for open surgery. (See <a href=\"#H519588422\" class=\"local\">'TASC classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients for surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortoiliac disease is also called inflow disease. Claudication resulting from inflow problems tends to be more disabling than isolated infrainguinal disease. The threshold to intervene for inflow disease is generally lower than for infrainguinal disease (outflow disease). Among patients with aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease, the American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC)/American</span> Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that inflow lesions be addressed first (surgery or percutaneous intervention). Once this has been accomplished, infrainguinal revascularization is warranted for persistent symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoropopliteal bypass offers the potential for significant lifestyle improvement in patients with disabling claudication and has an excellent record of safety. Cumulative five-year graft patency approaches 90 percent, and operative mortality is near zero for properly selected patients with claudication (eg, those with low cardiac risk). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Infrainguinal occlusive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following revascularization, periodic clinical evaluations should note any return or progression of symptoms of claudication, the presence of pulses, and measurement of the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) at both rest and after exercise, as needed, and for infrainguinal bypass, duplex imaging of the entire length of the graft to evaluate for graft stenosis. Vein graft stenosis develops in 20 to 30 percent of infrainguinal vein bypasses during the first year and can lead to graft failure. We prefer to examine grafts perioperatively and at six weeks postoperatively, then at three-month intervals for two years, and every six months thereafter. Grafts that are monitored and treated when a significant stenosis is identified have better long-term patency rates (82 to 93 percent versus 30 to 50 percent) compared with those that require thrombectomy and revision following a complete thrombosis.
