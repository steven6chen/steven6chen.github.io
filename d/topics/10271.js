Male dyspareunia is defined as recurrent or persistent genital or pelvic pain with sexual activity or sexual dysfunction that is present for three months or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The condition often leads to embarrassment and may be difficult for the patient and clinician to discuss openly.</p><p>Most studies describing male dyspareunia are small case reports. Few long-term studies have been published, with the majority of reports on associated conditions such as chronic prostatitis or Peyronie's disease.</p><p>This topic will focus on the epidemiology, etiology, classification, diagnosis, and management of male dyspareunia that is not the result of infectious conditions (eg, acute urethritis, acute cystitis, acute prostatitis), which are discussed elsewhere.

However, because of the social stigma associated with male sexual disorders, underreporting appears to be common. It is not known whether the low reported incidence of dyspareunia in males represents a lack of disclosure or reflects the true infrequency of this condition. In the absence of an identifiable genitourinary abnormality, uncircumcised men are more likely than circumcised men to report dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This association is not entirely explained by scratches, abrasions, cuts, and bleeding with sexual intercourse in uncircumcised men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The male patient complaining of pelvic pain during sexual activity presents a challenge for the primary care practitioner because of the lack of a uniformly accepted classification system.

The incidence increases in men with other lower urinary tract symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>There are multiple causes of painful ejaculation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56865 \">table 2</a>). Painful ejaculation sometimes results from ejaculatory duct obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Common presentations of painful ejaculation can include penile pain, perineal ache, or suprapubic discomfort occurring during or after the ejaculatory period. Pain is sometimes experienced in the testicular or glans area of the penis immediately after ejaculation or may result from perineal muscle spasm. Atypical pain with ejaculation can also occur in the abdomen, urethral meatus, or rectum. Intense perineal discomfort immediately after ejaculation can occur without evidence of infection or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Painful ejaculation can have a significant impact on quality of life, negatively affecting patient self-esteem and reducing his desire for sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Particular attention should focus on other urinary symptoms, ejaculation history, congenital or acquired disorders (eg, Peyronie's disease, phimosis), psychosexual issues (eg, fear of relationships, prior child or sexual abuse), and other contributing factors (eg, trauma to region, past surgery, medications). Patients should be asked if pain occurs with noncoital sexual activity including masturbation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination focuses on the genital and rectal areas with particular attention to the prostate, and anal sphincter tone.</p><p>The penis should be examined for abnormal curvature, which may be more noticeable when erect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76294 \">figure 1</a>), Peyronie's plaques, phimosis, short frenulum, and superficial lesions. The scrotum should be examined for testicular abnormalities. Prostatic tenderness supports the diagnosis of acute prostatitis or chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">prostatitis/chronic</span> pelvic pain syndrome. Palpation of the pelvic floor musculature during digital rectal examination may reveal tenderness or spasticity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Performing the bulbocavernosus reflex is important for initial diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The bulbocavernosus reflex is a polysynaptic reflex that is useful in testing S2-S4 nerve impairment. The test involves monitoring anal sphincter contraction in response to squeezing the glans penis. The absence of the reflex without a history of sacral spinal cord trauma may indicate nerve entrapment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H735505970\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinalysis, urine culture, and urinary assays for sexually transmitted infections should be performed in patients who have dysuria or other urinary symptoms to rule out infectious causes.

Anatomical problems, including Peyronie&rsquo;s disease, phimosis, and frenulum breve, are usually evidenced by history and physical examination. Pudendal nerve entrapment is suggested by an absent bulbocavernosus reflex. Concern for ejaculatory duct obstruction, including findings of hypospermia, may prompt prostate imaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p>Genitourinary infection is suggested by dysuria, urethral discharge, and testicular <span class=\"nowrap\">swelling/tenderness</span> and is confirmed by results of urine testing.</p><p>Other etiologies are generally diagnoses of exclusion but can be suggested by certain features. As an example, if pain is not restricted to sexual activity, chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">prostatitis/chronic</span> pelvic pain syndrome should also be explored (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome&quot;</a>). An underlying psychologic basis should be considered in patients with dyspareunia who do not report pain with masturbation.</p><p>When initial evaluation by the primary care practitioner does not lead to an evident cause, referral for urologic consultation is recommended. Radiological and urodynamic studies may be indicated for the evaluation of other urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia or hematuria.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 1 to 5 percent of men complain of dyspareunia. However, the condition may be underreported in the population because of social stigma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male dyspareunia can be classified into four broad categories: isolated painful ejaculation, chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">prostatitis/chronic</span> pelvic pain, medical causes, and other causes of sexual pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75173\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75173 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most conditions associated with male dyspareunia can be diagnosed by history and physical examination. Laboratory and imaging studies are usually unnecessary. When initial evaluation by the primary care practitioner does not lead to an evident cause, referral for urologic consultation is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of male dyspareunia is directed at the underlying cause whenever possible. Peyronie&rsquo;s disease, phimosis, frenulum breve, herniorrhaphy sequelae, and pudendal nerve entrapment are generally addressed by surgical intervention. For patients with idiopathic dyspareunia, we suggest medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, which are effective in the treatment of chronic pain, or an alpha-1 receptor blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamsulosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamsulosin</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If the clinician identifies a psychologic basis, referral to a sexual counseling specialist is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4052780313\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Mathew Oommen, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-dyspareunia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Luzzi G, Law L.
