The inflammation is most commonly caused by a virus or a bacterium, which travels from an infection in another part of the body through the bloodstream to the meninges. The treatment and long-term outlook of meningitis differ considerably based upon the cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGITIS CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of meningitis: viral and bacterial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many types of bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis. The most likely type depends upon the child's age, history of vaccinations, and current or past medical problems. The two most common causes of bacterial meningitis in older infants and children in the United States are bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus and Neisseria meningitidis or meningococcus. </p><p>Certain factors can increase a child's risk of developing bacterial meningitis, including recent exposure to someone with bacterial meningitis, recent infection (eg, ear or sinus infection), travel to areas where bacterial meningitis is common (eg, sub-Saharan Africa), serious head injury, problems with the immune system, cochlear implants, and certain anatomic abnormalities.</p><p>Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency that must be treated quickly to minimize the risk of serious illness or even death. Even when treated appropriately, children who recover from bacterial meningitis sometimes have long-term complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of viral meningitis is a family of viruses called enterovirus. In the United States, enteroviral meningitis is seen more frequently from June to October. Enteroviruses are spread by direct contact with feces during activities such as diaper changing or indirectly through contaminated water, food, and surfaces.</p><p>Other viruses that cause meningitis can be spread by airborne droplets, direct contact, during birth, or through the bite of an animal (eg, rabies) or bug (eg, mosquito, tick).</p><p>In developed countries, viral meningitis is more common than bacterial meningitis and is generally less severe. Children with viral meningitis usually recover completely with supportive treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGITIS SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although bacterial meningitis is usually more severe, the signs and symptoms of bacterial and viral meningitis can be similar. It is often not possible to know whether a child has bacterial or viral meningitis based upon symptoms alone. The most common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborns may develop a fever accompanied by nonspecific symptoms (eg, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, rash). The infant may have a stiff neck or bulging fontanel (soft spot on the skull) and may be irritable, restless, or lethargic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children may develop a sudden fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, stiff neck, and complain that light bothers their eyes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis can cause seizures, and decreased level of awareness. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain types of bacterial meningitis may be associated with petechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89718\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89718 \">picture 1</a>) and purpura (red to purplish spots on the skin that do not blanch with pressure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89719\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89719 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of viral meningitis can resemble those of the flu, including fever, muscle aches, runny nose, and cough. One type of viral meningitis causes a slightly red to pink skin rash.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases symptoms worsen slowly, over one to two days, while in other cases the symptoms worsen rapidly over hours.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGITIS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency that must be treated promptly, it is important to determine the cause of the child's symptoms as quickly as possible. The following tests are generally recommended, and are usually performed in a hospital emergency department:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood culture &ndash; A sample of blood is cultured in the laboratory to determine if there are bacteria present (normally, no bacteria should be present in the blood). The results of the blood culture can also help determine which antibiotic is best. The results of a blood culture are generally not available for 48 to 72 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture &ndash; During a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap, a clinician uses a needle to remove a sample of spinal fluid from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. Several tests are done on the fluid to determine if a bacterial infection is present, and if so, which antibiotic treatment is best.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The initial results are available within a matter of hours, but the bacterial culture usually takes 48 to 72 hours. If the signs, symptoms, season, or initial spinal fluid results suggest that the child may have viral meningitis, the spinal fluid may be sent for virologic studies, including viral cultures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular tests (called &quot;PCR&quot;) for enteroviruses, and other viruses. Viral cultures may take five or more days whereas the results of PCR tests may be available sooner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; In some cases, an imaging test such as a CT scan will be recommended before the lumbar puncture. The purpose of this test is to help determine if it is safe to perform the lumbar puncture and to determine if another condition may be contributing to the child's symptoms (eg, bleeding or a mass in the brain).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGITIS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment for meningitis depends upon whether the meningitis is caused by a virus or a bacterium. However, this distinction may not be clear until the culture results are available (usually 48 to 72 hours after they are obtained). In many cases, children are treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until bacterial meningitis is definitively excluded. The reason for this is that there is a significant risk of serious illness or even death if the child has bacterial meningitis and treatment is delayed for a prolonged period of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening illness that requires hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. The child will be monitored closely for signs of complications. Depending upon the severity of the illness, the child may also need supportive treatments to aid breathing, maintain blood pressure, prevent excessive bleeding, and keep the child hydrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with antibiotics is usually started immediately after the blood tests and lumbar puncture are performed. Treatment is administered intravenously. Oral antibiotics are not recommended. The concentration of antibiotics necessary to treat bacterial meningitis cannot be achieved with oral administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Length of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The length of antibiotic treatment depends upon the results of the bacterial cultures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cultures are negative and the child has improved, antibiotics may be discontinued after 48 to 72 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cultures are positive, the length of treatment depends upon the bacteria that is identified and whether there are complications. The treatment course may range from several days to several weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, there is no medication that can eliminate the virus causing viral meningitis. Instead, treatment is supportive, meaning that it is given to support the child while he or she recovers. This generally includes rest, encouraging the child to drink an adequate amount of fluid (when alert enough to do so), providing intravenous fluids (if unable to drink enough fluid), and medications to treat fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> headache (eg, acetaminophen or ibuprofen). These medications should be dosed according to weight, not age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGITIS PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child's prognosis after an episode of meningitis depends upon the cause (type of bacterium or virus), the severity of the illness, and the age of the child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A majority of children with bacterial meningitis recover completely with no long-term complications. The child should begin to improve within 24 to 36 hours after starting antibiotics. However, fever may persist for four to six days or longer.</p><p>However, even with proper treatment, meningitis can damage the brain and cause long-term complications, including deafness, developmental delay or learning disabilities, spastic or paralyzed muscles, and seizures. In developed countries such as the United States, approximately 15 percent of children with bacterial meningitis develop complications. Complications are more common in children who live in developing countries.</p><p>To determine if a child's hearing was affected by the illness, hearing testing is usually performed around the time of discharge from the hospital. Young children should also be monitored closely for signs of developmental delay (eg, not walking, talking, etc at expected time).</p><p>Bacterial meningitis is fatal in a small number of cases; between 2001 and 2006, approximately 4 percent of children in the United States with bacterial meningitis died.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with viral meningitis recover with no long-term complications. Symptoms usually begin to improve within one week, although some children will have fatigue, irritability, decreased concentration, muscle weakness and spasm, and difficulty with coordination for several weeks or more. Death is uncommon in children with viral meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MENINGITIS PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several measures can help to reduce the risk of developing bacterial and viral meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several routine childhood vaccines reduce the risk of developing bacterial meningitis, including the pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. These are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vaccines are also available to prevent certain types of viral infections that may cause meningitis or other central nervous system infections, including polio, influenza, varicella-zoster (chickenpox), measles, and mumps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive antibiotics are recommended for close contacts of anyone infected with meningococcal infection, even if the contact was previously vaccinated. Close contact is defined as a person who lives with the child or who spent &ge;4 hours with the child for at least five of the seven days before the child developed symptoms.</p><p>Preventive antibiotics may also be necessary for close contacts of anyone infected with Hib bacterial infection. However, this only applies for those households in which there is a person with invasive Hib disease and at least one household member who is a child younger than 48 months of age and did not receive all of the vaccinations against Hib or an individual who has a weakened immune system (even if that person was vaccinated against Hib).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Families of children with meningitis should take care to avoid becoming infected. This includes washing hands after touching the child or changing diapers and before eating or preparing food. Utensils and cups should not be shared, the child's mouth should be covered during a cough, and the child should not be kissed on the mouth. These measures should be continued until the child no longer has symptoms (eg, fever, diarrhea, rash).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any parent who suspects that their child could have meningitis should seek medical attention immediately.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of meningitis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborns may develop a fever accompanied by nonspecific symptoms (eg, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, rash).
