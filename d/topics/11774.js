In the blood vessel wall, basal and calcium-agonist stimulated release of NO largely accounts for the bioactivity of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the kidney, as well as other solid organs, physiologic concentrations of NO function as a tonic vasodilator, working essentially instantaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, higher concentrations can be toxic, damaging cellular constituents (such as DNA) and inducing hypotension in those with sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NO, a molecular gas, is formed by the action of one of three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The isoforms were named based upon the cell types in which they were first isolated: neuronal NOS (nNOS or NOS1); inducible or macrophage NOS (iNOS, NOS2); and endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. All three enzymes, which are cytochrome P450-like proteins, facilitate the addition of the guanidino nitrogen of the amino acid arginine to molecular oxygen, producing NO and water.</p><p>The expression of the three NOS isoforms differs, resulting in varying amounts of NO production. In general, eNOS and nNOS are constitutively active, producing relatively low levels of NO, with the output varying with changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. By comparison, the transcriptional regulation of iNOS can be markedly induced, particularly by inflammatory cytokines, resulting in extremely large amounts of NO.</p><p>NO is a paracrine mediator that works differently from endocrine mediators, such as angiotensin II and antidiuretic hormone. NO, which is produced and released by individual cells, readily penetrates the biological membranes of neighboring cells, modulating a number of signaling cascades. Since it has an extremely short half-life, it exerts its effects <strong>locally</strong> and <strong>transiently</strong>.</p><p>The most recognized cellular target of NO is heme-containing soluble guanylate cyclase. The stimulation of this compound enhances the synthesis of cyclic GMP (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP), increasing the cytosolic levels of cGMP. The effects of NO can be enhanced by inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP, a process catalyzed by a family of phosphodiesterases. Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase V are used clinically for erectile dysfunction and neonatal pulmonary hypertension, where they target nNOS and eNOS, respectively.</p><p>Other cellular targets for NO also exist:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NO interacts with thiol groups on proteins and small molecules, resulting in the formation of S-nitrosothiols. The addition and removal of S-nitrosothiols is a highly regulated process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NO can target <span class=\"nowrap\">Fe/S</span> groups at the catalytic centers of proteins, including hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The formation of peroxynitrite from NO and superoxide radical has been implicated in cellular toxicity via the propensity of peroxynitrite to induce posttranslational changes in the tyrosine residues of proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, the biologic effects of NO depend upon the concentration of NO produced as well as features specific to the local environment, particularly the presence and production of thiols and superoxide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Expression of nitric oxide in the kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All three NOS isoforms can be expressed in the kidney. The renal pattern of isoform expression (whether in normals or in certain disorders) may be clinically important as perturbations in NO bioactivity have been described in a number of kidney-dependent pathologic states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Inconsistencies and controversies concerning the expression of NOS isoforms are due in part to variations in the methods of <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> product being detected (such as mRNA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>nNOS is principally expressed in the macula densa and the inner medullary collecting duct</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although somewhat controversial, iNOS has been localized to several tubule segments (principally the thick medullary ascending limb but also the distal convoluted tubule and proximal tubule), glomerulus, and the interlobular and arcuate arteries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>eNOS is expressed in the endothelium of glomerular capillaries, afferent and efferent arterioles, and intrarenal arteries</p><p/><p>The greatest enzymatic activity for NO production in the kidney is found in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). IMCD NOS activity is three to sixfold higher than that observed in the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NITRIC OXIDE AND THE KIDNEY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insight into the role of NO in the kidney is primarily derived from experiments examining the altered expression of the NOS isoforms, the effects of inhibiting NOS (thereby lowering levels of NO), or the administration of NO donors. A large variety of actions on the kidney has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The most important of actions of NO in the kidney are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of renal hemodynamics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modulation of fluid and electrolyte transport</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of damage in response to injury</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal hemodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, eNOS is expressed to a variable extent in endothelial cells of the afferent arteriole, glomerulus, and efferent arteriole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Endothelial-derived NO plays a major role in maintaining arteriolar dilation by participating in the paracrine control of renal glomerular vascular resistance and mesangial cell tone. In the rat, acute systemic NOS inhibition causes marked increases in afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances and a fall in glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, chronic systemic blockade of NO bioactivity in rats induced by pharmacologic inhibition of NOS enzyme activity results in significant glomerular capillary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In these models, the marked increases in efferent arteriolar resistance also reflected important contributions from both angiotensin II and endothelin-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The systemic blood pressure is significantly affected by NO. In animal models, hypertension results from deletion of the genes for eNOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] or from chronic inhibition of NO synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>], while hypotension occurs in transgenic mice that overexpress eNOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. With inhibition of NO synthesis or deletion of eNOS genes, significant reductions in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate parallel the development of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p>In some clinical settings, enhanced eNOS activity may be deleterious; it may, for example, contribute to the renal vasodilation and glomerular hyperfiltration observed in diabetic nephropathy. In a diabetic rat model, enhanced glomerular filtration and renal plasma flow were blocked by the administration of a nonselective NOS blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Increased protein levels of eNOS, but not iNOS, were observed in the glomeruli of these animals, suggesting that the hemodynamic effects were due to enhanced eNOS activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Solute and water transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many renal responses to NOS blockade are mediated by actions on the microcirculation, NO also effects solute and water transport by directly altering the function of specific segments of the nephron. In particular, NO appears to play a role in the moment-to-moment homeostatic control of renal sodium excretion and extracellular fluid volume:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrarenal NO synthesis is increased during periods of increased salt intake, thereby facilitating renal sodium excretion. The administration of NO donors also augments sodium elimination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By comparison, acute or chronic blockade of NO synthesis (with NOS inhibitors) impairs urinary sodium excretion, even at concentrations that do not affect renal glomerular or systemic hemodynamics. As an example, chronic administration of a NOS inhibitor in humans results in a 40 percent reduction in the fractional excretion of sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, increased and decreased levels of NO enhance and impair the urinary excretion of sodium, respectively. This is due to effects on epithelial transporters located in specific nephronal segments. Specifically, NO inhibits sodium entry in the cortical collecting duct, Na-H exchange in the proximal tubule, the apical Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the outer medulla, and Na-K-ATPase activity in varied nephronal segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. NO also impairs the responsiveness of the collecting tubule to antidiuretic hormone, facilitating the excretion of water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Tubuloglomerular feedback</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the effects on NOS inhibition on body fluid homeostasis are thought to be mediated by changes in nNOS function expressed in the macula densa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. NO synthesized by nNOS in the macula densa <strong>blunts</strong> the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response in which increasing sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa lowers the glomerular filtration rate to maintain distal flow at a relatively constant level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73046 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>However, micropuncture experiments using NOS antagonists indicate that NO does not mediate TGF. Rather, NO release from the macula densa is a modulating factor that is augmented during increased sodium chloride delivery, thereby countering the afferent arteriole constriction elicited in the TGF response. Thus, changes in macula densa NO production may underlie the resetting of TGF that occurs when salt intake is varied; the response is appropriately blunted with a high-salt diet, as maintenance of glomerular filtration promotes excretion of the excess salt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Role in renal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of NO in the response to renal injury varies based upon the cell-type and NO isoform. The function of endothelial-derived NO as a tonic vasodilator as well as its ability to inhibit platelet activation and adhesion may help minimize injury in glomerulonephritis. This has been illustrated in mouse studies in which targeted inactivation of the eNOS gene increases the sensitivity to glomerular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/17,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31</a>].</p><p>However, NO generated by mesangial and tubular epithelial cells may exacerbate damage, due in part to the ability of these cells to induce the expression of iNOS in response to inflammatory stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Although mesangial cells do not express appreciable amounts of any of the NOS isoforms under basal conditions, they can be induced to express iNOS, a feature that has been documented in human glomerulonephritis, animal models of glomerular injury, and in vitro experiments using inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. As an example, exposure of mesangial cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) causes a 30-fold increase in cGMP content that is first evident at 8 hours and is maximal by 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>With inflammatory stimuli, increased levels of NO may enhance injury by suppressing eNOS (resulting in vasoconstriction) and directly causing epithelial cell damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nitric-oxide-and-the-kidney/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
