Obstructive coronary lesions are usually revascularized at the time of mitral valve surgery, since concurrent bypass surgery typically adds little morbidity or mortality to the procedure.

As an example, a report evaluated 124 patients with chronic MR, 94 with mitral valve prolapse; almost all patients were asymptomatic or had only a mild limitation in physical activity and the mean LVEF was 69 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Serum BNP values &ge;31 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> predicted lower five-year survival (72 versus 96 percent). BNP was independently predictive of mortality with adjustment for age, sex, functional class, MR severity, and LVEF. Thus, BNP level reflected the clinical consequences of MR rather than the severity of MR. Similarly, a study of 135 asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe primary MR and preserved LVEF found that BNP was an independent predictor of cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Surgery may be offered earlier in patients with borderline values in patients in whom access to such monitoring is limited. An occasional patient with a borderline LVEF or a technically limited study will require radionuclide, contrast angiography, or cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to assess LV function and regurgitant fraction. Exercise stress testing may add objective evidence about symptoms and a change in exercise tolerance; it may be particularly useful if a good history of exercise capacity is difficult to obtain.

If the ventricle is compensated and the heart rate is not excessive, the patient with atrial fibrillation merely notices palpitation. There is little or no disability in these cases except for an increased risk of stroke or other sign of systemic embolization. These patients are candidates for direct current cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm.

When the preoperative left atrial size exceeds 50 mm (by echocardiography), fewer than one-half of the patients return to normal sinus rhythm after surgery; in contrast, when left atrial dimension is normal, 85 percent of patients return to normal sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>These data and anecdotal clinical experience support the concept that, if postoperative atrial fibrillation and its complications are to be minimized, corrective surgery should be considered within months of the development of atrial fibrillation or before substantial left atrial enlargement is present. The 2014 and 2017 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines concluded that the weight of evidence was in favor of the efficacy of mitral valve surgery in asymptomatic patients with severe chronic MR and normal LV function who have new onset AF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98397 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Early and late survival rates are higher after mitral valve repair with aortic valve replacement than following double valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1727567606\"><span class=\"h4\">Effective regurgitant orifice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predictive value of a large ERO was suggested by a prospective observational study of 465 patients with isolated primary MR (80 percent mitral valve prolapse), a normal LVEF (mean 70 percent), absence of pulmonary hypertension, and, in all but 9 percent, absence of atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. An ERO &ge;40 mm<sup>2</sup>, which was present in 43 percent of cases, was associated with a significant increase in regurgitant volume (101 versus 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/beat</span> with an ERO &lt;20 mm<sup>2</sup>) and was a powerful predictor of an adverse outcome, including all-cause mortality, cardiac events, and undergoing cardiac surgery. </p><p>Similarly, a prospective observational study of 447 asymptomatic patients with severe MR and normal LV function found that ERO, baseline grade of pulmonary hypertension, and age were independent predictors for development of an indication for MV surgery or heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>A major limitation to the use of ERO is that quantitation of ERO is technically difficult and should only be performed in an experienced echocardiography laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Another key issue is that ERO does not account for the duration of regurgitation (mid-late systolic versus holosystolic), which likely explains why regurgitant volume rather than ERO predicted outcomes in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Eccentric MR jets are also more difficult to assess using echocardiographic measures. These issues are discussed in more detail separately.
