Patients are classified into one of five clinical subtypes (also called variants), which differ in clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82828\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82828 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mast cell leukemia (MCL)</p><p/><p>ISM and SSM usually have a clinically indolent course, with median survival measured in decades. In contrast, the other three subtypes have a more aggressive course, with median survival measured in months to years. As such, the term &quot;advanced mastocytosis&quot; is used to collectively refer to ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL. Patients with advanced forms of SM should be referred to centers with expertise in these disorders, when possible.</p><p>The evaluation to determine the category of SM is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-determining-the-subtype-of-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Determining the subtype of disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2136675563\"><span class=\"h2\">Indolent and smoldering subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) and smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM) account for approximately one-half of the cases of SM in published series. ISM carries a low-risk of progression to more severe forms of disease, while the risk with SSM is intermediate. (See <a href=\"#H2003537222\" class=\"local\">'Indolent systemic mastocytosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1383832889\" class=\"local\">'Smoldering systemic mastocytosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Morbidity in ISM and SSM is most commonly related to mast cell-mediator release, such as flushing, gastrointestinal disorders, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and anaphylaxis. Therefore, treatment of the clinically indolent SM subtypes is focused on preventing mast cell activation and minimizing the resulting symptoms when it does occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study, severe anaphylaxis was unexpectedly seen more in patients with ISM compared with those with more aggressive forms of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Additional therapies to reduce mast cell numbers can be associated with significant toxicity and are generally not indicated, except in rare cases when mast cell activation cannot be controlled by other means.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3050180185\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL have an aggressive clinical course with end-organ damage (eg, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, malabsorption, ascites, large osteolyses with or without pathologic fractures) and significantly shortened survival. Collectively, they are referred to as &quot;advanced systemic mastocytosis.&quot; Patients with advanced forms of SM should be referred to centers with expertise in these disorders (when possible) and often require cytoreductive therapy. However, they may also experience symptoms related to mast cell-mediator release.</p><p>There have been no randomized trials evaluating the treatment of patients with advanced SM. Data regarding treatment comes from case series or single-arm prospective trials. Cytoreductive therapies have demonstrated improvements in organ function, but impact on survival rates has been harder to estimate. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allogeneic HCT) offers the potential for cure in patients responding to therapy, although at a substantial risk of transplant-related mortality. Early referral for transplant evaluation is suggested to provide a risk-benefit assessment and allow for the early identification of a donor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with any form of systemic mastocytosis (SM) may experience episodic symptoms of mast cell activation, including apparent allergic reactions triggered by a variety of exposures. Up to one-half of adult patients with mastocytosis experience anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. All patients with SM should be educated about anaphylaxis and about how to avoid triggers for mast cell degranulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation for treating anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with SM should be educated about the management of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is more common in indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) and smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM) compared with advanced forms of the disease. Patients should be taught to lie flat if they experience lightheadedness or presyncope during symptomatic episodes. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> is the primary medical treatment for anaphylaxis. Patients should have at least two doses of epinephrine in a self-injectable form available at all times, since a single dose may be inadequate to counteract the massive release of mediators that can occur when patients with SM develop anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The treatment of anaphylaxis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mastocytosis patients should consider wearing a medical identification bracelet, especially if they have a history of anaphylaxis. In addition, patients can be equipped with an Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan or wallet card that identifies the condition and describes the proper treatment of anaphylaxis <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF+Documents/Libraries/Anaphylaxis-Emergency-Action-Plan.pdf&amp;token=/C5Q/iCB/2LLCwV7T8HK2lwm6sR/kEZoNaIqN/73HXSOVycSIPyputPn68SH00rxz4XgltVFJ9rSmMATkiTNtTCeVQHr44rjlSZkcJVXEDbh+x3d7qqBZUqDAak3uoXk/I0U9CKYd1MPL7MRKdB8kw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4787\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan - English)</a> <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF+Documents/Spanish/Anaphylaxis-Emergency-Action-Plan-Spanish.pdf&amp;token=Ls+BUTXwAuTJRkpRQ4LA1JgGv03onx4w09YFWrjDcTMb8nQK70M4sv3yKBB6Ojk/BSHuni4YwWs1wy9vgRTN0JU2OPH9WbcbiuH8WjlQ7CNVIxv/GWSD5R2OrOOaPAI/dBm3AtkXm1l5Bk3m72nDvg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4787\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan - Spanish)</a> <a href=\"http://www.aaaai.org/aaaai/media/medialibrary/pdf+documents/libraries/anaphylaxis-card.pdf&amp;token=c1Pc1g6Pa4YNwsJ13uqUlvUWoqekf1W6PaNksu7t1/vP0vk32tqalmKcffDuzoAx06SLuEfwXS0FLudPJh2kT9iZjmMFM6pZ+YGJ0UqllCNz1TlX4Nh7X+Gj6uiE92Lk&amp;TOPIC_ID=4787\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">(Anaphylaxis Emergency Action Plan - Wallet card)</a>.</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>If patients experience episodes of symptoms that resemble anaphylaxis, serum tryptase should be obtained (ideally between 15 minutes and 3 hours after the onset of symptoms). This can help determine, retrospectively, if the events were truly caused by mast cell-mediator release. If serum tryptase increases &ge;2 + 1.2 x baseline in the hours following <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms,</span> then those <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> can be attributed to mast cell activation. In rare instances, patients with SM can also suffer from panic attacks, and it is important to distinguish the two disorders so that effective treatment can be instituted for the panic disorder and overuse of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> can be avoided. However, it is important to realize the serum tryptase results will not be available immediately, and the emergency evaluations still rely on clinical judgment.</p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigger avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SM should be aware of the different triggers that can provoke mediator release from mast cells (eg, medications, medical procedures, and dietary factors that may precipitate symptoms). Of note, patients vary considerably in their sensitivity to specific triggers, so not all triggers are relevant to a given individual.</p><p>Possible triggers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to heat or cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute emotional stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very strenuous exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol and spicy foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], antibiotics)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthesia, surgery, and endoscopic procedures</p><p/><p>Insect stings (wasp, honey bee, and other Hymenoptera) can precipitate anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis, especially in those who have also developed immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated sensitization. Any patient with SM and systemic symptoms in response to a Hymenoptera sting should be tested for venom allergy, and those testing positive should be treated with venom immunotherapy (VIT) to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis upon subsequent stings. Patients with negative skin and blood tests should be retested in six months.

As a precaution, these medications should be avoided when possible, unless the patient's tolerance for a specific agent is already known. Problematic medications, as well as medications that are usually tolerated, are discussed separately.

If the patient had trouble tolerating the intervention, the medical records can help guide the selection of different perioperative drugs, and if the procedure was tolerated, the same medications could be used again.</p><p>We usually administer premedications prior to surgery (especially those that require general anesthesia), minor medical procedures, or the administration of radiocontrast dyes. Retrospective data support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Local and regional anesthesia are safer alternatives than general anesthesia. Local anesthetics are generally well-tolerated.

The largest retrospective series included 57 patients with systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN; 38 patients), mast cell leukemia (MCL; 12 patients), or aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM; 7 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Different types of donors and conditioning regimens were used. Overall, 70 percent of patients responded, as evidenced by improvements in the percentage of bone marrow mast cells, serum tryptase levels, or organ involvement. Nearly one-third demonstrated complete remission. Survival at three years was 74, 17, and 43 percent for SM-AHN, MCL, and ASM, respectively, which was significantly greater than historical controls, particularly for patients with SM-AHN. Myeloablative conditioning regimens were superior to reduced-intensity regimens.</p><p>Further studies are needed to better define the role of allogeneic HCT in SM, including the selection of patients, optimal timing in relation to other therapies, preferred debulking strategy prior to allogeneic HCT, and ideal conditioning regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H305988874\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF COEXISTENT ALLERGIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) develop allergic diseases at a rate similar to that of the general population and may experience anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera venom (honey bee, wasp, hornet, yellow jacket, or fire ant stings), as well as allergic rhinitis, asthma, food and drug allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>].

Thus, patients with anaphylaxis following a known or possible Hymenoptera sting should be evaluated with skin tests or in vitro tests for venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), and if found to be sensitized, they should be offered venom immunotherapy (VIT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of VIT in patients with SM appear to outweigh the risks of systemic allergic reactions to the therapy itself.

Twelve patients were re-stung during treatment, and nine of these developed only local reactions, suggesting protection against repeat anaphylaxis. However, adverse reactions during the build-up phase of immunotherapy were experienced by a large proportion of patients (30 percent). Patients should be counseled about this when giving consent to receive VIT. Most experts agree that the duration of VIT should be lifelong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Safety measures during administration of VIT include starting with a less concentrated venom preparation (ie, 0.01 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL)</span> and premedicating with an H1 antihistamine on the day of each injection.

Omalizumab was administered one week prior to his subsequent venom injection at a dose of twice what is generally indicated for the treatment of asthma. Using this approach before each monthly injection, he was able to advance immunotherapy to the effective dose. Subsequent attempts to lower the dose of omalizumab or to extend the time between maintenance injections beyond 30 days resulted in recurrent systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The patient sustained later Hymenoptera stings without reacting. However, another case report described a patient in whom omalizumab was administered to prevent systemic reactions to VIT, but the patient was not able to tolerate VIT once omalizumab was discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

In addition, one study indicated that some patients with ISM who initially presented with UP lesions may lose the UP lesions over time and have an excellent prognosis, even those who demonstrate the D816V mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/76,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,95</a>].</p><p>The presence of high-grade mast cell morphologic features, such as bilobed nuclei and significant hypogranulation, is usually associated with more serious forms of SM, such as ASM or MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Experimental evidence suggests that higher numbers of mast cell precursors in peripheral blood reflect aggressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].

Further study is warranted.</p><p>Mutations in the <em>TET2</em> (ten-eleven translocation 2) gene may be a marker of poor prognosis, as these mutations have been detected in advanced forms of mastocytosis, including SM-AHN and ASM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/99-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-102</a>]. Additional mutations in epigenetic transcriptional regulation genes DNA methyltransferase genes (<em>DNMT3A</em>), additional sex comb-like 1 (<em>ASXL1</em>), and in the proto-oncogene <em>CBL</em> have also been detected in patients with advanced disease and may indicate increased genomic instability and poorer prognosis. In patients with advanced SM, OS was significantly shorter in patients with additional molecular abnormalities besides <em>KIT</em> D816V [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. In particular, mutation of <em>SRSF2</em>, <em>ASXL1</em>, or <em>RUNX1</em> was associated with an adverse prognosis in patients with advanced SM, and overall survival (OS) was influenced by the number of mutated genes in this panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2715143012\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased risk for other disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a Danish registry of 687 adults with SM diagnosed between 1997 and 2012, patients were found to have an increased risk for several other disorders, compared with those without SM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

The subtypes are indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM), aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82828\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82828 \">table 1</a>). The clinical course of the different subtypes ranges from clinically indolent disorders with survival approaching that of the general population to aggressive diseases with survival measured in months to a year. (See <a href=\"#H3515008784\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with any form of SM may experience episodic symptoms of mast cell activation, including apparent allergic reactions triggered by a variety of exposures (eg, physical factors, alcohol, medications, emotional stress, and allergens). All patients should be equipped with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors, because up to half of individuals with SM experience anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ISM have a near-normal life expectancy, although a small number will evolve into more aggressive forms of SM. Patients with SSM are at higher risk for progression, although data are limited. Patients with these clinically indolent subtypes are particularly prone to anaphylaxis. Treatment should focus on preventing mast cell-mediator release and minimizing the resulting symptoms (eg, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neuropsychiatric symptoms).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatments include antihistamines, antileukotriene agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium, and other therapies for specific allergic conditions. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy for symptoms related to mast cell mediators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with Hymenoptera venom-induced anaphylaxis and positive skin tests or in vitro tests to venom, we suggest lifelong venom immunotherapy (VIT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3958736272\" class=\"local\">'Venom immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with ISM and SSM should be followed regularly with a review of systems and laboratory testing to detect signs and symptoms of disease progression. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are common complications, and screening, prevention, and treatment are important. (See <a href=\"#H2003537222\" class=\"local\">'Indolent systemic mastocytosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1383832889\" class=\"local\">'Smoldering systemic mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASM, SM-AHN, and MCL are collectively referred to as &quot;advanced SM&quot; because these disorders have an aggressive clinical course with end-organ damage (eg, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, malabsorption, ascites), leading to shortened survival. In addition to therapies aimed at preventing mast cell-mediator release, patients may benefit from cytoreductive therapies to reduce the tumor burden and improve organ function. (See <a href=\"#H1226266840\" class=\"local\">'Cytoreductive therapies for advanced disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of advanced SM has the goal of achieving a response and proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in transplant-eligible patients, as this approach offers the potential for cure (albeit with a substantial risk of transplant-related mortality). (See <a href=\"#H2304956361\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with advanced SM, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midostaurin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midostaurin</a>, rather than other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), interferon-alfa (IFN-alfa), or other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This suggestion applies to patients with advanced SM, regardless of <em>KIT</em> mutational status (ie, wild type, mutant, or <em>KIT</em> status unknown). (See <a href=\"#H1143078398\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The only exceptions to the suggestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midostaurin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midostaurin</a> as initial cytoreductive therapy in advanced SM are those patients with SM associated with chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) or with well-differentiated advanced SM, for whom <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> or other cytoreductive treatments may be acceptable alternatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The choice of initial cytoreductive therapy may also be influenced by toxicity profile <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tempo of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SM-AHN should be treated for the disease component that is felt to be contributing to the major current clinical concerns. Prognosis often relates to the associated hematologic neoplasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Allogeneic HCT should be considered in selected patients whose associated hematologic disorder constitutes an indication for this procedure and for those with rapidly progressive SM. (See <a href=\"#H1837412757\" class=\"local\">'Systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MCL have poor long-term prognosis. Allogeneic HCT may offer the only curative option, although response rates are low. (See <a href=\"#H2207896761\" class=\"local\">'Mast cell leukemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment options as a bridge to allogeneic HCT include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midostaurin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midostaurin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cladribine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cladribine</a>, or combination chemotherapy regimens, similar to those with acute myeloid leukemia. Less aggressive variants of MCL may respond to treatment with TKIs or cladribine.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1639458151\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Mariana C Castells, MD, PhD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Worobec AS.
