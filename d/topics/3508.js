Medical therapy is not curative and its effects are relatively modest; therefore, it is indicated in only a few situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-medical-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy remains the mainstay of therapy for CTEPH.</p><p>The indications, outcomes, and approach to treatment with medical therapy are reviewed here. The general approach to the treatment of CTEPH, including general measures such as anticoagulation, and surgical measures such as pulmonary thromboendarterectomy and pulmonary balloon angioplasty are described separately.

Thus, there are only a few clinical situations in which medical therapy may be indicated: patients who are not operative candidates; patients who have a suboptimal hemodynamic and functional outcome following pulmonary thromboendarterectomy or balloon pulmonary angioplasty; and as a bridge to definitive surgical intervention in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-thromboembolic-pulmonary-hypertension-medical-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Inoperable and persistent CTEPH are the two most common indications for medical therapy that have stronger evidence to support its efficacy. The use of medical therapy as a bridge to surgery is based upon small observational series and clinical experience.</p><p>Medications used to treat CTEPH are those that are used to treat idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

(See <a href=\"#H1662726\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery (pulmonary thromboendarterectomy) is the only potentially curative therapy for CTEPH. Percutaneous pulmonary balloon angioplasty appears to have a potential role in selected patients with inoperable CTEPH. Medical therapy has hemodynamic and symptomatic benefits, but these benefits are modest compared to those that can be achieved with surgery. Thus, medical therapy is indicated in few clinical situations: patients who are not operative candidates, patients who have a suboptimal hemodynamic and functional outcome following pulmonary thromboendarterectomy; as a bridge to definitive surgical intervention in patients with severe or immediately life-threatening pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H1663229\" class=\"local\">'Indications and Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CTEPH in whom the decision has been made to use medical therapy, agent selection is generally based upon factors including patient preference, cost, availability, safety, route of administration, and functional class (World Health Organization [WHO] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 3</a>) or New York Heart Association [NYHA] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62080 \">table 2</a>)).
