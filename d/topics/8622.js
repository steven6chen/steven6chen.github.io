However, clinical suspicion or a risk factor for CHD must be identified to prompt referral for fetal echocardiography. Routine antenatal ultrasound traditionally included assessment of the fetal heart using the four chamber view; however, the practice guidelines of the International Society for Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) published in 2013 now recommend expanded views for screening, including assessment of the outflow tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Studies performed in the era prior to publication of these guidelines indicate that less than half of patients with critical congenital heart defects were routinely identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease/abstract/10,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,42-44</a>].

However, if there is significant obstruction at the atrial communication, systemic perfusion will be impaired as all pulmonary venous return must traverse the atrial communication to reach the left heart and supply the systemic circulation. This is the rare instance when these lesions might benefit from ductal patency (ie, prostaglandin therapy) until urgent surgical intervention can be achieved. If obstruction occurs within the pulmonary venous pathway itself, such as occurs commonly in TAPVR below the diaphragm, ductal patency is not of utility and the only effective management strategy is urgent surgical intervention.
