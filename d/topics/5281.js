Infection in humans most commonly occurs through the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat that contains tissue cysts, through ingestion of water or food contaminated with oocysts, or congenitally through transplacental transmission from a mother who acquired infection during pregnancy. Transmission has also been reported through solid organ transplantation.</p><p>Laboratory testing is usually necessary to establish the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis because the clinical manifestations of infection are so protean. The diagnostic methodology requires careful consideration based on the patient&rsquo;s clinical presentation. Available diagnostic modalities for <em>T. gondii</em> include serologic assays, molecular-based techniques (eg, polymerase chain reaction-based assays), and histopathology.</p><p>This topic will address diagnostic techniques for toxoplasmosis in the immunocompetent and immunocompromised adult.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For immunocompetent patients with suspected acute infection, including pregnant women, serologic testing is typically used as the initial diagnostic step. For pregnant women, the use of reference laboratories and additional testing methods are often needed to avoid delays in diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H5237544\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2327541063\" class=\"local\">'Considerations in pregnant women'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with chorioretinitis, serology or aqueous humor analysis can be used to support the diagnosis.

However, in some cases, a presumptive diagnosis is made based upon the clinical presentation, and empiric treatment is administered. For such patients, response to therapy is supportive of the diagnosis.

The clinical manifestations of acute infection are described in detail elsewhere.

The IgM titer subsequently declines and disappears, but the rate of decline is highly variable from individual to individual, and in some patients, may take months or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgG antibodies subsequently follow within approximately two weeks of primary infection, peak within approximately eight weeks, and generally persist for life. There is no direct correlation between the height of the IgG titer and the proximity of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308280844\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are typically used for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) tests can also be used, but are much less common. Some of these tests are available commercially, while others are only available in specialized research laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/1,3-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-13</a>]. The performance of these tests varies. As an example, one study of six different IgG ELISA test kits found that the sensitivity ranged from 93 to 100 percent and the specificity ranged from 78 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The Sabin-Feldman dye test, which only detects IgG antibody, was the reference gold standard for testing blood or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) since 1948, but is now only available in certain reference laboratories, such as the Palo Alto Foundation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10843435\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation of initial results</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonreactive IgM</strong> &ndash; Acute toxoplasmosis is highly unlikely in a patient with signs of cervical lymphadenopathy who has a negative <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgM antibody. However, if the test was obtained within one week of developing symptoms, and clinical suspicion remains high, the IgM should be repeated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">False-negative serologic testing occurs rarely, and is typically seen in patients who have a primary immunodeficiency such as hypogammaglobulinemia, or among those who are significantly immunocompromised (eg, transplant patients, especially bone marrow transplants, or those with HIV infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reactive IgM and nonreactive IgG</strong> &ndash; In a patient with signs and symptoms of primary toxoplasmosis, a reactive <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgM antibody paired with a nonreactive IgG antibody is suggestive of acute infection. The diagnostic certainty increases if repeat testing demonstrates the appearance of <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgG antibody. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, if the IgM antibody is positive two to three weeks later, but the IgG antibody remains negative, the initial IgM may be a false-positive. False-positive IgM antibody results are a significant issue in serologic testing for toxoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A false-positive IgM test result may be related to rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and nonspecific binding in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In settings where it is important to determine if the IgM is a true or false-positive result (eg, pregnancy), an IgM capture ELISA or IgM immunosorbent agglutination assay (ISAGA) should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1073626670\" class=\"local\">'Confirmatory IgM testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reactive IgM and reactive IgG</strong> &ndash; In patients with acute infection, it is common to see a positive result for both IgM and IgG antibodies since the IgG antibody rises quickly after primary infection. However, clinicians should be aware that IgM antibodies can persist for months (or years) after primary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, a reactive IgM antibody test for toxoplasmosis must always be interpreted within the clinical context. Diagnostic confirmation can be pursued with an alternative method of diagnostic testing, such as avidity testing, especially if it is important to understand when the infection occurred (eg, pregnant women). (See <a href=\"#H1207145758\" class=\"local\">'Avidity testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1688715067\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional testing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1073626670\"><span class=\"h4\">Confirmatory IgM testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing can be performed to confirm acute infection in patients with a positive IgM serology for toxoplasmosis if two samples taken two weeks apart do not confirm or refute acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10843435\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of initial results'</a> above.)</p><p>For such patients, a confirmatory IgM capture ELISA or an IgM ISAGA can be performed since these tests are sensitive and specific for <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgM antibodies.

Avidity is measured by exposing an antigen-antibody complex to reagents that can lead to dissociation of the specific <em>Toxoplasma</em> IgG antibody from its antigen.</p><p>A high antibody avidity is seen during infection that is greater than four months old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/13,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20,21</a>]. Thus, acute toxoplasmosis would be unlikely in an immunocompetent host with cervical lymphadenopathy and a high avidity test. In a comparative trial of four commercially available assays, the positive predictive value of a high-avidity result was 100 percent for latent infection versus acute disease (within four months) in immunocompetent, untreated individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Low-avidity tests are less useful diagnostically. Although a low antibody avidity is typically seen in patients with recent infection (often within four months), in some cases low-avidity antibodies can persist for months. Thus, in situations where therapeutic decisions depend upon dating the infection (eg, pregnancy), a low-avidity antibody test is not diagnostic of acute disease without further testing (eg, agglutination assays <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specific immunoglobulin tests) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Various antibodies to <em>T. gondii</em> react differently when two different fixatives (eg, acetone and formalin) are used to fix the parasites. These properties have been used to differentiate antibodies that are formed either acutely or later in infection. For example, early antibodies react to acetone-fixed parasites, while antibodies that develop later in infection react to formalin-fixed parasites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1451662449\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactivation infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients with suspected reactivation disease, serum IgM antibodies are usually absent and serum IgG antibodies present.

In addition, although central nervous system infection may be suggested by intrathecally produced IgG or IgM, CSF antibody tests can be confounded by contamination of the CSF by serum during the lumbar puncture, or passive transfer of antibody from the blood. </p><p>More detailed discussions of how to diagnose toxoplasmosis in patients with presumed reactivation disease are presented elsewhere.

The specific panel depends upon the gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women &le;16 weeks, the testing panel includes the <em>Toxoplasma</em> IgG dye test, the <em>Toxoplasma</em> IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the <em>Toxoplasma</em> IgG avidity test. Avidity testing is used in this setting since a high avidity test is seen during infection that is greater than four months old (ie, it can exclude infection acquired during pregnancy or close to conception). (See <a href=\"#H1207145758\" class=\"local\">'Avidity testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women &gt;16 weeks gestational age, the panel includes the <em>Toxoplasma</em> IgG dye test, the <em>Toxoplasma</em> IgM ELISA, and the differential agglutination test (also known as the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;AC/HS</span> test&quot;). An acute <span class=\"nowrap\">AC/HS</span> typically indicates infection acquired &lt;12 months from the time of testing, and a nonacute <span class=\"nowrap\">AC/HS</span> indicates infection acquired &ge;12 months from the time of testing (ie, infection was acquired before conception). (See <a href=\"#H253179725\" class=\"local\">'Agglutination assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>If initial testing is sent to a commercial laboratory, confirmatory testing should be sent to a reference laboratory if the IgM is positive or equivocal (regardless of the IgG). If the IgM is negative and the IgG is positive, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that confirmatory testing be performed in women &gt;20 weeks gestation or if there is a high clinical suspicion of congenital toxoplasmosis (ie, abnormal ultrasound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Outside of the United States, other serologic testing panels may be used. As an example, a standard ELISA-IgG test may be performed as part of the initial testing panel rather than a dye test, and an IgG-avidity assay (rather than the <span class=\"nowrap\">AC/HS</span> test) may be used even in women &gt;16 weeks gestation. </p><p>Information on testing for fetal infection is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Fetal infection'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5238681\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>. Laboratory testing is usually necessary to establish the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis because the clinical manifestations of infection are so protean. (See <a href=\"#H13029269\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>T. gondii</em> infection can be diagnosed indirectly with serologic testing (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays). In acute infection, <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgM antibodies usually appear within one week and continue to rise. The IgM titer subsequently declines and disappears, but the rate of decline is highly variable. <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgG antibodies subsequently follow within approximately two weeks of primary infection, peak within approximately eight weeks, and generally persist for life. (See <a href=\"#H29313912\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosing acute infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with symptoms and signs of primary toxoplasmosis, acute toxoplasmosis is unlikely in the setting of a negative <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgM. By contrast, a reactive <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgM antibody paired with a nonreactive IgG antibody would be suggestive of acute infection. The diagnostic certainty increases if repeat testing demonstrates the appearance of <em>Toxoplasma</em>-specific IgG antibody, since false-positive IgM tests can occur. (See <a href=\"#H10843435\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of initial results'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1073626670\" class=\"local\">'Confirmatory IgM testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In clinical practice, a positive result for both IgM and IgG antibodies can be seen in the setting of acute infection. However, clinicians should be aware that IgM antibodies can persist for months (or years) after primary infection. Thus, a reactive IgM antibody test for toxoplasmosis must always be interpreted within the clinical context. An assessment of the IgG antibody &quot;avidity pattern&quot; can be performed to help discriminate recently acquired IgG antibodies from antibodies formed in the past. (See <a href=\"#H10843435\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of initial results'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1207145758\" class=\"local\">'Avidity testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected reactivation disease typically have IgG antibodies present, although additional testing (eg, polymerase chain reaction testing, histopathology) may be needed to establish the diagnosis since a positive serum IgG alone cannot distinguish active from past infection. In addition, the absence of antibodies in immunocompromised patients does not completely exclude the possibility of reactivation disease. (See <a href=\"#H1451662449\" class=\"local\">'Reactivation infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can be a helpful aid in diagnosing toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised hosts with suspected disseminated disease, or in patients with ocular disease. However, PCR is rarely performed in immunocompetent patients presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H10843290\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Toxoplasma</em> may be detected on histopathology in one of two forms: tachyzoites or cysts. Tachyzoites are crescent-shaped and usually establish the diagnosis of acute infection. Cysts are circular in shape and may represent latent infection or reactivation disease, depending on the host. (See <a href=\"#H5237302\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The key diagnostic consideration in pregnant women is to determine whether acute infection occurred during pregnancy and, therefore, could have been transmitted to the fetus. (See <a href=\"#H2327541063\" class=\"local\">'Considerations in pregnant women'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-testing-for-toxoplasmosis-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Montoya JG, Remington JS.
