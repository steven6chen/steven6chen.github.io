One cause is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with defective DNA repair mechanisms: ataxia-telangiectasia (AT; MIM 208900). Patients with AT develop progressive cerebellar ataxia, abnormal eye movements, other neurologic abnormalities, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, and immune deficiency.</p><p>This topic will review the genetics and clinical aspects of AT. A closely related disorder, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD), is also discussed in this review. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder'</a> below.)</p><p>The hereditary ataxias are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hereditary ataxias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The defective gene in AT has been mapped to chromosome 11q22.3, and designated the ATM gene (for AT Mutated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The ATM gene product has one region similar to that of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinases and another region similar to DNA <span class=\"nowrap\">repair/cell</span> checkpoint genes. It is expressed in all tissues in the body.</p><p>ATM is involved in the detection of DNA damage, and plays an important role in cell cycle progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The latter function is exerted at the transition between the G1 and S phase, when a cell initiates DNA synthesis in preparation for DNA replication. It also functions at the G2 to M transition, during which the cell begins to divide.</p><p>Thus, the ATM kinase appears to be involved in a surveillance mechanism that, in the presence of DNA damage, will stall progression of the cell cycle. This delay allows the cell to repair the damage, rather than passing on damaged genetic information to daughter cells.</p><p>Our understanding of how the ATM kinase acts is increasing. In the presence of DNA damage, the ATM kinase phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein p53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Phosphorylated p53 serves as a transcriptional activator of genes that cause cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In the absence of ATM kinase, p53 does not become phosphorylated and cannot prevent the cell from moving into the next phase of the cell cycle.</p><p>ATM also phosphorylates other proteins:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tumor suppressor BRCA1, which is one of the genes implicated in breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This interaction may explain (at least in part) how inheriting a mutant ATM protein might predispose patients with AT as well as heterozygotes to breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Heterozygotes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The c-abl tyrosine kinase and the nibrin protein, which also are involved in DNA repair, primarily in response to ionizing radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The Nijmegen breakage syndrome is an immunodeficiency disorder that is caused by mutations in the NBN gene that encodes nibrin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nijmegen-breakage-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nijmegen breakage syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eIF-4E-binding protein 1, which releases the translation initiation factor, eIF-4E, and stimulates protein synthesis in the presence of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This interaction may explain the poor growth and insulin resistance that are seen in patients with AT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein phosphatase 2A, which regulates the nuclear importation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Hypophosphorylated HDAC4 translocates to the nucleus of neurons in ATM-deficient mice, resulting in histone deacetylation, altered neuronal gene expression, and neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>In the absence of the supervisory function of ATM, cells can build up somatic mutations, possibly leading to malignant transformation. The increased propensity for leukemias and lymphomas in AT may be related to the remarkable number of chromosomal translocations and inversions in lymphocytes that result from the DNA processing defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These abnormalities predominantly involve the gene loci that generate mature immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes via genetic rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The defect in nuclear DNA repair in AT also explains the sensitivity of cells to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17,18</a>]. Mouse models of AT display many of the features of human disease, including growth retardation, immune system defects, and sensitivity to radiation, although they do not display some of the other features, such as the progressive ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>In some heterozygotes, specific missense mutations result in an abnormal protein (instead of producing no detectable ATM kinase, as is the case with null or truncating mutations), which acts by dominantly interfering with the function of the product of the normal allele (a dominant negative effect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This is proposed to account for the increased risk of solid tumors that is seen in these particular ATM heterozygotes. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Heterozygotes'</a> below.)</p><p>Another possible role for ATM is the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], in part via regulation of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), which is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. RR activity and dNTP synthesis are an important part of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and repair pathway. Experimental evidence suggests that ATM and RR normally regulate proper mtDNA copy number and expression, and that mutant ATM results in reduced RR activity or expression. This causes mtDNA depletion and disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Impaired mitochondrial activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of AT, leading to clinical features such as ataxia, neurodegeneration, and premature aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both the central and peripheral nervous systems are involved in AT. The central nervous system abnormalities are more severe and are primarily characterized by cerebellar atrophy with particular loss of Purkinje cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Histologic examination of the peripheral nerves reveals malformed nuclei in Schwann cells. The thymus usually is hypoplastic, with fewer lymphocytes and absence of Hassall corpuscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; these findings are consistent with the associated immune deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated incidence of AT is 1 in 20,000 to 100,000 live births. However, as many as 1.4 to 2.0 percent of Caucasians in the United States carry one defective AT gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with AT who are homozygotes invariably suffer from progressive cerebellar ataxia, abnormal eye movements, other neurologic abnormalities, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, and immune deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. Associated features include pulmonary disease, an increased incidence of malignancy, radiation sensitivity, growth retardation, and diabetes mellitus caused by insulin resistance. Each of these abnormalities presumably results from impaired protein function induced by the mutation in the ATM gene. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ataxia is the earliest clinical manifestation of AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Many children appear healthy for the first year of life and begin walking at a normal age, but are slow to develop fluidity of gait. Other children will manifest ataxia in infancy and walking will be delayed. Affected children also have difficulty standing still without wobbling. Unlike most ataxic disorders, individuals with AT walk on an unusually narrow base, and young children often prefer to walk quickly or run. However, they fall less frequently than one might expect. Gross motor function remains abnormal but relatively stable until school age, and the condition may be misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy rather than AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Thereafter, gross and fine motor skills deteriorate, leading to reconsideration of the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. At about the same time, children develop dysarthria and complex disorders of movement. By the second decade of life, most patients must rely on wheelchairs for mobility outside the home.</p><p>Eye movements are often normal in preschoolers, but children later develop abnormalities of both voluntary and involuntary saccades and have difficulty moving their eyes and heads in smooth, coordinated pursuit of a moving target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In addition, there is delay in initiating eye movement, and the eyes move in a series of small jumps rather than in a single smooth motion.</p><p>The most obvious early manifestation is oculomotor apraxia: the inability to coordinate head and eye movements naturally when shifting gaze rapidly (saccadic eye movements). The early eye movement control problems are primarily related to impaired saccadic initiation, saccadic hypometria, abnormal smooth pursuit, and difficulty suppressing the vestibulo-ocular reflex while tracking an object moving with head rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Visual performance progressively deteriorates, with signs that include periodic alternating nystagmus and impaired lateral end-gaze fixation, vertical gaze holding, and velocity storage. By the end of their first decade of life, most children with AT stop reading longer passages for content because of these difficulties, even though they are easily able to identify single words and short phrases. Acquired strabismus is also common.</p><p>Mild to moderate cognitive impairment is frequently present early in the course of AT, and cognitive deficits may become more widespread and severe in the later stages of AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The majority of children with AT never attain normal speech due to problems with articulation, and speech further deteriorates after the age of five to eight years. There is a characteristic delay in the initiation of speech, and the speech is typically slow with inappropriate emphasis placed on single words or syllables. Progressive difficulty with chewing and swallowing develops over time, and aspiration is common in individuals over the age of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Despite the obvious cerebellar pathology, many of the motor difficulties of AT are extrapyramidal in nature (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Variant AT'</a> below). These include dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, chorea, delayed reaction time, facial hypomimia, and distal adventitious movements at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/28,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,41</a>]. Peripheral axonal neuropathy is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. However, neuropathy contributes relatively little to functional impairment in AT given the severity of other movement deficits.</p><p>In some cases, patients with AT develop a distally predominant pattern of lower motor neuron weakness due to anterior horn cell degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], though this may be difficult to distinguish from a mixed motor-sensory axonal neuropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Telangiectasias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Telangiectasias of blood vessels are seen primarily on the bulbar conjunctivae and on exposed areas of the skin, typically the pinnae, nose, face, and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In most cases, they first appear when the child reaches three to five years of age. It is perhaps unfortunate that this disease is named ataxia-telangiectasia because the delayed appearance of telangiectasia often results in delayed diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13266060\"><span class=\"h2\">Other dermatologic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with AT frequently have caf&eacute;-au-lait macules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Additional skin lesions that occur with AT include hypopigmented macules, melanocytic nevi, and facial papulosquamous rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune deficiency, affecting both cellular and humoral immunity, occurs in approximately 70 percent of patients. The defect is quite variable but often manifests as recurrent sinopulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Infections outside of the respiratory tract are generally not increased in frequency, and opportunistic infections rarely occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Infections may be the result of underlying immunodeficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysfunctional swallow with aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11399544\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive pulmonary disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Three major types of pulmonary involvement are associated with AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent sinopulmonary infections and bronchiectasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial lung <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/pulmonary</span> fibrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular abnormalities, including dysphagia, aspiration, and respiratory muscle weakness</p><p/><p>Even in the absence of infection, patients with AT can develop interstitial lung disease, with symptoms including nonproductive cough, dyspnea, fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and crackles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Many children with AT have difficulty with coordination of swallowing and may aspirate foods, liquids, and oral secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/40,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,50</a>]. Dysphagia often presents in the second decade of life. Furthermore, neuromuscular weakness can result in decreased tidal volumes and ineffective cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beyond age 10 years, the incidence of cancer in AT is 1 percent per year; overall, approximately 10 to 25 percent of patients will develop malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. Of these neoplasms, 85 percent are lymphomas and acute leukemias, but a predisposition to other cancers (such as breast cancer) may also exist.</p><p>AT cells are susceptible to damage by ionizing radiation, or chemotherapeutic agents that cause double-stranded breaks in DNA. Deaths caused by extreme sensitivity to chemotherapy for malignancy have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], and the incidence of late complications following radiation therapy may be higher in some affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most consistent laboratory abnormality is an elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in children over the age of eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The level does not necessarily rise over time, and does not correlate with severity of disease.</p><p>There is a wide range of laboratory abnormalities involving both humoral and cell-mediated immunity among individuals with AT. However, it should be stressed that despite the high frequency of laboratory abnormalities, there is a striking lack of opportunistic infections and the risk for infection has never been closely correlated with any single or group of laboratory abnormalities. The abnormalities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin deficiency, especially absence or marked reduction of IgA, IgG2, and other IgG subclasses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclass-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclass deficiency&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to produce antibodies to polysaccharide antigens such as those forming the capsule of pathogenic bacteria such as the pneumococcus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoclonal gammopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphopenia with the most prominent reduction in T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]</p><p/><p>Occasional patients have severe panhypogammaglobulinemia or present with a picture compatible with severe combined immunodeficiency disease. In the vast majority of AT patients, immunodeficiency is not progressive, but humoral immune deficiency becomes more severe with increasing age in 5 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Spontaneous cytogenetic abnormalities, including chromatid gaps, chromosomal breakage, translocations, and rearrangements are common, especially involving the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene loci on chromosomes 7 and 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Variant AT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is mounting evidence describing a phenotype of &quot;variant ataxia-telangiectasia&quot; (variant AT) that has a milder course than classic AT, perhaps on the basis of mutations that result in expression of residual ATM protein and kinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/41,68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,68-71</a>]. The most common presenting or predominant features are movement disorders such as tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, and choreoathetosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 13 patients with variant AT, typical clinical manifestations were childhood onset of extrapyramidal symptoms and signs, mainly choreoathetosis or rest tremor, followed a few years later by cerebellar ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Axonal neuropathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower motor neuron weakness were additional features. All patients had elevated serum alpha fetoprotein.

Some of the subjects had myoclonus, whereas none had prominent ocular telangiectasia, oculomotor apraxia, or ataxia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study identified pathogenic ATM mutations in three members of a Muslim Indian family who presented with cervical dopa-responsive dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia#H3959000\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;, section on 'Dopa-responsive dystonia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Heterozygotes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, up to 2 percent of Caucasians in the United States carry one defective AT gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>]. Heterozygotes have none of the classical clinical manifestations of AT. However, they may have a higher incidence of malignancy at a younger age, and perhaps coronary heart disease. In one retrospective cohort study of 405 grandparents of patients with AT, carriers died on average seven to eight years earlier than did noncarriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Most of the excess deaths were caused by cancer, and a trend toward increased mortality caused by coronary heart disease was found. Compared with noncarriers, carriers who died of coronary disease were 11 years younger.</p><p>The spectrum of malignancies observed in blood relatives is quite different from that of people with AT, being much more heavily weighted toward solid tumors. Among the cancers associated with AT heterozygosity, the most significant relative risks are observed for female breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/7-9,53,75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,53,75-77</a>].</p><p>The relationship between heterozygosity for ATM mutation and breast cancer risk has been controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Early studies were limited by a lack of a reliable assay that could identify carriers. After the gene was identified in 1995, a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (two- to fivefold) was identified in many but not all studies of carriers among AT families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/8-10,76,77,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,76,77,79</a>]. However, when screening for truncating mutations that characterize 60 to 70 percent of AT homozygotes was extended to large cohorts of people with breast cancer, an excess of truncating mutations could not be demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>One explanation for these disparate results (and for the different cancer phenotypes that characterize AT heterozygotes versus homozygotes) may be that heterozygotes that have missense mutations of ATM (in particular, ones that do not cause AT) could predispose to breast cancer by a different mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/21,81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,81,82</a>]. These variants, instead of producing no detectable ATM kinase (as is the case with null or truncating mutations), result in an abnormal protein that acts by dominantly interfering with the function of the normal allele (a dominant negative effect). In fact, putative missense mutations have been reported in a number of studies of breast cancer populations where ATM truncating mutations have not been found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/80,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,83</a>].</p><p>Another explanation is that only a subset of ATM mutations, defined by biological characteristics, confers a risk of breast cancer, although the mutations are not as highly penetrant for breast cancer as are BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/77,82,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,82,84</a>]. As an example, a clear association between truncating ATM mutations and breast cancer risk was shown in a report using index cases from families with at least three breast cancers in which BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Nine ATM mutations predicted to result in premature truncation or exon skipping were identified in 443 familial breast cancer cases (2 percent compared with 0.4 percent of 521 controls). In all, there were 12 ATM mutations (truncating, splicing, or missense) in cases compared with two in controls. The relative risk of breast cancer associated with ATM mutations was estimated to be 2.37 (an estimate which is consistent with studies of AT families), and equivalent to a breast cancer attributable fraction of 0.86 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, taken together, the available evidence suggests that there is an approximately twofold increase in the risk of breast cancer associated with heterozygosity for ATM mutations that cause AT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Criteria have been proposed to establish the diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57053\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57053 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The diagnosis is established by the presence of characteristic clinical findings (particularly progressive cerebellar ataxia) and identification of disabling mutations on both alleles for the AT mutated gene (ATM). It is supported by serum IgA at least two standard deviations below normal for age and by increased spontaneous and radiation-induced chromosome fragility in cultured cells.</p><p>In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of a serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at least two standard deviations above normal for age is diagnostic of the disorder, with a sensitivity of approximately 95 percent. In patients older than six months of age, an AFP concentration &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is be considered abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. It should be remembered that telangiectasia usually appears after age five years and that not all patients with AT have elevated levels of AFP.</p><p>Another diagnostic method involves a rapid immunoblotting assay for ATM protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], which is severely depleted in most patients with AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/29,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,88</a>]. However, this procedure requires a large blood sample and is available in few laboratories.</p><p>Since T cell lymphopenia may be associated with AT, newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID) using T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) quantification may also identify some infants with non-SCID immunodeficiencies such as AT. Not all infants with AT will be detected by TREC screening, but the TREC test will flag those who have a profound decrease in circulating na&iuml;ve T cells.

If ataxia develops early, it may be misdiagnosed as an ataxic variety of cerebral palsy, particularly because mental retardation is not a feature. When the onset is delayed, AT most often is mistaken for Friedreich ataxia, a disorder that now is diagnosed by genetic testing for mutation in the frataxin gene.

No disease-modifying treatment exists for the ataxic syndrome or the progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration. Many patients with AT succumb to progressive pulmonary disease caused by repeated infection or to cancer, and the median age at death is approximately 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Presently no therapies significantly alter the course of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11401238\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Current management strategies for patients with AT are based upon the treatment of disease manifestations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute infection should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and simple maneuvers such as postural drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections. Chest clearance techniques may be helpful in patients with acute or chronic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of glucocorticoid therapy is an option for patients who have interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, only limited observational data support any benefit of this treatment for patients with AT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Other sparse data, including a randomized controlled trial with 13 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>] and a case series of 6 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>], indicate that short-term treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> may help improve ataxia in patients with AT. Regardless of whether glucocorticoid treatment is directed at interstitial lung disease or ataxia, the optimal dosing regimens and duration of therapy in AT are unknown, as is the safety of long-term treatment. Glucocorticoids can lead to a clinically significant increased risk of infection and insulin resistance in patients with AT and should therefore be used cautiously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic lung disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AT (see <a href=\"#H11399544\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary disease'</a> above).

Every attempt should be made to test pulmonary function in children with AT who develop chronic respiratory tract symptoms. Pulmonary function should also be part of the risk assessment for elective surgery for patients with AT who are age 10 years and older. Some experts advise regular assessment of lung function in all symptomatic and asymptomatic children with AT who are old enough to cooperate with testing, including yearly spirometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ataxia-telangiectasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early detection of pulmonary structural damage, particularly bronchiectasis and consolidation, is valuable, resulting in more intensive care and prompt start of treatment.

In a study of 15 patients with AT, MRI identified lung abnormalities in all cases, including 7 patients without respiratory symptoms.
