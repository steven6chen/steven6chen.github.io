Although swelling resolves spontaneously in two to four days in the absence of treatment, laryngeal edema may cause fatal asphyxiation, and the pain of gastrointestinal attacks may be incapacitating or lead to unnecessary abdominal surgery. The most common forms of HAE (types I and II) are caused by deficiency or dysfunction in C1 inhibitor (C1INH-HAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are other forms of the disorder in which C1INH is normal called hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE with normal C1INH), which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation and treatment of acute attacks of HAE in adults and children will be reviewed here. Other aspects of these conditions are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: General care and long-term prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92104744\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attacks of HAE are commonly categorized as laryngeal, gastrointestinal, or cutaneous. Laryngeal attacks are the least common but most dangerous type of attack because airway obstruction can progress to asphyxiation and death. More than one-half of all HAE patients experience a laryngeal attack at some point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Therefore, all patients should be educated about the early signs and symptom of laryngeal attacks, even if the individual has never experienced one. There should also be a specific plan for how the individual will access emergency treatment (see <a href=\"#H92104964\" class=\"local\">'Laryngeal attacks'</a> below). Gastrointestinal attacks can range from mild to severe, but usually resolve without serious complications unless the patient undergoes unnecessary surgical interventions because the disorder is not recognized as HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cutaneous attacks are not associated with significant risk of serious complications or death but often cause substantial morbidity, as patients' lives can be significantly disrupted by repeated episodes.</p><p>In HAE, deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) leads to excessive production of the vasoactive mediator bradykinin, which leads to episodic increases in vascular permeability and angioedema. The bradykinin-mediated angioedema of HAE is fundamentally different from the angioedema that occurs with allergic reactions (which is mediated by histamine and other mast cell mediators), and it does not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Instead, first-line therapies for HAE act by replacing C1INH or by blocking the production or function of bradykinin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915658664\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipping patients for emergency care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HAE is rare, and clinicians in emergency settings may not be familiar with the disease or its treatment. Therefore, as soon as a patient has been diagnosed with HAE, a plan for emergency care should be put in place, with particular focus on how the patient should seek care in the event of a laryngeal attack. Patients should be educated that any swelling involving the airway is potentially life-threatening and should be treated as an emergency. All patients should have a plan for accessing treatment rapidly. An important concept that has arisen with the availability of the newer therapies is that of a personalized care plan that takes into account the severity of disease, resources available, and the patient's values and preferences regarding the different therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, clinicians or their representatives should communicate with the hospitals nearest to the patient's home to ensure that acute therapies are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be equipped with a form that summarizes treatments for acute episodes of angioedema to assist in communication with emergency providers and ensure appropriate care (full-sized and wallet forms are provided) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70252\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef70252 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62004\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef62004 \">form 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some countries (not the United States), call centers have been established to provide 24-hour phone access to HAE expert clinicians who can be consulted for help with emergency treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92105783\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several first-line therapies for acute treatment of episodes of angioedema in HAE which are summarized in the table and discussed in more detail below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87450 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'First-line agents: Dosing, efficacy, and adverse reactions'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C1 inhibitor (C1INH) concentrate, derived from human plasma (plasma-derived C1INH or pdC1INH) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'C1 inhibitor (plasma-derived)'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c1-esterase-inhibitor-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Recombinant human C1 inhibitor</a> (rhC1INH, conestat alfa) (see <a href=\"#H2297494\" class=\"local\">'Recombinant C1 inhibitor'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Icatibant</a>, a synthetic bradykinin B<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist (see <a href=\"#H2297196\" class=\"local\">'Bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ecallantide</a>, a recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Kallikrein inhibitor (United States only)'</a> below)</p><p/><p>A clinical response should be evident within two hours with first-line therapies.

Initiating treatment at home (or other settings away from a medical environment) can decrease the delay between the onset of symptoms and time of treatment, and time to start of improvement and resolution of swelling are both significantly shorter when therapies can be given at home. All of the first-line therapies for HAE are likely to be effective if given in the first few hours of the angioedema attack (when the swelling is increasing). Most patients are willing and able to initiate treatment of acute attacks at home. The medications which can be given at home by the patient or by a nursing service on demand are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C1INH concentrate (plasma-derived or recombinant), which may be self-administered or given by a caregiver or nurse through a peripheral intravenous line at the first sign of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Airway angioedema can present as a sensation of throat swelling, change in voice quality, difficulty swallowing secretions, or difficulty breathing. Angioedema usually progresses over hours, although it can escalate precipitously. Intubation may become very difficult due to distortion of the anatomy of the upper airway. Features of laryngeal attacks and patterns of progression are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Laryngeal attacks'</a>.)</p><p>A first-line therapy (C1 inhibitor [C1INH], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a>) should be administered as early as possible in the attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87450 \">table 1</a>). Patients who have first-line therapies at home and self-administer an initial dose should still seek medical care promptly, in case further intervention is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92105049\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and protection of the upper airway is the first and most important management issue in the patient with an acute attack involving any part of the airway, because none of the available therapies, including first-line agents, can be considered universally effective in all cases. In addition, these agents take time to work and the patient's airway must be protected in the interim.</p><p>Intubation should be attempted immediately if stridor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of respiratory arrest are present. A clinician trained in difficult airway management and able to perform tracheostomy should be summoned if possible, because failed attempts can lead to fatal obstruction. Emergent cricothyroidotomy may be required at this stage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the patient is assessed and either intubated or deemed stable, additional treatment can be considered. Transfer to the intensive care unit should be arranged, unless the laryngeal angioedema responds promptly to treatment in a stable patient. Frequent and meticulous monitoring of airway status should continue throughout the course of the attack until complete resolution, and patients should not be discharged until all airway symptoms have resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92105342\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal attacks present with varying degrees of gastrointestinal colic, nausea, vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea, which result from bowel wall edema. Gastrointestinal attacks can range from mild to severe, but usually resolve without serious complications, unless patients undergo unnecessary surgical interventions because the disorder is not recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The clinical presentation and evaluation of gastrointestinal attacks is reviewed in more detail separately.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal attacks'</a>.)</p><p>When a patient with known or suspected HAE presents with gastrointestinal colic, the clinician must determine if the<strong> </strong>abdominal symptoms are actually due to angioedema or to an unrelated process. Patients who have had previous gastrointestinal attacks should be questioned carefully to ascertain if their current symptoms are similar to past episodes.</p><p>The clinical response to one of these first-line therapies can be valuable in distinguishing gastrointestinal attacks of HAE from other abdominal pathologies. With all of the first-line therapies, clinical response should be evident within two hours, keeping in mind that improvement is usually most prompt when the therapy is given in the first several hours of the episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87450 \">table 1</a>). If given later in the attack, a slower, more gradual response may be seen. However, if there is no response at all two hours after the initial dose, then evaluation for other causes of abdominal symptoms should proceed.</p><p>If first-line therapies are not available, then management of gastrointestinal attacks is largely supportive. Alternatively, two units of plasma can be administered after reviewing the risk of disease transmission with the patient. Dosing is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92105549\"><span class=\"h3\">Rehydration and symptomatic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy to abort the attack is most important, but some patients with gastrointestinal attacks also require treatment for dehydration and pain, particularly if effective treatment was not given early in the attack.

Thus, consideration of treating early rather than waiting until swelling becomes more severe should be given. Acute therapies are less likely to provide relief when given late in an attack. However, the decision to treat obviously depends upon the availability of acute therapies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87450 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE AGENTS: DOSING, EFFICACY, AND ADVERSE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medications used for acute treatment of episodes of angioedema in HAE are discussed in this section, with proposed mechanism of action, dosing, efficacy data, and side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87450\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87450 \">table 1</a>).

It is administered intravenously for treatment of acute attacks. Plasma-derived C1INH is the best studied first-line therapy for acute episodes of angioedema in patients with HAE. C1INH acts at several points in the pathways important in the generation of angioedema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87451 \">figure 1</a>).

The angioedema of HAE is mediated by bradykinin and does not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Instead, first-line therapies for HAE act by replacing the C1 inhibitor (C1INH)that is deficient or dysfunctional in this disease or by inhibiting the production or function of bradykinin. (See <a href=\"#H92104744\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because HAE is rare, clinicians in emergency settings may not be familiar with the disease or its treatment. Once the diagnosis has been established, it is helpful for patients to be equipped with a personalized form or wallet card containing information about the treatment of acute attacks, which can assist emergency providers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70252\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef70252 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62004\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef62004 \">form 2</a>).
