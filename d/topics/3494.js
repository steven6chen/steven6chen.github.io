It often involves the sex organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). Sometimes the pain is tied to problems with the intestines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 2</a>) or the bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463910055\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes chronic pelvic pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pelvic pain can be caused by several medical conditions, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endometriosis</strong> &ndash; This is a condition in which cells that should exist only in the uterus begin to grow outside the uterus. Women who have endometriosis often have very painful periods. They also sometimes have problems getting pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease</strong> &ndash; Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is often caused by an infection that you catch during sex. Some women have pain long after the infection starts and is treated. They also can have problems getting pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</strong> &ndash; This is a condition that affects the intestines and causes both pain and problems with bowel movements. Women with IBS usually also have constipation, diarrhea, or both.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder pain <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/interstitial</span> cystitis</strong> &ndash; This condition causes the bladder to hurt when it is getting full. Women with this problem often feel better when they empty their bladder, so they go to the bathroom often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic floor pain</strong> &ndash; Pelvic floor pain involves the muscles in the pelvic area, which can become tight and tender.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibromyalgia</strong> &ndash; This is a pain disorder that causes pain in several parts of the body, not just the pelvic area.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463910062\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have pelvic pain, your doctor or nurse will probably give you a regular pelvic exam. He or she might also order some blood or urine tests. Depending on your situation, you might also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic ultrasound</strong> &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create an image of your pelvic organs. Doctors can use this test to spot fluid-filled sacs (called cysts), abnormal growths, and other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laparoscopy</strong> &ndash; This is a procedure done in an operating room. The doctor makes a small incision near your belly button and inserts a device called a laparoscope. Then the doctor looks through the laparoscope to see if he or she can find the cause of your pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463910069\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pelvic pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your pelvic pain. Possible treatments could include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change in diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to help loosen or relax the muscles in the pelvic area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Talk&quot; therapy or other types of counseling, which can help you learn ways to cope and manage the pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the cause of the pain, if possible</p><p/><p>Some women benefit from treatment at a pain clinic. Pain clinics offer special treatments for pain, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines that come in shots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture, which involves having needles inserted into your skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices that block pain using mild electrical shocks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biofeedback, a technique that helps you learn how to control certain muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation exercises</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463910076\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic pelvic pain in women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
