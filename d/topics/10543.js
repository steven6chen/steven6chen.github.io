The major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, in decreasing order of frequency of occurrence.

In patients with early stage NSCLC, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is an alternative to open thoracotomy for patients undergoing lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Proximal tumors may not be readily resected by lobectomy, thereby requiring a more extensive procedure. In this situation, sleeve resection is preferred over pneumonectomy if possible, based upon equivalent oncologic results, better preservation of pulmonary function and avoidance of the complications of pneumonectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Limited (sublobar) resection may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate a full lobectomy because of severely compromised pulmonary function, advanced age, or other extensive comorbidity. This approach should probably be limited to primary tumors &le;3 cm. Advances in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) facilitated the utilization of limited resections in selected high-risk patients. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Data regarding the relative efficacy of limited resection compared with lobectomy are limited, with studies generally demonstrating an association between limited resection and worse survival rates compared with lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. However, there may be certain subsets of patients for whom limited resection yields similar results as lobectomy, for example, patients with small, peripheral tumors or elderly patients, particularly those with adenocarcinoma histology.</p><p>The best evidence, albeit still limited, comes from the Lung Cancer Study Group trial 801. In this study 276 patients with peripheral T1N0 (stage IA) NSCLC were randomly assigned during surgery to either lobectomy or a more limited procedure (ie, wedge resection, segmentectomy) after intraoperative assessment of hilar and lobar lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was a threefold increase in the rate of local recurrence (5.4 versus 1.9 percent), and a trend toward lower survival rates with limited resection compared with lobectomy. It should be noted that the data from this study are approaching a quarter century, predating positron emission tomography (PET) scans for instance, and that this study grouped together the non-anatomic and anatomic sublobar resections. </p><p>Retrospective analyses have also found that survival generally appears to be lower with limited resection rather than lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. For example, a retrospective study from the National Cancer Database of almost 3000 patients with stage IA disease undergoing either lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection, matched by propensity score, found that segmental and wedge resections were associated with a worse overall survival (OS) compared with lobectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7 and 1.5, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, several prospective non-randomized studies have reported favorable long-term survival following wedge resection or segmentectomy among patients with peripheral N0 lung cancers &le;2 cm in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>], particularly those with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of patients diagnosed with stage I or II NSCLC between 1992 and 1997 suggested similar survival outcomes with lobectomy and limited resection in patients over the age of 71 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, a more recent SEER study of patients diagnosed with stage IA NSCLC between years 1998 and 2010 suggested worsened survival among patients older than 65 years treated with limited resection versus lobectomy (though equivalent survival outcomes were seen in the subset of these patients with adenocarcinoma histology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The discrepancy between the results of these retrospective analyses may reflect differences in patients enrolled as well as the time periods during which the studies took place.</p><p>Increasingly, the role of the true anatomic segmentectomy, specifically, is being reported as an alternative to lobectomy in the management of carefully selected patients with asymptomatic small peripheral pathologic stage I NSCLC. Although randomized phase III trials are ongoing comparing segmentectomy with lobectomy in the management of patients with such small lesions or a subset of these, single institution series have reported equivalent results to both historical and contemporary lobectomy cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/11-13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,15,16</a>]. A 2014 meta-analysis suggests that this equivalence is only seen for lesions &le;2 cm in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A thorough nodal dissection with frozen section evaluation of all of the nodes harvested from the hilum up to the segmental tree should confirm the N0 status of the clinical stage I malignancy before committing to segmentectomy, and the presence of N1 involvement should mandate a lobectomy in individuals that have adequate cardiopulmonary reserves. Some small lesions are not amenable to segmentectomy due to their location: lobectomies are usually favored in such a scenario, although extended segmentectomies and bisegmentectomies have been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529594474\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although intraoperative brachytherapy has been suggested as a way to decrease the incidence of local recurrence seen with limited resections, clinical trial evidence does not support a role for this technique.</p><p>The phase III ALLIANCE trial that enrolled 224 patients found no difference between sublobar resection alone and sublobar resection combined with intraoperative placement of iodine-125 seeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. With a median follow-up of 4.4 years, local progression occurred in only 17 patients (8 percent) overall, and there was no significant difference between the two treatment arms.

In high volume centers with significant VATS experience, VATS lobectomy has been reported to decrease surgical morbidity, including perioperative pain, and seems to be particularly useful for those with significant medical comorbidities.</p><p>The decreased morbidity with VATS may enhance compliance with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. As an example, in a nonrandomized series of 100 consecutive patients who underwent lobectomy, patients managed with VATS had significantly fewer delayed (18 versus 58 percent with open thoracotomy) and reduced (26 versus 49 percent) chemotherapy doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

All patients initially underwent sampling of side-specific hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. The 1111 patients whose sampled nodes were negative were then randomly assigned to a systematic nodal dissection or not. Systematic lymph node dissection did not improve survival of patients with early stage NSCLC nor did it decrease the incidence of local or regional recurrence. Surprisingly, unsuspected N2 involvement was identified in only 3.8 percent of patients randomly assigned to systematic nodal dissection, possibly a reflection that the pre-randomization lymph node sampling may have been quite thorough for many patients on this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1242764191\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive resection margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with microscopic involvement of the resection margin with tumor (R1) following seemingly complete resection have a significantly poorer prognosis than for those with negative microscopic margins (R0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>].

Definitive RT is also occasionally used in selected patients without distant metastases who have a local recurrence following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516535756\"><span class=\"h2\">Stereotactic body radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SBRT delivers a single or very limited number of high-dose fractions to a radiographically discrete treatment volume by using multiple convergent beams. This results in a rapid fall-off of dose at the edge of the target volume and a clinically insignificant dose to adjacent normal tissue. SBRT is the preferred RT technique for the definitive management of peripheral stage I lesions. Alternative fractionation schedules (eg, 48 Gy in four fractions, 50 Gy in five fractions, or 60 Gy in eight fractions) are also frequently used for central lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In an observational study from the Netherlands, patterns of care and outcome were analyzed in 875 patients (age 75 years or older) treated between 1999 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This period was divided into the period before SBRT was introduced (1999 to 2001), partial availability (2002 to 2004), and full accessibility (2005 to 2007). Over the three periods, there was a progressive increase in the use of radiotherapy (26, 32, and 42 percent, respectively), with 23 and 55 percent of RT using SBRT in the second and third periods. There was a concomitant decrease in the fraction of patients opting for no active treatment (38, 32, and 26 percent, respectively). There was a statistically significant increase in survival associated with the use of SBRT, whereas outcomes remained constant over the three periods with surgery or observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3193180469\"><span class=\"h3\">SBRT versus surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results from nonrandomized phase I and II studies have led to comparisons of SBRT with surgery in patients who are surgical candidates. </p><p>Prior to 2010, three randomized trials were designed to compare the efficacy of SBRT with surgical resection for the operable patient population (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group [ACOSOG] Z4099, The ROSEL Trial, and the Accuray Trial).

At a median follow-up of 40 months, the overall survival was better at three years in patients treated with SBRT compared with surgery (95 versus 79 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.14, 95% CI 0.02-1.19). However, there were no significant differences in rates of locoregional or distant recurrence or progression-free survival, and the improved overall survival may be attributable to a better safety profile with SBRT compared with surgery. However, this pooled analysis must be interpreted with caution given the very limited number of patients. </p><p>At least two other trials are now randomizing patients with operable stage I NSCLC to surgery or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR): the Joint Lung Cancer Trialist's Coalition STABLE-MATES trial (<a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02468024?term=STABLE-MATES&rank=1&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX//H/lCKGrzlGu03gYcMJXuTK3xOgZRWSzh35RvrgLNrXQnXVeh/jIkzXpNoLTAjRBCx38HoIw4sojzH0eCJTCt2s3/C11YTM7xvny98iICXW6jcSCuOx1F&amp;TOPIC_ID=4642\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02468024</a>), and the Veterans Affairs Lung cancer surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy trial (<a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=NCT02984761&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&amp;token=VOLfqN9YPN+Tz0I/pvMsBlDdlfWoiWk0WHUler2l8juznkeTXNdUVi0tV5dlnfo3czgMGz7F2Ps7NYUymsU+qwtZWAqInicKB2vLH/xWguHSyqV8+pZfvlawrLdTH8RarwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4642\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02984761</a>).

On multivariate analysis, cancer-specific mortality was significantly higher with SBRT compared with lobectomy (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.09-1.94). However, the difference was not statistically significant when SBRT was compared with sublobar resection (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93-1.68). Short-term mortality was lower in patients managed with SBRT (90-day mortality for SBRT, sublobar resection, and lobectomy 1.4, 2.5, and 3.6 percent, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in short-term mortality was also observed in a National Cancer Database analysis of 8216 patients treated with SBRT versus 76,623 patients who underwent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-i-and-stage-ii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].
