Children with IS typically exhibit epileptic spasms along with the electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern known as hypsarrhythmia. The triad of spasms, arrest of psychomotor development, and hypsarrhythmia is known as West syndrome.</p><p>IS as used in this topic is not considered to be interchangeable with the term &quot;epileptic spasms.&quot; Epileptic spasms refers not only to the seizures seen in IS but also to late-onset spasms and periodic spasms.</p><p>While relatively rare, IS is a significant disorder because of the strong association with developmental delay or regression (75 to 93 percent of affected children), high mortality rate, refractoriness to conventional antiseizure drugs, and responsiveness to hormonal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of IS are reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis, and management and prognosis are discussed separately.

In a cross-sectional, population-based surveillance system that included 21 electroencephalogram (EEG) laboratories in Atlanta, Georgia, the incidence was 2.9 per 10,000 live births among children born in 1975 to 1977 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prevalence among 10-year-old children was 2.0 per 10,000, the lower prevalence than incidence likely reflecting the substantial mortality of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. However, a history of IS was found in a substantial proportion, 12 percent, of children with profound mental retardation.</p><p>Period changes in incidence rates of IS are stable over time in some reports but variable in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,8</a>]. The differences are likely due in part to the relatively small number of patients. In a study of 57 patients from Finland during the period of 1960 to 1992, the incidence remained stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a report from Canada that included 75 patients recorded over a 20-year period, annual and five-year incidence rates varied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. During two consecutive periods (1979 to 1992 and 1993 to 1998), the estimated average annual incidence decreased from 3.31 to 1.73 per 10,000 live births.</p><p>Some studies have found that boys and girls appear to be affected equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>], while others suggest that boys are somewhat more likely to be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>IS occurs in children of all ethnic groups. In the Atlanta, Georgia study mentioned above, IS occurred in similar proportions in Caucasian and African-American children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While some patients with IS have an inherited disorder, such as tuberous sclerosis, most cases are sporadic.

A genetic susceptibility that is multifactorial appears to exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, environmental factors such as anoxia or birth trauma may be required to precipitate seizures.</p><p>Recurrence rates with families without a defined genetic syndrome vary depending upon the features associated with IS. In one study of 77 families, the empiric recurrence risk of IS among siblings was estimated as 15 per 1000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a report that excluded familial diseases, the recurrence risk for the idiopathic or cryptogenic group (IS with prior normal development and no known etiology) was &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>De novo mutations in various genes are being increasingly recognized as a cause of IS in some children with otherwise unexplained IS. (See <a href=\"#H281723496\" class=\"local\">'Other genetic mutations'</a> below.)</p><p>Rare families demonstrate X-linked inheritance of IS. Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (<em>ARX</em>) gene (which maps to Xp21.3-Xp22.1) are associated with a familial syndrome of IS, severe mental retardation, and subsequent epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Other affected members within the same family may have variant syndromes with some combination of mental retardation along with dystonia, myoclonic seizures, lissencephaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal genitalia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Other loci have been identified. Two severely affected unrelated female patients with IS had balanced X:autosome translocations disrupting the gene encoding serine-threonine kinase 9 (STK9), also known as cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) (which maps to Xp22.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Mutations in this gene have been reported in individuals with severe neurodevelopmental disorders including a Rett syndrome-like phenotype and early-onset seizures including IS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Accurate genetic testing is available for X-linked IS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Traditionally, IS is typically classified as symptomatic versus cryptogenic: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with symptomatic IS have an identified etiology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significant developmental delay at the time of spasm onset</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cryptogenic IS have no known etiology and normal development at the time of spasm onset</p><p/><p>An International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Workshop on IS proposed the addition of an idiopathic group. This category includes patients with normal development at onset, normal examination and neuroimaging, and hypsarrhythmic electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern without focal epileptiform abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The proportion of etiologic categories of IS varies among reports. This wide range results from use of different definitions, the early age at diagnosis when neurodevelopmental status may be difficult to assess, and the increased use of neuroimaging studies that reveal an underlying cause in most cases. In a report from the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island from 1978 to 1998, the proportion of etiologic categories was 68, 24, and 8 percent for symptomatic, cryptogenic, and idiopathic, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, in a series of 140 affected patients whose evaluation included computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positron emission tomography (PET), 96 percent of the cases were classified as symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The medical evaluation of these patients was somewhat more extensive than is typical; it is unlikely that as high a proportion of patients evaluated in the community would be classified as symptomatic.</p><p>In a prospective, multicenter study on the evaluation of new-onset IS from the National Infantile Spasms Consortium, 251 infants were enrolled, and a cause was identified in 161 patients (64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The most commonly identified causes were structural-acquired (22 percent), genetic (14 percent), structural-congenital (11 percent), genetic-structural (10 percent), metabolic (5 percent), and infection (2 percent). Clinical evaluation and MRI provided a specific diagnosis in 55 percent of infants. These results emphasize the importance of initial clinical evaluation and MRI in the evaluation of newly diagnosed IS, followed by genetic and metabolic testing if no obvious etiology is identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-infantile-spasms#H415157609\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of infantile spasms&quot;, section on 'Etiologic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic infantile spasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic IS results from a known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorder. One or more etiologic factors can be identified in the majority (60 to 70 percent) of cases of IS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Follow-up evaluation with neuroimaging and PET may increase the proportion with a known cause to as high as 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/24,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26-28</a>]. </p><p>The critical time of the insult typically occurs in the prenatal, perinatal, or early postnatal period. Prenatal factors account for the greatest proportion of cases of West syndrome, 43 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The most common prenatal abnormality is a malformation of the CNS.

Other CNS malformations that may result in IS include cerebral dysgenesis (eg, Aicardi syndrome), lissencephaly (eg, Miller-Dieker syndrome), holoprosencephaly, and hemimegalencephaly. Nearly all patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome and Aicardi syndrome have IS at some stage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miller-Dieker syndrome &ndash; Miller-Dieker syndrome is caused by a disturbance in neuroblastic migration during CNS development, resulting in lissencephaly.

IS occurs in as many as 68 percent of patients with TSC, and 7 to 25 percent of patients with IS have TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]. The actual incidence of TSC in children with IS may be even higher because the clinical signs of TSC may not be apparent when spasms first present.

This wide range results from the use of different definitions, the early age at diagnosis when neurodevelopmental status may be difficult to assess, and the increased use of neuroimaging studies that may reveal an underlying cause.

The age at onset of spasms appears to correlate with the location of focal cerebral lesions and follows the normal sequence of brain maturation. This correlation was illustrated by a series of 93 patients who had lesions confined to one of three regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-infantile-spasms/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].
