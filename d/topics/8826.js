In general, induction immunosuppressive strategies utilized by kidney transplant centers fall into one of two categories. One strategy relies upon high doses of conventional immunosuppressive agents, while the other utilizes antibodies directed against T-cell antigens in combination with lower doses of conventional agents.</p><p>The optimal prophylactic induction immunosuppressive therapy to prevent kidney transplant rejection remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Our approach to induction therapy in adults undergoing kidney transplantation is discussed in this topic. Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy is discussed separately.

The optimal regimen, including induction therapy, is not clear. A large number of controlled, randomized trials and meta-analyses indicate that induction therapy consisting of biologic antibodies plus conventional immunosuppressive agent therapy is superior to conventional agent therapy alone in reducing kidney allograft rejection and allograft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H42027667\" class=\"local\">'rATG-Thymoglobulin versus no induction'</a> below.)</p><p>Among patients undergoing kidney transplantation, we therefore recommend induction therapy consisting of antibody therapy plus conventional immunosuppressive therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F108388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108388 \">table 1</a>). One exception is Caucasian recipients of two-haplotype-identical, living, related allografts.

Polyclonal antibodies contain antibodies to a wide variety of human T-cell surface antigens, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Thymoglobulin is a polyclonal immunosuppressive agent that is generated in rabbits. Although there is no generic formulation, it is commonly referred to as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a>, or rATG. This may produce some confusion, as there are other rATGs, such as one produced by Fresenius. The immunogen for rATG-Thymoglobulin is human thymocytes, while, for rATG-Fresenius, the immunogen is a Jurkat T-cell leukemia line. The preparations also differ in potency and efficacy. Another polyclonal antibody, Atgam, is a purified gamma globulin solution. It is obtained by immunization of horses with human thymocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Monoclonal antilymphocyte antibodies include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>.

With this view, more aggressive immunosuppression is justified in patients at significantly increased risk of rejection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F108391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108391 \">figure 1</a>). In the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines, for example, risk factors for acute rejection include one or more of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger recipient and older donor age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African-American ethnicity (in the United States)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panel reactive antibody (PRA) greater than 0 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a donor-specific antibody (DSA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood group incompatibility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed onset of graft function </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold ischemia time greater than 24 hours</p><p/><p>In such patients, the 2009 KDIGO guidelines suggest the use of lymphocyte-depleting agents, which are potent immunosuppressive agents, rather than interleukin-2 (IL<strong>-</strong>2) receptor antibodies. By comparison, among patients not at high immunologic risk, the guidelines recommend the use of IL-2 receptor antibodies due, in part, to a meta-analysis showing a decreased risk of rejection with these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some UpToDate contributors to this topic administer an IL-2 receptor antibody to low-risk patients; however, other contributors administer lymphocyte-depleting agents to most adult patients undergoing kidney transplantation, regardless of risk for acute rejection.

We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a> if rATG-Thymoglobulin cannot be given. (See <a href=\"#H540717392\" class=\"local\">'Basiliximab in patients who should not receive rATG-Thymoglobulin'</a> below.)</p><p>This initial intraoperative dose of rATG-Thymoglobulin is followed by 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of rATG-Thymoglobulin per day for the next two days (ie, a total of three doses). The rationale for our approach is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H1066069353\" class=\"local\">'Dosing strategies for rATG-Thymoglobulin'</a> below.)</p><p>The dose of rATG-Thymoglobulin is skipped if the white blood cell count falls to less than <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/microL</span> or the platelet count decreases to less than <span class=\"nowrap\">75,000/microL</span>. A half dose of rATG-Thymoglobulin is administered for a white blood cell count between 2000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">3000/microL</span> or a platelet count between 75,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span>. The optimal cumulative dose for rATG is not known, and there is some variability between centers. Cumulative doses below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> have been found to be less effective than higher doses, although doses above 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> are probably not necessary for kidney patients. Some programs use lower doses for low-risk recipients of living-related-donor kidneys and higher doses for recipients of deceased-donor kidneys and others perceived to be at higher risk for rejection.</p><p>This rATG-Thymoglobulin regimen is combined with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy, which begins preoperatively.

In addition to induction therapy, additional measures such as plasmapheresis and immunoabsorption are generally required to decrease circulating ABO antibody titers and reduce the risk of acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR).

However, given the underlying immunosuppressed state of HIV-infected patients, prolonged lymphocyte depletion with antibody induction therapy could potentially increase their risk of developing opportunistic infections.</p><p>The use of induction immunosuppression in HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients remains controversial, and there is no uniform agreement among UpToDate authors and editors about the optimal approach in these patients. Some centers avoid the use of antibody induction therapy among HIV-infected transplant recipients. In centers that use antibody induction therapy, some use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a> (an IL-2 receptor antibody) based upon data from two studies of HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients that demonstrated an increased risk of infection among those treated with rATG-Thymoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Compared with no induction, induction with either rATG-Thymoglobulin or an IL-2 receptor antibody was associated with a decreased risk of delayed graft function (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.84) and death-censored graft loss (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.89).
