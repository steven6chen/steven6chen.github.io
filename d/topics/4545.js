However, this is an inexact use of the term, because it also implies etiology. Many corneal abnormalities are more appropriately called &quot;corneal epithelial defects,&quot; while corneal abrasion more strictly refers to a defect in the epithelial surface of the cornea that is caused by mechanical trauma to the surface of the eye. Nevertheless, since &quot;corneal epithelial defect&quot; is not a term in general usage by patients and providers, we will use both terms interchangeably to refer to corneal epithelial defects of all etiologies.</p><p>Corneal abrasions can be classified as traumatic, including foreign body related and contact lens related, or spontaneous. Spontaneous defects in the corneal epithelium may occur with no immediate antecedent injury or foreign body. Eyes that have suffered a previous traumatic abrasion or eyes that have an underlying defect in the corneal epithelium are prone to this problem. Spontaneous corneal abrasions are also known as recurrent erosions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14488631\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any patient who complains of severe eye pain with photophobia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foreign body sensation preventing opening of the eye generally can be presumed to have a corneal epithelial defect. The provider must then first rule out penetrating trauma, and second an infectious infiltrate, especially herpes simplex virus infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86913\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86913 \">picture 1</a>).

Treatment options vary based upon the subtype of corneal abrasion. Children with corneal abrasions are treated similarly to adults with some age-specific modifications. (See <a href=\"#H7154979\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric considerations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7154919\"><span class=\"h2\">Traumatic and foreign body abrasions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of topical antibiotics and, for large abrasions, cycloplegics have been the mainstay of therapy for decades, along with daily follow-up until the eye is healed. Patching was previously routine but is no longer recommended for most patients. (See <a href=\"#H7154949\" class=\"local\">'Patching'</a> below.)</p><p>Animal studies suggest that tetanus prophylaxis is warranted for penetrating eye injuries but is <strong>not</strong> necessary for corneal abrasions or foreign bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients who have a corneal abrasion with contaminated material (farm instruments, vegetable matter) are at risk for developing bacterial keratitis; this is the most common cause of bacterial keratitis among rural agricultural laborers in undeveloped countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These patients warrant daily monitoring for corneal infiltrate or ulceration. (See <a href=\"#H7154997\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7154925\"><span class=\"h3\">Foreign body removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a corneal foreign body is detected, an attempt can be made to remove it by irrigation after the instillation of topical anesthetic. This is particularly helpful in the case of multiple superficial foreign bodies (eg, sand). An attempt can then be made to remove the foreign body with a swab, using direct visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Foreign bodies under the lid should be removed after flipping the lid. If the foreign body cannot be dislodged by irrigation or with a swab, the patient should be treated by an individual trained and supervised in the use of instruments to dislodge foreign bodies off the ocular surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This procedure is performed using magnification (usually a slit lamp, sometimes loupes) and a metal instrument. Topical anesthetic is instilled in the eye. The instrument used can be a 25G needle or a foreign body spud. Appropriate technique, including patient instruction, tangential approach to the cornea, and stabilization of the hand on the zygoma, is required to insure patient cooperation and to avoid further injury to the cornea.</p><p>Typically, ophthalmology residents and residents in emergency medicine and in family practice receive formal training in the removal of corneal foreign bodies. Those without formal training should <strong>not</strong> approach the globe with sharp instruments; an appropriately trained clinician should be consulted if removal with a swab is unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The foreign body should be removed within 24 hours. The patient should be treated in the meantime with a topical antibiotic ointment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>) four times a day and no patch.</p><p>It is not possible to clinically distinguish infected from non-infected corneal bodies. In one study, 14 percent of 63 removed foreign bodies (the majority of which were metallic) cultured positive; the major pathogen was coagulase negative Staphylococcus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Neither the mechanism of injury, the presence of a rust ring, nor the time present in the cornea allowed prediction of the presence or absence of infection. Nevertheless, foreign bodies need not be sent for culture; all patients with foreign body associated abrasions are treated with empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H7154937\" class=\"local\">'Topical antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7154931\"><span class=\"h4\">Rust ring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After removal of a foreign body containing iron there is often a residual rust ring and reactive infiltrate. Patients with rust ring should be treated as patients with corneal abrasions. The rust ring itself is not harmful and will usually resorb gradually. If there is failure of the epithelium to heal after two to three days, debridement of rust ring can be considered by clinicians trained in the use of instruments at the slit lamp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Removal of rust ring on a routine basis at time of foreign body removal is <strong>not</strong> recommended because of potential damage to Bowman&rsquo;s membrane and resultant scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7154937\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that patients with corneal abrasions receive topical antibiotics to prevent superinfection rather than no treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90920\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90920 \">table 3</a>). This practice is primarily based upon clinical experience. Evidence is lacking to indicate whether topical antibiotics prevent infection or shorten the time to healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one small trial comparing topical antibiotic drops to sterile saline in 94 patients, there was no difference in time to healing based upon symptoms, visual acuity, and corneal defect between treatment and control groups. However, the ability of this trial to detect a true difference was limited because of the small sample size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Considerations for selection of topical antibiotics include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ointment is theoretically better than drops because it functions as a lubricant and may reduce disruption of the remaining and newly generated epithelium. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who wear contact lenses, an ointment or drop that covers for <em>Pseudomonas</em> species (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> [Ciloxan, Ciprodar, Sophixin Ofteno], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a> [Ocuflox, Apo-Ofloxacin, Exocin], or, if fluoroquinolones are not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> [Tobrex, Tobral], or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> [Garamycin, Gentocin, Genoptic]) should be selected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are <strong>not</strong> contact lens wearers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> ointment (Ilotycin, Diomycin, Erocin) is a good choice, used four times daily for three to five days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are <strong>not</strong> contact lens wearers and who insist on a drop rather than an ointment, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfacetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfacetamide</a> 10 percent, <span class=\"nowrap\">polymyxin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a></span> (Polytrim, PMS-Polytrimethoprim), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (Ciloxan, Ciprodar, Sophixin Ofteno), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a> (Ocuflox, Apo-Ofloxacin, Exocin) are reasonable choices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90920\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90920 \">table 3</a>). Aminoglycosides should be avoided in these patients because aminoglycosides can be toxic to the epithelium. (See <a href=\"#H7154973\" class=\"local\">'Treatments to avoid'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic preparations containing steroids are <strong>contraindicated</strong> because they slow epithelial healing and reduce host resistance to superinfection.</p><p/><p>The optimal duration and frequency of antibiotic therapy have never been subjected to outcome analysis. It is reasonable to decrease the frequency to twice daily once the foreign body sensation has resolved and to discontinue therapy entirely if the eye is symptom free for 24 hours. Continued symptoms beyond three days warrants evaluation by an ophthalmologist. (See <a href=\"#H7154907\" class=\"local\">'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7154943\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to pain control for corneal abrasions varies according to the size of the abrasion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small corneal abrasions</strong> &ndash; Most small abrasions (less than one-fourth of corneal surface area [eg, a round abrasion that is 4 mm across]) will heal overnight if the lid is down and there is no rubbing or squeezing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mild to moderate pain can typically be controlled with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>) or topical use of ophthalmic NSAID solutions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>). Ophthalmic topical NSAID solutions provide some pain relief and may limit the need for rescue medications, without apparent adverse effects upon healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Some experts note that topical NSAID solutions are painful to apply and expensive which limits adherence and efficacy. Furthermore, the trials of topical NSAIDs for corneal abrasions have not always used a measure of pain reduction that may be clinically relevant and a meta-analysis of these trials judged the evidence for their use as weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the few patients with small abrasions that fail to heal despite these treatments, an oral opioid prescription (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-and-acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone-acetaminophen</a> combination medications) that provides analgesia coverage for 24 hours is typically sufficient to permit healing and resolution of pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large corneal abrasions </strong>&ndash; A large abrasion will not heal overnight and additional measures may be required for pain control and to allow for healing. Oral opioids (eg, acetaminophen-oxycodone combination medications) may be required for 48 hours to provide adequate pain control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cycloplegic (parasympatholytic drops) and patching may also be necessary in some patients, especially those with abrasions that cover &gt;50 percent of the corneal surface as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cycloplegic drops</strong> &ndash; Cycloplegics are parasympatholytic drops that inhibit the miotic (pupil-constricting) response to light; it is this response to light that causes the ache and photophobia of corneal abrasion. These drops do not relieve foreign-body sensation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Patients with large abrasions who are particularly photophobic can be treated for up to 48 hours with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclopentolate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclopentolate</a> (0.5 to 1 percent) one drop twice daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=homatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">homatropine</a> (2.5 to 5 percent) one drop daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90920\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90920 \">table 3</a>). Longer acting drugs such as topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> are used by ophthalmologist for iritis and severe cases of ocular disease; these drugs can interfere with accommodation for weeks and should not be used to treat abrasions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Cycloplegics make the pupil large, causing glare, and also block accommodation, thereby interfering with near work such as reading. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclopentolate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclopentolate</a> (Cyclogyl) 0.5 or 1 percent has the shortest duration of action, but still lasts for 24 to 36 hours. Thus, patients with small abrasions that heal overnight typically find that the side effects of cycloplegic drops outweigh the benefit of pain control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Patching</strong> &ndash; Although data is limited, patching may decrease the pain of large corneal abrasions. Patching is not recommended for small abrasions. (See <a href=\"#H7154949\" class=\"local\">'Patching'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Repeated topical anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Because of the possibility of overuse (ie, use beyond 24 hours) and the risk of inappropriate administration to patients with conditions other than simple corneal abrasions, we discourage the prescribing or dispensing of topical anesthetic agents and favor other means of pain control. According to animal studies, commonly available topical anesthetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proparacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">proparacaine</a> 0.5 percent) can delay corneal epithelial healing, particularly with repeated applications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition to delayed wound healing, anesthetic overuse in which the patient persists in use of the drops, sometimes surreptitiously, for a painful, non-healing surface can ultimately lead to keratopathy, ulceration, perforation, scarring, or blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Limited evidence suggests that brief use (eg, &lt;24 hours) of dilute solutions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proparacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">proparacaine</a> (0.05 percent, versus standardly available 0.5 percent) or preservative-free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a> 1 percent may provide analgesia without impairing healing or leading to serious adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. For example, in a retrospective observational study of 444 patients with corneal abrasions given a 24-hour supply of topical tetracaine at the initial emergency department visit, no patient had serious complications or uncommon adverse events (95% CI, 0 to 0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, definitive outcomes were only known for 120 patients who returned for rechecks. Patients receiving topical tetracaine were more likely to return for emergency department reevaluation and topical tetracaine was prescribed inappropriately, according to the investigator&rsquo;s a priori definition, in 151 patients, including those with large corneal abrasions, retained rust rings, herpes keratitis, anterior uveitis, and corneal erosions. Thus, more evidence is needed to establish the safety of this practice for simple corneal abrasions and, if implemented, strict controls must be in place to avoid overuse and administration to patients with high risk eye conditions. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7154949\"><span class=\"h3\">Patching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that patients with uncomplicated, small, traumatic or foreign body corneal abrasions <strong>not</strong> undergo patching. Patching is also contraindicated for patients with corneal abrasions in patients with recent contact lens wear. (See <a href=\"#H7154955\" class=\"local\">'Abrasions and recent contact lens wear'</a> below.)</p><p>Although data is limited, patching may decrease the pain of large corneal abrasions that cover &gt;50 percent of the corneal surface.</p><p>In theory, a pressure patch promotes epithelial proliferation and migration by keeping the lid lowered and stationary over the epithelial defect; such pressure is also thought to relieve pain. However, a meta-analysis has shown that, in patients with uncomplicated traumatic or foreign body corneal abrasions, the rate of healing is not improved by a patch (seven trials) and that patching does not decrease pain (ten trials) when compared with not patching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, in one trial of patching versus not patching in 201 patients with uncomplicated traumatic or foreign body-related corneal abrasions, patients with traumatic corneal abrasions (n = 120) healed significantly faster, had less pain, and fewer reports of blurred vision when they were not wearing a patch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The amount of photophobia, tearing, and foreign body sensation were similar between the patch and no patch groups.

Even if perforation and vision loss on that basis is averted, there is often permanent corneal scarring that requires corneal transplantation.

However, these individuals are often exquisitely symptomatic to even the smallest epithelial disruption. Our clinical experience is that they do better with frequent application (every one to two hours) of ointment at the first suggestion of symptoms (either an antibiotic such as Ilotycin or over-the-counter lubricant such as Refresh PM or Lacri-Lube), and limited duration of opioid analgesia if needed, rather than patching. Lubricant ointment therapy should be continued at bedtime for months after acute symptoms have resolved as a prophylactic regimen.</p><p>Recurrent erosions that are particularly large or show no signs of healing in 24 hours should be referred to an ophthalmologist who may d&eacute;bride flaps of epithelium and may choose to use an extended wear contact lens as a bandage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These are black fabric patches on an elastic band sold at pharmacies. These patches are designed to cover an unsightly or light sensitive eye with no useful vision; they should not be used in cases of corneal abrasion. They do not keep the lid down as a properly applied pressure patch does, and the elastic applies tension to the patch in a band with resulting pressure on the cornea, increasing corneal edema, and interference with healing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7154979\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment in children is similar to that in adults with the following differences in approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic ointment is preferred over drops both for the persistent lubricating effect and because drops sting. If the child does not tolerate the visual blurring caused by ointment, the ointment can be applied at nap time or before bed.

However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclopentolate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclopentolate</a>, the shortest acting of the cycloplegic agents, stings the most. For this reason, in children receiving cycloplegic drops, it may be preferable for the treating clinician to apply a single drop of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=homatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">homatropine</a> 2.5 to 5 percent in the affected eye at the time of diagnosis. This will produce a sustained effect for a couple of days and thus minimize any further need for drops to be applied by the child's caregivers.</p><p/><p>As in adults, a corneal abrasion in a child typically heals overnight as the child sleeps. Sleep can be aided with analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a sedating antihistamine (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxycodone</a> can be used in young children. </p><p>There may be some mucous crusting of the lids on the first morning, but if the child is happy to keep the eye open once this is wiped away, the abrasion can be considered healed.</p><p>An infant or child with persistent discharge or unwillingness to keep the eye open beyond 24 hours after the injury should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist, because these findings suggest a retained foreign body, poor healing, superinfection, or infectious keratitis.

An ointment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> ophthalmic ointment) is theoretically better than drops because it functions as a lubricant and may reduce disruption of the remaining and newly generated epithelium.
