Patients suffering from TBI of any severity, in both the acute and chronic phases, commonly report excessive daytime sleepiness, increased sleep need, insomnia, and sleep fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

In at least one study, brain-injured patients tended to overestimate insomnia when subjective and objective measures were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Smaller studies using actigraphy, PSG, and multiple sleep latency testing have found a similar trend across a broader range of sleep symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. In a prospective study of 65 patients with TBI of all ranges of severity, sleep-wake disturbances were reported by 72 percent of patients six months post-injury; the most common abnormalities on formal testing were excessive daytime sleepiness (28 percent) and increased sleep need (22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the same cohort (n = 51), two-thirds of patients had persistent sleep-wake disturbances at three years post-injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Sleep-related breathing and movement disorders are also prevalent in the chronic phases of TBI. The reported prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea ranges from 25 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195508\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology and neuropathology of sleep-wake disturbances after TBI are under investigation in both animal models and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Given the prominence of excessive daytime sleepiness and nighttime sleep fragmentation in patients with TBI, several studies have focused on the neuropeptide orexin (also known as hypocretin), which is deficient in human narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy). Orexin neurons in the posterior hypothalamus excite several downstream wake-promoting monoaminergic and cholinergic systems and therefore possess a strong wake-promoting effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Measured orexin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were low in 95 percent of 44 patients within the first four days of moderate to severe TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A small study of four patients who died 7 to 42 days after severe TBI showed a 27 percent reduction in the number of orexin neurons compared with non-TBI controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Likewise, studies using mouse models of mild and moderate TBI show decreased brain orexin levels and decreased orexin neuron activation during wakefulness after brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Deficits in orexin signaling are unlikely to explain all sleep-wake abnormalities, however, especially in the chronic phase of TBI when CSF orexin levels for the most part return to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although there are several other wake-promoting brain regions (eg, ventral periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, basal forebrain, and tuberomammillary nucleus), their roles in TBI have not yet been studied. A postmortem human study in 12 patients with severe TBI showed a 41 percent loss of histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus compared with 16 matched control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Structural brain changes may also play a role in some patients. Abnormal neuroimaging is only found in 5 to 10 percent of patients with mild TBI, although it is likely to miss more subtle brain damage such as diffuse axonal injury or microhemorrhages, which may affect sleep-wake and circadian circuits. In an electrophysiological and imaging study, intracranial hemorrhage was associated with increased sleep need, but this was not influenced by the extent and location of the intracranial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195514\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962417\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom spectrum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common manifestations of sleep-wake disorders after TBI are excessive daytime sleepiness, increased sleep need, and insomnia. Less commonly, patients experience circadian rhythm disturbances and abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep, such as sleep talking, bruxism, and dream enactment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195520\"><span class=\"h3\">Excessive daytime sleepiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness, distinct from fatigue, is a prominent symptom after TBI. The reported frequency in patients with TBI ranges from approximately 50 to 80 percent, compared with an expected rate in the general population of 10 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/16,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24-26</a>].</p><p>Excessive daytime sleepiness refers to the inability to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day, with sleep occurring unintentionally or at inappropriate times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Sleepiness manifests mainly during sedentary activities, in contrast with fatigue, which typically affects pursuit of more active goals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H1822262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>Some individuals with excessive daytime sleepiness after TBI describe daytime sleep attacks, similar to those experienced by patients with narcolepsy. However, additional symptoms of narcolepsy, such as cataplexy and sleep paralysis, are uncommon and have been described only in rare case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. No patient has been reported with the complete syndrome of post-traumatic hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy with cataplexy.</p><p>Excessive daytime sleepiness is often but not always accompanied by a short time to fall asleep on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). A mean sleep latency of &le;8 minutes is generally considered to be abnormal. In addition to a reduced mean sleep latency, some patients have two or more sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) during the MSLT, fulfilling electrophysiological criteria for narcolepsy type 2 (narcolepsy without cataplexy). However, before diagnosing narcolepsy after TBI, insufficient sleep syndrome must be ruled out, as chronic sleep deprivation can produce increased REM sleep pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H23706075\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>In one prospective study of 65 patients six months after TBI, 28 percent had post-traumatic sleepiness and 3 percent met criteria for narcolepsy type 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A similar study found that 6 percent of patients met MSLT criteria for narcolepsy type 2 at a mean of 64 months after TBI, a marked increase compared with the prevalence in the general population (&lt;0.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>]. Other studies have also found that sleepiness persists long term in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3720690536\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195526\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased sleep need (pleiosomnia)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased sleep need is common after TBI. Since the term hypersomnia is often used for both excessive daytime sleepiness and increased sleep need, the term pleiosomnia has been proposed to denote an increased need for sleep per 24 hours compared with the patient's pre-TBI baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In a prospective electrophysiological study of 65 patients who were studied six months after TBI, 22 percent reported that they needed at least two more hours of sleep in a 24-hour period than before the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This general pattern was confirmed in a prospective case control study that included 42 patients with TBI studied six months after injury, in which post-TBI patients slept 1.2 hours more than matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This pattern persisted at 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3720690536\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below.)</p><p>In both of these studies, patients with TBI underestimated both excessive daytime sleepiness and pleiosomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. In addition, daytime sleepiness was more pronounced in TBI patients with shorter sleep duration, suggesting that sleepiness might constitute an epiphenomenon of insufficient sleep in subjects needing more sleep than usual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195532\"><span class=\"h3\">Insomnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia (ie, difficulty falling asleep or sleeping through the night with daytime consequences such as fatigue or irritability) has been widely documented among patients in the chronic phases after TBI. Unlike most other sleep disturbances after TBI, insomnia complaints are more prevalent in mild TBI compared with moderate or severe TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of insomnia include difficulty initiating sleep, sleep fragmentation, and early morning awakenings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The spectrum of insomnia symptoms after TBI is demonstrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 202 patients with TBI (37 percent with moderate to severe TBI) at a mean of two years post-injury found that 65 percent of patients with mild TBI complained of insomnia, compared with 41 percent of patients with moderate to severe TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Approximately one-quarter of patients with mild TBI continued to complain of insomnia five years post-injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another retrospective study, 75 percent of 145 patients with mild TBI reported insomnia after injury; the most common manifestation was waking up too early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among military personnel, the incidence of insomnia appears to increase in a dose-dependent fashion with the number of head injuries incurred, ranging from 6 percent in those with no history of TBI, 20 percent after a single TBI, and 50 percent in those with multiple episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>The presence of insomnia correlates with decreased satisfaction in life, anxiety, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195550\"><span class=\"h3\">Circadian rhythm disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is preliminary evidence that circadian rhythm disorders, including delayed sleep phase or irregular sleep-wake type, occur with increased frequency in patients with TBI.</p><p>Symptoms of a circadian rhythm disorder are easy to overlook and are often misattributed to insomnia. In one study, 36 percent of individuals who complained of insomnia after mild TBI instead met criteria for a circadian rhythm disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The distinction is important, since treatment approaches differ. (See <a href=\"#H1195610\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with delayed sleep-wake phase syndrome typically go to bed late and wake up late relative to the general population. They may complain of difficulty falling asleep at usual bed times, and difficulty getting up at standard wake times. This may be confused with insomnia, in which patients have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep regardless of bed time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-sleep-wake-phase-disorder#H6375478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p>Patients with an irregular sleep-wake rhythm lack a clearly defined circadian rhythm of sleep and wakefulness, such that sleep and wake patterns appear somewhat random across days to weeks. They may complain of both difficulty sleeping at the desired time and excessive daytime sleepiness and naps. Although insomnia can be accompanied by complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness, it is more commonly associated with difficulty napping or sleeping during the day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the acute phase after TBI, circadian rhythm disturbances may be particularly prominent, although more studies are needed. Actigraphy recordings in 16 patients with moderate to severe TBI within the first 10 days post-injury revealed severe fragmentation of the rest-activity cycle, reflecting severe sleep-wake fragmentation and possibly consistent with an irregular sleep-wake type circadian rhythm disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Nevertheless, it is difficult to exclude the confounding effects of pain and anxiety in the acute phase of TBI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195556\"><span class=\"h3\">Abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small studies have suggested that parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders may occur with increased frequency after TBI in both the acute and chronic phases.</p><p>Symptoms include dream reenactment behaviors characteristic of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), somniloquy (sleep talking), sleep-related enuresis, and sleep-related bruxism (teeth grinding).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case control study of 19 adolescents with a history of mild TBI three years before, the following symptoms were more common in patients with TBI compared with controls: somniloquy (42 versus 19 percent), bruxism (42 versus 6 percent), and enuresis (21 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Small studies have found an OSA prevalence ranging from 25 to 35 percent in TBI survivors, which is higher than rates in most general population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/5,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,41,42</a>].

The most common symptoms of OSA in the general population are daytime sleepiness and loud snoring. Additional symptoms include waking up gasping or choking, morning headaches, nocturia, moodiness or irritability, lack of concentration, and memory impairment. On physical examination, patients are often obese and may have evidence of a crowded oropharynx and increased neck circumference. Clinical features of CSA are similar, except that obesity is less likely to be present.

Questions should target multiple sleep domains, including perceived sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbances (including abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep), sleep medication use, daytime dysfunction, and daytime sleepiness. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106689\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106689 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F107236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107236 \">table 2</a>) is a clinical questionnaire encompassing multiple sleep domains that can be useful to guide a structured interview [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>] and has been partially validated in the TBI population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/24,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,68,69</a>].</p><p>For patients who complain predominantly of excessive daytime sleepiness, the history should attempt to differentiate sleepiness from other common complaints such as fatigue, lack of energy, or weakness. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-epworth-sleepiness-scale-ess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) is a widely used instrument for quantifying subjective sleepiness that has also been partially validated in patients with TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/24,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,68,69</a>]. Scores of 10 or more points are generally considered abnormal and support the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness. As with other measures, ESS scores should be used in combination with other tools, as patients with TBI may underestimate their degree of daytime impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)'</a>.)</p><p>In patients whose predominant complaint is insomnia, the history should elicit a detailed description of sleep habits over a 24-hour period and trends over time. This includes questions about sleep quantity and quality, quality of the sleep environment, and daytime symptoms. A sleep diary or log, to be completed by the patient in advance or following the initial evaluation, can be particularly helpful to supplement the history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Sleep diaries have the advantage of assessing sleep quality, sleep quantity, and circadian patterns over many days or weeks. Review of a sleep diary can provide clues to circadian rhythm disturbances, which are often mistaken for insomnia (see <a href=\"#H1195550\" class=\"local\">'Circadian rhythm disturbances'</a> above). To more objectively assess circadian rhythm disorders, actigraphy recordings for two to three weeks are very useful. (See <a href=\"#H346528376\" class=\"local\">'Actigraphy'</a> below.)</p><p>Collateral information from family members and bed partners should be obtained if possible. In particular, bed partners are a more reliable source than the patient for information about snoring, periodic limb movements, acting out of dreams, sleep walking, and other parasomnias. Loud or habitual snoring and witnessed apneas can suggest a diagnosis of obstructive apnea and should prompt PSG, especially if the presenting complaint is daytime sleepiness. (See <a href=\"#H1195604\" class=\"local\">'Polysomnography'</a> below.)</p><p>Given the frequent comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in patients with TBI and their implications for treatment, the history should also probe for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients can be screened for depression by asking about depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. A two- or nine-item screening tool such as the PHQ-9 is easy to use, reliable, and valid in primary care settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The medication list should be reviewed in all patients to identify potentially contributing agents. A wide variety of medications used in the management of acute complications of TBI may contribute to daytime sleepiness, including antiepileptic drugs, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and certain antidepressants. The list is similarly long for drugs that may cause or aggravate insomnia (eg, glucocorticoids, bronchodilators, and central nervous system stimulants). Alcohol use and substance abuse are also relevant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964540\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basic laboratories are likely to be of low yield in the evaluation of sleep-wake disorders.

The electroencephalography (EEG) collected during in-laboratory PSG allows comprehensive assessment of sleep staging and arousals. If obstructive sleep apnea is the overriding suspicion based on the history, home sleep apnea testing is an alternative to in-laboratory PSG.

Patients with TBI often have comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can result in nightmares and other NREM parasomnias.</p><p>All parasomnias are exacerbated by sleep deprivation or sleep fragmentation, and therefore the first-line approach to treatment is to identify and treat causes of poor sleep quality (ie, improve sleep hygiene, avoid alcohol, treat sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome). PTSD-related nightmares can be effectively treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> image-rehearsal therapy with or without cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. If parasomnias persist despite treatment of secondary causes, and are bothersome to the patient, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> is often helpful (ie, 0.5 to 2 mg nightly). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with REM sleep behavior disorder, which can result in violent dream enactment, establishing a safe sleeping environment is the primary goal of treatment. This can be achieved through modification of the sleep environment and pharmacotherapy, if necessary. Medications known to cause or exacerbate REM sleep behavior disorder, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants, should be discontinued or avoided if possible. Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> and high-dose melatonin are effective therapies in patients with frequent, disruptive or injurious behaviors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964474\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstructive sleep apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral modifications, including weight loss, and positive airway pressure therapy are the cornerstones of therapy for OSA. Both have been shown to improve outcomes in the general population in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>], and their effects may be additive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H19916919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'General approach'</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with OSA in the post-TBI setting should be treated similarly, although literature in this specific patient population is sparse. In the one study that examined continuous PAP (CPAP) therapy in patients with TBI, CPAP therapy was associated with a decreased apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and improved sleep quality three&nbsp;months after administration, but it did not improve excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the MSLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. CPAP adherence and medication side effects were not taken into account, however, which could explain the lack of improvement in daytime sleepiness.</p><p>The potential consequences of untreated OSA in patients with TBI were illustrated by a small case control study that included 19 TBI patients with OSA and 16 TBI patients without OSA on nocturnal polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disorders-in-patients-with-traumatic-brain-injury/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Patients with OSA performed significantly worse than those without OSA on tasks of sustained attention and memory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1414136188\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1195502\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiology of post-traumatic sleep-wake disturbances is not well understood. Reductions in wake-promoting neurotransmitters such as orexin and histamine have been implicated in small studies, but they are unlikely to account for the full spectrum of abnormalities, particularly in the chronic phase. (See <a href=\"#H1195508\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common manifestations of sleep-wake disorders after TBI are excessive daytime sleepiness, increased sleep need, and insomnia. Less commonly, patients experience circadian rhythm disturbances; abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep, such as sleep talking, bruxism, and dream enactment; and sleep-disordered breathing. (See <a href=\"#H962417\" class=\"local\">'Symptom spectrum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-wake disorders are diagnosed by history, supplemented by objective sleep testing in selected patients. The goals of the evaluation are to refine the sleep complaint, diagnose specific treatable sleep disorders, and identify any additional medical and psychiatric comorbidities that may be contributing to the sleep disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H4070056861\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment varies according to the dominant symptom or specific sleep disorder as well as relevant comorbidities. Treatment strategies in patients with a history of TBI are generally similar to those in the general population. (See <a href=\"#H4070056906\" class=\"local\">'Symptom-directed therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4070056958\" class=\"local\">'Specific disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with TBI who have persistent and bothersome excessive daytime sleepiness that cannot be explained by other causes or comorbidities, we suggest treatment <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1195618\" class=\"local\">'Excessive daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pharmacologic and behavioral approaches for insomnia in patients with a history of TBI are generally similar to those in the general population. Special consideration should be paid to cognitive impairment, which may increase the risk of side effects from <span class=\"nowrap\">sedative/hypnotic</span> medications, and comorbid affective disorders, which are common in patients with TBI and may require additional therapy.
