Stress incontinence is the most common type in younger women, with the highest incidence in women ages 45 to 49 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/38,69,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,69,75,76</a>].</p><p>Mechanisms of stress incontinence include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urethral hypermobility</strong> &ndash; Urethral hypermobility is thought to stem from insufficient support of the pelvic floor musculature and vaginal connective tissue to the urethra and bladder neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. This causes the urethra and bladder neck to lose the ability to completely close against the anterior vaginal wall. With increases in intra-abdominal pressure (eg, from coughing or sneezing) the muscular tube of the urethra fails to close, leading to incontinence (like stepping on a hose in sand).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insufficient urethral support may be related to loss of connective tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muscular strength due to chronic pressure (ie, high-impact activity, chronic cough, or obesity) or trauma due to childbirth, particularly vaginal deliveries. Childbirth can cause trauma directly to the pelvic muscles and may also damage nerves leading to pelvic muscle dysfunction. Treatments for hypermobility stress incontinence are aimed at providing a backboard of support for the urethra.

In general, ISD results from neuromuscular damage and can be seen in women who have had multiple pelvic or incontinence surgeries. ISD can occur in the presence or absence of urethral hypermobility and typically results in severe urinary leakage even with minimal increases in abdominal pressure. Treatment is aimed at improving urethral blood flow with vaginal estrogen and increasing urethral coaptation with pelvic muscle exercise or surgery. ISD is challenging to treat and has worse surgical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>].

The amount of leakage ranges from a few drops to completely soaked undergarments. &quot;Overactive bladder&quot; is a term that describes a syndrome of urinary urgency with or without incontinence, which is often accompanied by nocturia and urinary frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/70,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,73</a>]. The terms &quot;urgency incontinence&quot; and &quot;overactive bladder with incontinence&quot; are often used interchangeably.</p><p>Urgency incontinence is more common in older women and may be associated with comorbid conditions that occur with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. It is believed to result from detrusor overactivity, leading to uninhibited (involuntary) detrusor muscle contractions during bladder filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. This may be secondary to neurologic disorders (eg, spinal cord injury), bladder abnormalities, increased or altered bladder microbiome, or may be idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/70,83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,83-86</a>].

Associated symptoms can include weak or intermittent urinary stream, hesitancy, frequency, and nocturia. When the bladder is very full, stress leakage can occur or low-amplitude bladder contractions can be triggered resulting in symptoms similar to stress or urgency incontinence.</p><p>Overflow incontinence is caused by detrusor underactivity or bladder outlet obstruction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Detrusor underactivity</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Detrusor underactivity may be caused by impaired contractility of the detrusor muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Impaired urothelial sensory function may also contribute. Studies suggest that detrusor contractility and efficiency decrease with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Severe detrusor underactivity occurs in about 5 to 10 percent of older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/82,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,90</a>]. Other etiologies of detrusor underactivity include smooth muscle damage, fibrosis, low estrogen state, peripheral neuropathy (due to diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, alcoholism), and damage to the spinal detrusor efferent nerves by pathologies affecting the spinal cord (eg, multiple sclerosis, spinal stenosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/91-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-94</a>].

With DHIC, the bladder does not effectively contract to empty and also has low-amplitude hyperactivity, resulting in urgency as well as overflow incontinence. DHIC is particularly difficult to treat as any therapy for overactivity results in increased urinary retention and overflow incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder outlet obstruction</strong> &ndash; Bladder outlet obstruction in women is generally caused by external compression of the urethra. This can occur with fibroids that obstruct the urethra, advanced pelvic organ prolapse (ie, beyond the hymen), or overcorrection of the urethra from prior pelvic floor surgery. Less common causes include external masses or tumors at the level of the bladder outlet, urethral stricture, or uterine incarceration of a retroverted uterus (which can occur in pregnancy or in the setting of fibroids).

Risk factors for urinary incontinence include obesity, parity, mode of delivery, older age, and family history. (See <a href=\"#H21988039\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical types of urinary incontinence are stress incontinence (leakage with maneuvers that increase intraabdominal pressure), urgency incontinence (sudden urgency followed by leakage), mixed incontinence (symptoms of both stress and urgency), and overflow incontinence. &quot;Overactive bladder&quot; is a term that describes a syndrome of urinary urgency, with or without incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H21989323\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other etiologies for urinary incontinence in women include other less common urologic or gynecologic disorders (eg, urogenital fistulas, cancer), neurologic diseases (eg, multiple sclerosis), and potentially reversible causes [eg, medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F101070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101070 \">table 1</a>)]. (See <a href=\"#H21989288\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of urinary incontinence includes characterizing and classifying the type of incontinence, identifying underlying conditions (eg, neurologic disorder or malignancy) that may manifest as urinary incontinence, and identifying potentially reversible causes of incontinence. This evaluation includes a thorough history, urinalysis, and physical examination when appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H21990309\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The history classifies and prioritizes the patient's urinary symptoms, as well as identifies other symptoms that indicate the need to evaluate further for underlying causes of incontinence due to serious conditions or potentially reversible medical or functional conditions. (See <a href=\"#H21990400\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women presenting with complicated symptoms of urinary incontinence or who fail initial behavioral and medical treatments should have a pelvic examination. Additionally, a patient's history may suggest other components of the physical exam that are important in diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H21990869\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A urinalysis should be performed in all patients. If a urinary tract infection is suspected, then a urine culture is obtained. (See <a href=\"#H21990935\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A bladder stress test is used to diagnose stress urinary incontinence. Postvoid residual (PVR) volume and urodynamic testing are not routinely performed. (See <a href=\"#H21990989\" class=\"local\">'Clinical tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a specialist is indicated in a small number of cases: incontinence with <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain or hematuria in the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI), suspected vesicovaginal fistula, abnormal physical examination findings (eg, pelvic organ prolapse), new neurologic symptoms in addition to incontinence or suspected overflow incontinence. Women with three or more culture-proven UTIs in a year or at least two in six months warrant referral to a specialist. (See <a href=\"#H21991295\" class=\"local\">'Specialist referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7940059\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Catherine E DuBeau, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Abrams P, Cardozo L, Fall M, et al.
