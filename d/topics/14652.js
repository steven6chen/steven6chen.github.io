The majority of AIDS-related lymphomas are aggressive, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of B cell origin; nearly 60 percent are diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 40 percent Burkitt lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-manifestations-of-aids-related-lymphomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most patients show widespread rather than nodal disease, frequently involving the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal tract, lungs, bone marrow, and mucocutaneous tissues. Rare cases of primary pulmonary NHL have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-manifestations-of-aids-related-lymphomas/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

In general, larger biopsy samples enable more accurate diagnosis, but a larger biopsy size may require a more invasive procedure. Procedures that are used to obtain tissue for the diagnosis of pulmonary lymphoma include transthoracic needle biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, or surgical lung biopsy (via thoracoscopy or thoracotomy). In general, the use of fine needle aspiration for cytologic diagnosis is discouraged. Core needle biopsy, although often providing limited tissue sample, is preferred when excision would require a more invasive procedure. Tests on biopsy samples, such as flow cytometry (FCM), immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (IGHV) analysis, immunohistochemical analysis, and evidence of Epstein-Barr virus or human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection, are often helpful in confirming the diagnosis and characterizing the type of lymphoma (eg, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma).

While the diagnosis can sometimes be made on the basis of needle aspirate samples from endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), we prefer to obtain an entire lymph node in order to have enough tissue for histologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic studies. The selection of the lymph node to biopsy is typically based on accessibility to mediastinoscopy and likelihood of involvement based on size or 18F-2-deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) avidity. When needle aspirate samples are obtained via EBUS, it is essential to employ techniques such as immunophenotyping and genetic studies.

Occasionally, endobronchial involvement causes lobar collapse. NHL is also associated with pleural effusion, pleural plaques, and pleural masses.

A tissue biopsy rather than needle aspirate is preferred and may be obtained via bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy. When the patient is known to have NHL at other sites, the diagnosis of lung involvement can sometimes be made by transthoracic needle aspiration or transbronchial biopsy.
