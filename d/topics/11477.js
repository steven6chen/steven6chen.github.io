Because of the propensity for scarring and inadequate sampling, nail biopsies are best performed by clinicians with appropriate training and experience. Prerequisites for a successful nail biopsy include a thorough understanding of nail anatomy, adequate anesthesia and hemostasis, and proper patient selection and preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Before performing a nail biopsy, it is important to discuss with the patient the potential benefits and risks of the procedure and address the patient&rsquo;s concerns about pain or scarring.</p><p>This topic will discuss nail biopsy techniques according to anatomic site (eg, nail bed, nail fold, nail matrix). The anatomy of the nail, anesthesia and hemostasis techniques, patient selection, preoperative preparation, and postoperative care are discussed separately.

Partial nail plate avulsion is sufficient in many cases and avoids unnecessary trauma to the adjacent, uninvolved tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83964\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83964 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, complete nail plate avulsion is occasionally necessary to achieve maximum exposure of the nail bed and matrix.

The nail plate can effectively protect the wound and the nail bed for 3 to 12 postoperative weeks. When the avulsed nail plate is put back in place, openings can be made at the base, tip, or laterally to ensure drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86405%7EDERM%2F86421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86405 graphicRef86421 \">picture 2A-B</a>).</p><p>Tissue specimens, including the nail plate in some instances, should be placed in formalin in separate containers for proper histologic processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Histopathologic examination of the nail plate may provide clinically important information (eg, presence of melanocytic pigmentation, blood, or dematiaceous [pigment producing] fungi). Pathology requisition forms should specify that the tissue samples be sectioned longitudinally (ie, in the sagittal plane) rather than transversely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86403 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Any full thickness biopsy should extend to the depth of the periosteum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the nail bed generally heals without scarring, onycholysis may occasionally occur. To minimize the risk of scarring and subsequent onycholysis, nail bed biopsies should be oriented longitudinally, parallel with the natural ridges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4656802\"><span class=\"h3\">Punch biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before performing a punch biopsy, the nail bed is usually exposed by partial or complete nail avulsion and inspected to select the optimal biopsy site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail avulsion and chemical matricectomy&quot;, section on 'Nail avulsion'</a>.)</p><p>A 3 mm punch is usually adequate to make most diagnoses. Following nail plate removal, the nail bed is assessed to determine the optimal site to achieve a pathologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The area to be biopsied is identified and scored with the punch instrument. Briefly removing the punch and examining the scored nail bed can confirm the exact location. The punch is then placed in exactly the same location and twisted with downward pressure until the instrument contacts the bone. Fine-tipped scissors (Gradle scissors) are inserted perpendicular to the nail bed and gently used to snip the base of the specimen at the level of periosteum. To avoid crush artifact, scissor tips can be used instead of forceps to gently lift and remove the specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The 3 mm defect does not require repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125594357\"><span class=\"h4\">Double punch technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to partial or complete nail avulsion is the double punch technique. In this technique, the nail plate overlying the biopsy site is perforated with a larger size (eg, 5 to 6 mm) punch without injuring the underlying tissue. Soaking the digit in warm water for 10 minutes before the procedure can soften the plate and facilitate the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The nail plate disc is then removed by using the tip of the scalpel and the nail bed is biopsied with a smaller size punch (eg, 3 mm), which can be removed through the larger hole in the nail plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4656955\"><span class=\"h3\">Elliptical excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elliptical (fusiform) excision oriented in the longitudinal axis may be used if a larger sample of the nail bed is biopsied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83965 \">figure 1</a>). The elliptical excision requires full or partial nail avulsion. After excision, the nail bed defect can be repaired with 6.0 resorbable sutures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190722924\"><span class=\"h1\">NAIL FOLD BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for a nail fold biopsy include inflammatory conditions or focal tumors. Nail fold biopsy may be performed using punch, elliptical excision, or tangential (shave) excision techniques. These techniques are the same as those used for cutaneous surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If an excision is necessary in a portion of the nail fold overlying the nail matrix, a Freer septum elevator may be inserted under the nail fold to protect the underlying nail matrix from inadvertent damage by the scalpel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86404\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86404 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In any case of melanonychia with a high preoperative likelihood of melanoma, it is important to perform a full-thickness biopsy. Tangential (shave) excision may not allow the accurate evaluation of Breslow thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Since the distal matrix forms the ventral portion of the nail plate and the proximal matrix forms the dorsal portion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85617 \">figure 2</a>), the sequelae of distal matrix biopsy (thinned ridges) manifest on the undersurface of the nail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1,7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,9-11</a>]. Thinned ridges of the dorsal surface of the nail plate are easily traumatized and may catch on items such as clothing, causing considerable discomfort to the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83966\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83966 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125594684\"><span class=\"h2\">Full thickness techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4656566\"><span class=\"h3\">Punch biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The punch biopsy is generally reserved for sampling longitudinal melanonychia &lt;2.5 to 3 mm in width that originates in the distal matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. A punch biopsy should be taken at the origin of the band and should extend to the depth of the periosteum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83976\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83976 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. It is preferable to remove the entire nidus of pigmentation in the matrix. Sampling a portion of the lesion may result in ambiguous pigmentation after healing.</p><p>Punch biopsy is generally not recommended for evaluating pigmented lesions &ge;3 mm in width because peripheral pigmentation may not be adequately sampled to rule out malignancy. Multiple punch biopsies are also not recommended because they are associated with an increased risk of permanent nail dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4656084\"><span class=\"h3\">Longitudinal elliptical excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A longitudinal elliptical excision of the proximal matrix may be performed as an alternative to punch biopsy to excise lesions causing longitudinal melanonychia &lt;3 mm in width [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Since this technique samples all components of the nail unit, it is also useful for the diagnosis of inflammatory conditions in which the nail bed, nail matrix, nail plate, nail folds, and hyponychium are concurrently involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. </p><p>A number 10 or 15 scalpel blade can be used to cut through the skin and soft tissue down to the periosteum, proximally from a point halfway between the cuticle and the distal interphalangeal skin fold, 1 to 2 mm medial to the pigmented band, through the nail plate, and 3 to 4 mm past the hyponychium onto the digital tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83977\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83977 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The blade can then be reinserted laterally from the previous starting point and the cut made so that the entire matrix horn is included. The cut then courses into the nail sulcus and curves medially at the hyponychium and beyond to meet the end point of the first incision. In this way, the incision is nearly elliptical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83977\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83977 \">picture 7</a>). The tissue specimen is then carefully removed and placed in formalin.<sup> </sup></p><p>Lateral matrix pocket debridement with a small curette or a hemostat tip covered with gauze should be performed before tissue repair to prevent small matrix remnants from being left behind and causing postoperative cysts, spicules, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain.

To minimize any potential scarring, the lesion is removed by excising an elliptical or crescent-shaped wedge of tissue with the distal margin matching the shape of the lunula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83965 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/1,2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125594809\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial thickness techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2729593\"><span class=\"h3\">Tangential (shave) excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tangential (shave) excision is ideal for sampling longitudinal melanonychia that has a low preoperative suspicion of melanoma, is &gt;3 mm in width, and located in the mid-nail plate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83980\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83980 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The tangential shave is also the preferred technique for sampling longitudinal melanonychia of any width originating in the proximal matrix, when the suspicion of melanoma is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,12</a>]. The tangential technique is less invasive than a transversely-oriented matrix excision and is associated with minimal long-term dystrophy despite the larger width of the excised tissue. However, recurrence of pigmentation is common after tangential excision and may require reexcision. In one study, recurrence was observed 8 to 12 months postsurgery in 16 of 23 patients with longitudinal melanonychia treated with tangential excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Releasing incisions are made at the junction of the proximal and lateral nail folds; the proximal nail fold and cuticle are then carefully reflected proximally to expose the underlying matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The nail plate is completely or partially avulsed using an English anvil action nail splitter or similar instrument.
